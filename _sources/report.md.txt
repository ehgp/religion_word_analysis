## Abstract

This project was inspired by this Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mxu578/oc_remix_a_wordcloud_for_each_of_the_six_largest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I noticed the words God, Lord, Allah being mentioned many times and I wanted to get a different context by playing around with different stopwords.

This code produces bar plots of the 10 most common words in the scriptures and a word clouds for each.

## Introduction

### Why did I do this?

While chatting with my brother-in-law, we started wondering if words in different scriptures had similar meanings and to prove it a Reddit search was made. The Reddit word clouds did not show much of a comparison as most comparisons were very similar so I made this instead.
