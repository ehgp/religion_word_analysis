genesis  
 
in the beginning god created the 
heaven and the earth  2now the 
earth was unformed and void  and 
darkness was upon the face of the 
deep  and the spirit of god hovered 
over the f ace of the waters  3and god 
said let there be light  and there 
was light  4and god saw the light  that 
it was good  and god divided the light 
from the darkness  5and god called 
the light day  and the darkness he 
called night  and there was evening 
and t here was morning  one day   
6and god said  let there be a 
firmament in the midst of the waters  
and let it divide the waters from the 
waters  7and god made the 
firmament  and divided the waters 
which were under the firmament from 
the waters which were ab ove the 
firmament  and it was so  8and god 
called the firmament heaven  and 
there was evening and there was 
morning  a second day   
9and god said  let the waters 
under the heaven be gathered together 
unto one place  and let the dry land 
appear  and it wa s so 10and god 
called the dry land earth  and the 
gathering together of the waters called 
he seas  and god saw that it was 
good  11and god said  let the earth 
put forth grass  herb yielding seed  and 
fruittree bearing fruit after its kind  
wherein is th e seed thereof  upon the earth  and it was so  12and the earth 
brought forth grass  herb yielding seed 
after its kind  and tree bearing fruit  
wherein is the seed thereof  after its 
kind and god saw that it was good  
13and there was evening and there was  
morning  a third day   
14and god said  let there be lights 
in the firmament of the heaven to 
divide the day from the night  and let 
them be for signs  and for seasons  and 
for days and years  15and let them be 
for lights in the firmament of the 
heaven to  give light upon the earth  
and it was so  16and god made the 
two great lights  the greater light to 
rule the day  and the lesser light to rule 
the night  and the stars  17and god set 
them in the firmament of the heaven to 
give light upon the earth  18and to rule 
over the day and over the night  and to 
divide the light from the darkness  and 
god saw that it was good  19and there 
was evening and there was morning  a 
fourth day   
20and god said  let the waters 
swarm with swarms of living 
creatures  and let fowl fly above the 
earth in the open firmament of 
heaven  21and god created the great 
seamonsters  and every living creature 
that creepeth  wherewith the waters 
swarmed  after its kind  and every 
winged fowl after its kind  and god 
saw that it was good  22and god 1 genesis  
2 
 blessed them  saying  be fruitful  and 
multiply  and fill the waters in the 
seas and let fowl multiply in the 
earth  23and there was evening and 
there was morning  a fifth day   
24and god said  let the earth bring 
forth the living creature af ter its kind  
cattle  and creeping thing  and beast of 
the earth after its kind  and it was so  
25and god made the beast of the earth 
after its kind  and the cattle after their 
kind and every thing that creepeth 
upon the ground after its kind  and 
god sa w that it was good  26and god 
said let us make man in our image  
after our likeness  and let them have 
dominion over the fish of the sea  and 
over the fowl of the air  and over the 
cattle  and over all the earth  and over 
every creeping thing that creepe th 
upon the earth  27and god created 
man in his own image  in the image of 
god created he him  male and female 
created he them  28and god blessed 
them  and god said unto them  be 
fruitful  and multiply  and replenish 
the earth  and subdue it  and have 
dominion over the fish of the sea  and 
over the fowl of the air  and over every 
living thing that creepeth upon the 
earth  29and god said  behold  i 
have given you every herb yielding 
seed which is upon the face of all the 
earth  and every tree  in which is the 
fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it 
shall be for food  30and to every beast 
of the earth  and to every fowl of the 
air and to every thing that creepeth 
upon the earth  wherein there is a living soul  i have given  every green 
herb for food  and it was so  31and 
god saw every thing that he had 
made  and behold  it was very good  
and there was evening and there was 
morning  the sixth day   
and the heaven and the earth 
were finished  and all the host of 
them  2and on the seventh day god 
finish ed his work which he had made  
and he rested on the seventh day from 
all his work which he had made  3and 
god blessed the seventh day  and 
hallowed it  because that in it he 
rested from all his work which god in 
creating had made   
4these are the generatio ns of the 
heaven and of the earth when they 
were created  in the day that the lord 
god made earth and heaven   
5no shrub of the field was yet in the 
earth  and no herb of the field had yet 
sprung up  for the lord god had not 
caused it to rain upon the eart h and 
there was not a man to till the ground  
6but there went up a mist from the 
earth  and watered the whole face of 
the ground  7then the lord god 
formed man of the dust of the ground  
and breathed into his nostrils the 
breath of life  and man became a living 
soul 8and the lord god planted a 
garden eastward  in eden  and there 
he put the man whom he had formed  
9and out of the ground made the lord 
god to grow every tree that is pleasant 
to the sight  and good for food  the tree 
of life also in the midst  of the garden  
and the tree of the knowledge of good 2 genesis  
3 
 and evil  10and a river went out of 
eden to water the garden  and from 
thence it was parted  and became four 
heads  11the name of the first is 
pishon  that is it which compasseth the 
whole land of havil ah where there is 
gold 12and the gold of that land is 
good  there is bdellium and the onyx 
stone  13and the name of the second 
river is gihon  the same is it that 
compasseth the whole land of cush  
14and the name of the third river is 
atigris  that is it  which goeth toward 
the east of asshur  and the fourth 
river is the euphrates  15and the lord 
god took the man  and put him into 
the garden of eden to dress it and to 
keep it  16and the lord god 
commanded the man  saying  of 
every tree of the garden thou mayest 
freely eat  17but of the tree of the 
knowledge of good and evil  thou shalt 
not eat of it  for in the day that thou 
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die   
18and the lord god said  it is not 
good that the man should be alone  i 
will make him a help  meet for him  
19and out of the ground the lord god 
formed every beast of the field  and 
every fowl of the air  and brought 
them unto the man to see what he 
would call them  and whatsoever the 
man would call every living creature  
that was to be the name thereof  20and 
the man gave names to all cattle  and 
to the fowl of the air  and to every 
beast of the field  but for adam there 
                                                      
a heb hiddekel  was not found a help meet for him  
21and the lord god caused a deep 
sleep to fall upon the man  and he 
slept  and he took one o f his ribs  and 
closed up the place with flesh instead 
thereof  22and the rib  which the lord 
god had taken from the man  made he 
a woman  and brought her unto the 
man 23and the man said  this is now 
bone of my bones  and flesh of my 
flesh  she shall be called bwoman  
because she was taken out of cman 
24therefore shall a man leave his 
father and his mother  and shall cleave 
unto his wife  and they shall be one 
flesh  25and they were both naked  the 
man and his wife  and were not 
ashamed   
now the serp ent was more subtle 
than any beast of the field which 
the lord god had made  and he said 
unto the woman  yea hath god said  
ye shall not eat of any tree of the 
garden  2and the woman said unto 
the serpent  of the fruit of the trees of 
the garden we may  eat 3but of the fruit 
of the tree which is in the midst of the 
garden  god hath said  ye shall not eat 
of it neither shall ye touch it  lest ye 
die 4and the serpent said unto the 
woman  ye shall not surely die  5for 
god doth know that in the day ye e at 
thereof  then your eyes shall be 
opened  and ye shall be as god  
knowing good and evil  6and when 
the woman saw that the tree was good

 for food  and that it was a delight to 
the eyes  and that the tree was to be 
desired to make one wise  she took of 
the fruit thereof  and did eat  and she 
gave also unto her husband with her  
and he did eat  7and the eyes of them 
both were opened  and they knew that 
they were naked  and they sewed fig 
leaves together  and made themselves 
girdles  8and they heard the voic e of 
the lord god walking in the garden 
toward the cool of the day  and the 
man and his wife hid themselves from 
the presence of the lord god amongst 
the trees of the garden  9and the lord 
god called unto the man  and said unto 
him where art thou  10and he said  
i heard thy voice in the garden  and i 
was afraid  because i was naked  and i 
hid myself  11and he said  who told 
thee that thou wast naked  hast thou 
eaten of the tree  whereof i 
commanded thee that thou shouldest 
not eat  12and the man said  the 
woman whom thou gavest to be with 
me she gave me of the tree  and i did 
eat 13and the lord god said unto the 
woman  what is this thou hast done  
and the woman said  the serpent 
beguiled me  and i did eat  14and the 
lord god said unto the serp ent 
because thou hast done this  cursed 
art thou from among all cattle  and 
from among all beasts of the field  
upon thy belly shalt thou go  and dust 
shalt thou eat all the days of thy life  
15and i will put enmity between thee 
and the woman  and betwee n thy seed and her seed  they shall bruise thy 
head  and thou shalt bruise their heel   
16unto the woman he said  i will 
greatly multiply thy pain and thy 
travail  in pain thou shalt bring forth 
children  and thy desire shall be to thy 
husband  and he sh all rule over thee   
17and unto adam he said  because 
thou hast hearkened unto the voice of 
thy wife  and hast eaten of the tree  of 
which i commanded thee  saying  
thou shalt not eat of it  cursed is the 
ground for thy sake  in toil shalt thou 
eat of it  all the days of thy life  
18thorns also and thistles shall it bring 
forth to thee  and thou shalt eat the 
herb of the field  19in the sweat of thy 
face shalt thou eat bread  till thou 
return unto the ground  for out of it 
wast thou taken  for dust thou ar t and 
unto dust shalt thou return  20and the 
man called his wife s name aeve 
because she was the mother of all 
living  21and the lord god made for 
adam and for his wife garments of 
skins  and clothed them   
22and the lord god said  behold  
the man is b ecome as one of us  to 
know good and evil  and now  lest he 
put forth his hand  and take also of the 
tree of life  and eat  and live for ever  
23therefore the lord god sent him 
forth from the garden of eden  to till 
the ground from whence he was taken  
24so he drove out the man  and he 
placed at the east of the garden of 
eden the cherubim  and the flaming

and the man knew eve his wife  
and she conceived and bore cain  
and said  i have agotten a man with 
the help of the lord 2and again she 
bore his brother abel  and abel was a 
keeper of sheep  but cain was a tiller 
of the ground  3and in process of time 
it came to pass  that cain brought of 
the fruit of the ground an offering unto 
the lord 4and abel  he also brought 
of the firstlings of his flock and of the 
fat thereof  and the lord had respect 
unto abel and to his offering  5but 
unto cain and to his offering he had 
not respect  and cain was very wroth  
and his countenance fell  6and th e 
lord said unto cain  why art thou 
wroth  and why is thy countenance 
fallen  7if thou doest well  shall it not 
be lifted up  and if thou doest not well  
sin coucheth at the door  and unto thee 
is its desire  but thou mayest rule over 
it 8and cain spoke  unto abel his 
brother  and it came to pass  when 
they were in the field  that cain rose 
up against abel his brother  and slew 
him  
9and the lord said unto cain  
where is abel thy brother  and he 
said i know not  am i my brother s 
keeper  10and he sa id what hast 
thou done  the voice of thy brother s 
blood crieth unto me from the ground  
11and now cursed art thou from the 
ground  which hath opened her mouth

hand  12when thou tillest the ground  it 
shall not hen ceforth yield unto thee her 
strength  a fugitive and a wanderer 
shalt thou be in the earth  13and cain 
said unto the lord my punishment is 
greater than i can bear  14behold  thou 
hast driven me out this day from the 
face of the land  and from thy face 
shall i be hid  and i shall be a fugitive 
and a wanderer in the earth  and it will 
come to pass  that whosoever findeth 
me will slay me  15and the lord said 
unto him  therefore whosoever 
slayeth cain  vengeance shall be taken 
on him sevenfold  and the lord set a 
sign for cain  lest any finding him 
should smite him   
16and cain went out from the 
presence of the lord and dwelt in the 
land of bnod on the east of eden  
17and cain knew his wife  and she 
conceived  and bore enoch  and he

after that  when the sons of god came 
in unto the daughters of men  and they 
bore children to them  the same were

men of renown   
5and the lord saw that the 
wickedness of man was great in the  
earth  and that every imagination of 
the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
continually  6and it repented the lord 
that he had made man on the earth  
and it grieved him at his heart  7and 
the lord said i will blot out man 
whom i have created from the f ace of 
the earth  both man  and beast  and 
creeping thing  and fowl of the air  for 
it repenteth me that i have made 
them  8but noah found grace in the 
eyes of the lord  
 
9these are the generations of noah  
noah was in his generations a man 
righteous and wholehearted  noah 
walked with god  10and noah begot

and behold  it was corrupt  for all 
flesh had corrupted their way upon the 
earth   6 genesis

ark and to a cubit shalt thou finish it

thou set in the side thereof  with lower

make it  17and i  behold  i do bring the 
flood of waters upon the earth  to

of life  from under heaven  every thing 
that is in the earth shall perish  18but i 
will establish my covenant with thee  
and thou shalt come into the ark  thou 
and thy  sons and thy wife  and thy 
sonswives with thee  19and of every 
living thing of all flesh  two of every 
sort shalt thou bring into the ark  to 
keep them alive with thee  they shall

their kind  and of the cattle aft er their 
kind of every creeping thing of the 
ground after its kind  two of every sort 
shall come unto thee  to keep them 
alive  21and take thou unto thee of all 
food that is eaten  and gather it to thee  
and it shall be for food for thee  and 
for them  22thus did noah  according to all that god commanded him  so did 
he  
and the lord said unto noah  
come thou and all thy house into 
the ark  for thee have i seen righteous 
before me in this generation  2of every 
clean beast thou shalt take to thee 
seven and seven  each with his mate  
and of the beasts that are not clean two 
and two  each with his mate  3of the 
fowl also of the air  seven and seven  
male and female  to keep seed alive 
upon the face of all the earth  4for yet 
seven days  and i will cause it to rain 
upon the earth forty days and forty 
nights  and every living substance that 
i have made will i blot out from off the 
face of the earth  5and noah did 
according unto all that the lord 
commanded him   
6and noah was six hundred years old 
when the flood of waters was upon the 
earth  7and noah went in  and his 
sons and his wife  and his sons wives 
with him  into the ark  because of the 
waters of the flood  8of clean beasts  
and of beasts that are not clean  and of 
fowls  and of every thing that cree peth 
upon the ground  9there went in two 
and two unto noah into the ark  male 
and female  as god commanded noah  
10and it came to pass after the seven 
days that the waters of the flood were 
upon the earth  11in the six hundredth 
year of noah s life  in th e second 
month  on the seventeenth day of the 
month  on the same day were all the 
fountains of the great deep broken up  
and the windows of heaven were 7 genesis

 opened  12and the rain was upon the 
earth forty days and forty nights   
13in the selfsame day entered no ah 
and shem  and ham  and japheth  the 
sons of noah  and noah s wife  and 
the three wives of his sons with them  
into the ark  14they and every beast 
after its kind  and all the cattle after 
their kind  and every creeping thing 
that creepeth upon the ear th after its 
kind and every fowl after its kind  
every bird of every sort  15and they 
went in unto noah into the ark  two 
and two of all flesh wherein is the 
breath of life  16and they that went in  
went in male and female of all flesh  as 
god commanded h im and the lord 
shut him in  17and the flood was forty 
days upon the earth  and the waters 
increased  and bore up the ark  and it 
was lifted up above the earth  18and 
the waters prevailed  and increased 
greatly upon the earth  and the ark 
went upon the fa ce of the waters  
19and the waters prevailed 
exceedingly upon the earth  and all the 
high mountains that were under the 
whole heaven were covered  20fifteen 
cubits upward did the waters prevail  
and the mountains were covered  
21and all flesh perished that  moved 
upon the earth  both fowl  and cattle  
and beast  and every swarming thing 
that swarmeth upon the earth  and 
every man  22all in whose nostrils was 
the breath of the spirit of life  
whatsoever was in the dry land  died 
23and he blotted out every li ving 
substance which was upon the face of the ground  both man  and cattle  and 
creeping thing  and fowl of the heaven  
and they were blotted out from the 
earth  and noah only was left  and 
they that were with him in the ark  
24and the waters prevailed upo n the 
earth a hundred and fifty days   
and god remembered noah  and 
every living thing  and all the 
cattle that were with him in the ark  
and god made a wind to pass over the 
earth  and the waters assuaged  2the 
fountains also of the deep and the 
windows  of heaven were stopped  and 
the rain from heaven was restrained  
3and the waters returned from off the 
earth continually  and after the end of 
a hundred and fifty days the waters 
decreased  4and the ark rested in the 
seventh month  on the seventeenth day 
of the month  upon the mountains of 
ararat  5and the waters decreased 
continually until the tenth month  in 
the tenth month  on the first day of the 
month  were the tops of the mountains 
seen  
6and it came to pass at the end of 
forty days  that noah opene d the 
window of the ark which he had made  
7and he sent forth a raven  and it went 
forth to and fro  until the waters were 
dried up from off the earth  8and he 
sent forth a dove from him  to see if 
the waters were abated from off the 
face of the ground  9but the dove 
found no rest for the sole of her foot  
and she returned unto him to the ark  
for the waters were on the face of the 
whole earth  and he put forth his hand  8 genesis  
10 
 and took her  and brought her in unto 
him into the ark  10and he stayed yet 
other seven  days and again he sent 
forth the dove out of the ark  11and the 
dove came in to him at eventide  and 
lo in her mouth an olive leaf freshly 
plucked  so noah knew that the waters 
were abated from off the earth  12and 
he stayed yet other seven days  and 
sent forth the dove  and she returned 
not again unto him any more   
13and it came to pass in the six 
hundred and first year  in the first 
month  the first day of the month  the 
waters were dried up from off the 
earth  and noah removed the covering 
of the ark  and looked  and behold  the 
face of the ground was dried  14and in 
the second month  on the seven and 
twentieth day of the month  was the 
earth dry   
15and god spoke unto noah  
saying  16go forth from the ark  thou 
and thy wife  and thy sons  and thy 
sonswives with thee  17bring forth 
with thee every living thing that is 
with thee of all flesh  both fowl  and 
cattle  and every creeping thing that 
creepeth upon the earth  that they may 
swarm in the earth  and be fruitful  and 
multiply upon the earth  18and noah 
went forth  and his sons  and his wife  
and his sons wives with him  19every 
beast  every creeping thing  and every 
fowl whatsoever moveth upon the 
earth  after their families  went forth 
out of the ark   
20and noah builded an altar unto 
the lord and took of every clean beast  and of every clean fowl  and 
offered burnt offerings on the altar  
21and the lord smelled the sweet 
savour  and the lord said in his heart  
i will not again curse the ground any 
more for man s sake  for the 
imagination of mans heart is evil from 
his youth  neither will i again smite 
any more every thing living  as i have 
done  22while the earth remaineth  
seedtime and harvest  and cold and 
heat and summer and winter  and day 
and night shall not cease   
and god blessed noah and his 
sons and said unto them  be 
fruitful and multiply  and replenish the 
earth  2and the fear of you and the 
dread of you shall be upon every beast 
of the earth  and upon every fowl of 
the air  and upon all wherewith the 
ground teemeth  and upon  all the 
fishes of the sea  into your hand are 
they delivered  3every moving thing 
that liveth shall be for food for you  as 
the green herb have i given you all  
4only flesh with the life thereof  which 
is the blood thereof  shall ye not eat  
5and surely y our blood of your lives 
will i require  at the hand of every 
beast will i require it  and at the hand 
of man  even at the hand of every 
mans brother  will i require the life of 
man 6whoso sheddeth man s blood  
by man shall his blood be shed  for in 
the image of god made he man  7and 
you be ye fruitful  and multiply  
swarm in the earth  and multiply 
therein   9 genesis  
11 
 8and god spoke unto noah  and to 
his sons with him  saying  9as for me  
behold  i establish my covenant with 
you and with your seed after you  
10and with every living creature that is 
with you  the fowl  the cattle  and 
every beast of the earth with you  of 
all that go out of the ark  even every 
beast of the earth  11and i will 
establish my covenant with you  
neither shall all flesh be cut off any 
more by the waters of the flood  
neither shall there any more be a flood 
to destroy the earth  12and god said  
this is the token of the covenant 
which i make between me and you 
and every living creature that is with 
you for perpetual generations  13i have 
set my bow in the cloud  and it shall 
be for a token of a covenant between 
me and the earth  14and it shall come 
to pass  when i bring clouds over the 
earth  and the bow is seen in the cloud  
15that i will remember my covenant  
which is between me and y ou and 
every living creature of all flesh  and 
the waters shall no more become a 
flood to destroy all flesh  16and the 
bow shall be in the cloud  and i will 
look upon it  that i may remember the 
everlasting covenant between god and 
every living creature of  all flesh that is 
upon the earth  17and god said unto 
noah  this is the token of the 
covenant which i have established 
between me and all flesh that is upon 
the earth   
18and the sons of noah  that went 
forth from the ark  were shem  and ham  and japhe th and ham is the 
father of canaan  19these three were 
the sons of noah  and of these was the 
whole earth overspread   
20and noah the husbandman began  
and planted a vineyard  21and he drank 
of the wine  and was drunken  and he 
was uncovered within his te nt 22and 
ham  the father of canaan  saw the 
nakedness of his father  and told his 
two brethren without  23and shem and 
japheth took a garment  and laid it 
upon both their shoulders  and went 
backward  and covered the nakedness 
of their father  and their f aces were 
backward  and they saw not their 
father s nakedness  24and noah awoke 
from his wine  and knew what his 
youngest son had done unto him  
25and he said   
cursed be canaan  a servant of 
servants shall he be unto his 
brethren   
26and he said   
blessed  be the lord the god of 
shem   
and let canaan be their servant   
27god aenlarge japheth  and he shall 
dwell in the tents of shem   
and let canaan be their servant   
28and noah lived after the flood 
three hundred and fifty years  29and all 
the days of noah  were nine hundred 
and fifty years  and he died   
 
now these are the generations 
of the sons of noah  shem

began to be a mighty one  in the earth  
9he was a mighty hunter before the 
lord wherefore it is said  like 
nimrod a mighty hunter before the 
lord 10and the beginning of his 
kingdom was babel  and erech  and 
accad  and calneh  in the land of 
shinar  11out of that land went fort h 
asshur  and builded nineveh  and 
rehoboth ir and calah  12and resen 
between nineveh and calah the 
same is the great city  13and mizraim 
begot ludim  and anamim  and 
lehabim  and naphtuhim  14and 
pathrusim  and casluhim whence 
went forth the philistines and 
caphtorim   
15and canaan begot zidon his 
firstborn  and heth  16and the jebusite  
and the amorite  and the girgashite  
17and the hivite  and the arkite  and the sinite  18and the arvadite  and the 
zemarite  and the hamathite  and 
afterward were the fam ilies of the 
canaanite spread abroad  19and the 
border of the canaanite was from 
zidon  as thou goest toward gerar  
unto gaza  as thou goest toward 
sodom and gomorrah and admah and 
zeboiim  unto lasha  20these are the 
sons of ham  after their families  after 
their tongues  in their lands  in their 
nations   
21and unto shem  the father of all 
the children of eber  the elder brother 
of japheth  to him also were children

begot eber  25and unto eber were born 
two sons  the name of the one was 
apeleg  for in his days was the earth 
divided  and his brother s name was 
joktan  26and joktan  begot almodad  
and sheleph  and hazarmaveth  and 
jerah  27and hadoram  and uzal  and 
diklah  28and obal  and abimael  and 
sheba  29and ophir  and havilah  and 
jobab  all these were the sons of 
joktan  30and their dwelling was from 
mesha  as thou goest tow ard sephar  
unto the mountain of the east  31these 
are the sons of shem  after their 
families  after their tongues  in their 
lands  after their nations   
                                                      
a that is division  genesis  
13 
 32these are the families of the sons 
of noah  after their generations  in 
their nations  and of these were the 
nations divided in the earth after the 
flood   
and the whole earth was of 
one language and of one 
speech  2and it came to pass  as they 
journeyed east  that they found a plain 
in the land of shinar  and they dwelt 
there  3and they said one to a nother  
come  let us make brick  and burn 
them thoroughly  and they had brick 
for stone  and slime had they for 
mortar  4and they said  come  let us 
build us a city  and a tower  with its 
top in heaven  and let us make us a 
name  lest we be scattered ab road 
upon the face of the whole earth  
5and the lord came down to see the 
city and the tower  which the children 
of men builded  6and the lord said 
behold  they are one people  and they 
have all one language  and this is what 
they begin to do  and now n othing will 
be withholden from them  which they 
purpose to do  7come  let us go down  
and there confound their language  that 
they may not understand one another s 
speech  8so the lord scattered them 
abroad from thence upon the face of 
all the earth  and they left off to build 
the city  9therefore was the name of it 
called babel  because the lord did 
there aconfound the language of all the 
earth  and from thence did the lord 
                                                      
a heb balal  to confound  scatter them abroad upon the face of 
all the earth   
 
10these are the generations of shem  
shem was a hundred years old  and 
begot arpachshad two years after the 
flood  11and shem lived after he begot

begot nahor  23and serug lived after  
he begot nahor two hundred years  
and begot sons and daughters   
24and nahor lived nine and twenty 
years  and begot terah  25and nahor 
lived after he begot terah a hundred 11 genesis  
14 
 and nineteen years  and begot sons and 
daughters   
26and terah lived seventy years  
and begot abram  nahor  and haran  
27now these are the generations of 
terah  terah begot abram  nahor  and 
haran  and haran begot lot  28and 
haran died in the presence of his 
father terah in the land of his nativity  
in ur of the chaldees  29and abram 
and nahor took them wives  the name 
of abram s wife was sarai  and the 
name of nahor s wife  milcah  the 
daughter of haran  the father of 
milcah  and the father of iscah  30and 
sarai was barren  she had no child  
31and terah took abram his son  and 
lot the so n of haran  his son s son  
and sarai his daughter inlaw his son 
abram s wife  and they went forth 
with them from ur of the chaldees  to 
go into the land of canaan  and they 
came unto haran  and dwelt there  
32and the days of terah were two 
hundred and fi ve years  and terah died 
in haran   
   
now the lord said unto 
abram  get thee out of thy 
country  and from thy kindred  and 
from thy father s house  unto the land 
that i will show thee  2and i will make 
of thee a great nation  and i will bless 
thee and make thy name great  and be 
thou a blessing  3and i will bless them 
that bless thee  and him that curseth 
thee will i curse  and in thee shall all 
the families of the earth be blessed  
4so abram went  as the lord had spoken unto him  and lot went with 
him and abram was seventy and fiv e 
years old when he departed out of 
haran  5and abram took sarai his 
wife and lot his brother s son  and all 
their substance that they had gathered  
and the souls that they had gotten in 
haran  and they went forth to go into 
the land of canaan  and into t he land 
of canaan they came  6and abram 
passed through the land unto the place 
of shechem  unto the terebinth of 
moreh  and the canaanite was then in 
the land  7and the lord appeared unto 
abram  and said  unto thy seed will i 
give this land  and he build ed there an 
altar unto the lord who appeared unto 
him 8and he removed from thence 
unto the mountain on the east of beth 
el and pitched his tent  having beth el 
on the west  and ai on the east  and he 
builded there an altar unto the lord 
and called upon  the name of the lord 
9and abram journeyed  going on still 
toward the south   
10and there was a famine in the 
land and abram went down into 
egypt to sojourn there  for the famine 
was sore in the land  11and it came to 
pass when he was come near to enter  
into egypt  that he said unto sarai his 
wife behold now  i know that thou 
art a fair woman to look upon  12and it 
will come to pass  when the egyptians 
shall see thee  that they will say  this 
is his wife  and they will kill me  but 
thee they will keep alive  13say i pray 
thee thou art my sister  that it may be 
well with me for thy sake  and that my 12 genesis  
15 
 soul may live because of thee  14and 
it came to pass  that when abram was 
come into egypt  the egyptians beheld 
the woman that she was very fair  
15and t he princes of pharaoh saw her  
and praised her to pharaoh  and the 
woman was taken into pharaoh s 
house  16and he dealt well with abram 
for her sake  and he had sheep  and 
oxen  and he asses  and men servants  
and maid servants  and she asses  and 
camels  17and the lord plagued 
pharaoh and his house with great 
plagues because of sarai abram s 
wife 18and pharaoh called abram  
and said  what is this that thou hast 
done unto me  why didst thou not tell 
me that she was thy wife  19why 
saidst thou  she is my s ister so that i 
took her to be my wife  now therefore 
behold thy wife  take her  and go thy 
way 20and pharaoh gave men charge 
concerning him  and they brought him 
on the way  and his wife  and all that 
he had   
and abram went up out of 
egypt  he and his wife  and all 
that he had  and lot with him  into the 
south  2and abram was very rich in 
cattle  in silver  and in gold  3and he 
went on his journeys from the south 
even to beth el unto the place where 
his tent had been at the beginning  
between beth el and ai  4unto the 
place of the altar  which he had made 
there at the first  and abram called 
there on the name of the lord 5and 
lot also  who went with abram  had 
flocks  and herds  and tents  6and the land was not able to bear them  that 
they might d well together  for their 
substance was great  so that they could 
not dwell together  7and there was a 
strife between the herdmen of abram s 
cattle and the herdmen of lot s cattle  
and the canaanite and the perizzite 
dwelt then in the land  8and abram 
said unto lot  let there be no strife  i 
pray thee  between me and thee  and 
between my herdmen and thy 
herdmen  for we are brethren  9is not 
the whole land before thee  separate 
thyself  i pray thee  from me  if thou 
wilt take the left hand  then i will go to  
the right  or if thou take the right hand  
then i will go to the left  10and lot 
lifted up his eyes  and beheld all the 
plain of the jordan  that it was well 
watered every where  before the lord 
destroyed sodom and gomorrah  like 
the garden of the lord like the land of 
egypt  as thou goest unto zoar  11so 
lot chose him all the plain of the 
jordan  and lot journeyed east  and 
they separated themselves the one 
from the other  12abram dwelt in the 
land of canaan  and lot dwelt in the 
cities of the plain  and moved his tent 
as far as sodom  13now the men of 
sodom were wicked and sinners 
against the lord exceedingly  14and 
the lord said unto abram  after that 
lot was separated from him  lift up 
now thine eyes  and look from the 
place where thou art  northward  and 
southward and eastward and 
westward  15for all the land which thou 
seest  to thee will i give it  and to thy 13 genesis  
16 
 seed for ever  16and i will make thy 
seed as the dust of the earth  so that if 
a man can number the dust of the 
earth  then shall thy seed als o be 
numbered  17arise  walk through the 
land in the length of it and in the 
breadth of it  for unto thee will i give 
it 18and abram moved his tent  and 
came and dwelt by the terebinths of 
mamre  which are in hebron  and built 
there an altar unto the lord  
and it came to pass in the 
days of amraphel king of 
shinar  arioch king of ellasar  
chedorlaomer king of elam  and tidal 
king of goiim  2that they made war 
with bera king of sodom  and with 
birsha king of gomorrah  shinab king 
of admah  and shemeber  king of 
zeboiim  and the king of bela the 
same is zoar  3all these came as allies 
unto the vale of siddim the same is 
the salt sea  4twelve years they 
served chedorlaomer  and in the 
thirteenth year they rebelled  5and in 
the fourteenth year came 
chedorla omer and the kings that were 
with him  and smote the rephaim in 
ashteroth karnaim  and the zuzim in 
ham  and the emim in shaveh 
kiriathaim  6and the horites in their 
mount seir  unto el paran  which is by 
the wilderness  7and they turned back  
and came to enmishpat the same is 
kadesh and smote all the country of 
the amalekites  and also the amorites  
that dwelt in hazazon tamar  8and 
there went out the king of sodom  and 
the king of gomorrah  and the king of admah  and the king of zeboiim  and 
the king of belathe same is zoar  
and they set the battle in array against 
them in the vale of siddim  9against 
chedorlaomer king of elam  and tidal 
king of goiim  and amraphel king of 
shinar  and arioch king of ellasar  
four kings against the five  10now the 
vale of  siddim was full of slime pits  
and the kings of sodom and gomorrah 
fled and they fell there  and they that 
remained fled to the mountain  11and 
they took all the goods of sodom and 
gomorrah  and all their victuals  and 
went their way  12and they took lot  
abram s brother s son  who dwelt in 
sodom  and his goods  and departed  
13and there came one that had 
escaped  and told abram the 
hebrew now he dwelt by the 
terebinths of mamre the amorite  
brother of eshcol  and brother of aner  
and these were confedera te with 
abram  14and when abram heard that 
his brother was taken captive  he led 
forth his trained men  born in his 
house  three hundred and eighteen  and 
pursued as far as dan  15and he 
divided himself against them by night  
he and his servants  and smote  them  
and pursued them unto hobah  which 
is on the left hand of damascus  16and 
he brought back all the goods  and also 
brought back his brother lot  and his 
goods  and the women also  and the 
people  17and the king of sodom went 
out to meet him  after hi s return from 
the slaughter of chedorlaomer and the 
kings that were with him  at the vale of 14 genesis  
17 
 shaveh the same is the king s vale  
18and melchizedek king of salem 
brought forth bread and wine  and he 
was priest of god the most high  
19and he blessed him  and said 
blessed be abram of god most high  
maker of heaven and earth  20and 
blessed be god the most high  who 
hath delivered thine enemies into thy 
hand  and he gave him a tenth of all  
21and the king of sodom said unto 
abram  give me the persons  and ta ke 
the goods to thyself  22and abram 
said to the king of sodom  i have 
lifted up my hand unto the lord god 
most high  maker of heaven and 
earth  23that i will not take a thread nor 
a shoe latchet nor aught that is thine  
lest thou shouldest say  i have made 
abram rich  24save only that which the 
young men have eaten  and the portion 
of the men which went with me  aner  
eshcol  and mamre  let them take their 
portion   
after these things the word of 
the lord came unto abram in 
a vision  saying  fear n ot abram  i 
am thy shield  thy reward shall be 
exceeding great  2and abram said  o 
lord g od what wilt thou give me  
seeing i go hence childless  and he that 
shall be possessor of my house is 
eliezer of damascus  3and abram 
said behold  to me thou ha st given 
no seed  and lo one born in my house 
is to be mine heir  4and behold  the 
word of the lord came unto him  
saying  this man shall not be thine 
heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir  
5and he brought him  forth abroad  
and said  look now toward heaven  
and count the stars  if thou be able to 
count them  and he said unto him  
so shall thy seed be  6and he 
believed in the lord and he counted 
it to him for righteousness  7and he 
said unto him  i am the lord that 
brought thee out of ur of the chaldees  
to give thee this land to inherit it  
8and he said  o lord g od whereby 
shall i know that i shall inherit it  
9and he said unto him  take me a 
heifer of three years old  and a she 
goat of three years ol d and a ram of 
three years old  and a turtle dove  and 
a young pigeon  10and he took him all 
these  and divided them in the midst  
and laid each half over against the 
other  but the birds divided he not  
11and the birds of prey came down 
upon the carcass es and abram drove 
them away  12and it came to pass  that 
when the sun was going down  a deep 
sleep fell upon abram  and lo a 
dread  even a great darkness  fell upon 
him 13and he said unto abram  
know of a surety that thy seed shall 
be a stranger in a land that is not 
theirs  and shall serve them  and they 
shall afflict them four hundred years  
14and also that nation  whom they shall 
serve  will i judge  and afterward shall 
they come out with great substance  
15but thou shalt go to thy fathers in 
peace thou shalt be buried in a good 
old age  16and in the fourth generation 
they shall come back hither  for the 15 genesis  
18 
 iniquity of the amorite is not yet full  
17and it came to pass  that when the 
sun went down  and there was thick 
darkness  behold a smoking fur nace 
and a flaming torch that passed 
between these pieces  18in that day the 
lord made a covenant with abram  
saying  unto thy seed have i given 
this land  from the river of egypt unto 
the great river  the river euphrates  
19the kenite  and the kenizzite  and the 
kadmonite  20and the hittite  and the 
perizzite  and the rephaim  21and the 
amorite  and the canaanite  and the 
girgashite  and the jebusite   
now sarai abram s wife bore 
him no children  and she had a 
handmaid  an egyptian  whose name 
was ha gar 2and sarai said unto 
abram  behold now  the lord hath 
restrained me from bearing  go in  i 
pray thee  unto my handmaid  it may 
be that i shall be builded up through 
her and abram hearkened to the 
voice of sarai  3and sarai abram s 
wife took hagar t he egyptian  her 
handmaid  after abram had dwelt ten 
years in the land of canaan  and gave 
her to abram her husband to be his 
wife 4and he went in unto hagar  and 
she conceived  and when she saw that 
she had conceived  her mistress was 
despised in her eye s 5and sarai said 
unto abram  my wrong be upon thee  
i gave my handmaid into thy bosom  
and when she saw that she had 
conceived  i was despised in her eyes  
the lord judge between me and thee  
6but abram said unto sarai  behold  thy maid is in thy hand  do to her that 
which is good in thine eyes  and 
sarai dealt harshly with her  and she 
fled from her face  7and the angel of 
the lord found her by a fountain of 
water in the wilderness  by the 
fountain in the way to shur  8and he 
said hagar  sarai s ha ndmaid  
whence camest thou  and whither 
goest thou  and she said  i flee from 
the face of my mistress sarai  9and 
the angel of the lord said unto her  
return to thy mistress  and submit 
thyself under her hands  10and the 
angel of the lord said unto he r i will 
greatly multiply thy seed  that it shall 
not be numbered for multitude  11and 
the angel of the lord said unto her  
behold  thou art with child  and shalt 
bear a son  and thou shalt call his 
name aishmael  because the lord hath 
heard thy afflict ion 12and he shall be 
a wild ass of a man  his hand shall be 
against every man  and every man s 
hand against him  and he shall dwell in 
the face of all his brethren  13and she 
called the name of the lord that spoke 
unto her  thou art ba god of seeing  
for she said  have i even here seen 
him that seeth me  14wherefore the 
well was called cbeer lahai roi 
behold  it is between kadesh and 
bered  15and hagar bore abram a son  
and abram called the name of his son

 whom hagar bore  ishmael  16and 
abram was fo urscore and six years 
old when hagar bore ishmael to 
abram   
and when abram was ninety 
years old and nine  the lord 
appeared to abram  and said unto him  
i am god almighty  walk before me  
and be thou wholehearted  2and i will 
make my covenant between  me and 
thee and will multiply thee 
exceedingly  3and abram fell on his 
face and god talked with him  saying  
4as for me  behold  my covenant is 
with thee  and thou shalt be athe father 
of a multitude of nations  5neither 
shall thy name any more be cal led 
abram  but thy name shall be 
abraham  for the father of a multitude 
of nations have i made thee  6and i 
will make thee exceeding fruitful  and 
i will make nations of thee  and kings 
shall come out of thee  7and i will 
establish my covenant between me 
and thee and thy seed after thee 
throughout their generations for an 
everlasting covenant  to be a god unto 
thee and to thy seed after thee  8and i 
will give unto thee  and to thy seed 
after thee  the land of thy sojournings  
all the land of canaan  for an 
everlasting possession  and i will be 
their god  9and god said unto 
abraham  and as for thee  thou shalt 
keep my covenant  thou and thy seed 
after thee throughout their generations  
10this is my covenant  which ye shall 
                                                      
a heb ab hamon  keep  between me and you and thy 
seed after thee  every male among you 
shall be circumcised  11and ye shall be 
circumcised in the flesh of your 
foreskin  and it shall be a token of a 
covenant betwixt me and you  12and 
he that is eight days old shall be 
circumcised among you  every male 
throughout your generations  he that is 
born in the house  or bought with 
money of any foreigner  that is not of 
thy seed  13he that is born in thy 
house  and he that is bought with thy 
money  must needs be circumcised  
and my covenant shall be in your flesh  
for an everlasting covenant  14and the 
uncircumcised male who is not 
circumcised in the flesh of his 
foreskin  that soul shall be cut off from 
his people  he hath broken my 
covenant   
15and god said unto abraham  as 
for sarai thy wife  thou shalt not ca ll 
her name sarai  but bsarah shall her 
name be  16and i will bless her  and 
moreover i will give thee a son of her  
yea i will bless her  and she shall be a 
mother of nations  kings of peoples 
shall be of her  17then abraham fell 
upon his face  and laug hed and said in 
his heart  shall a child be born unto 
him that is a hundred years old  and 
shall sarah  that is ninety years old  
bear 18and abraham said unto god  
oh that ishmael might live before 
thee   19and god said  nay but 
sarah thy wife sha ll bear thee a son  
                                                      
b that is princess  17 genesis  
20 
 and thou shalt call his name aisaac  and 
i will establish my covenant with him 
for an everlasting covenant for his 
seed after him  20and as for ishmael  i 
have heard thee  behold  i have blessed 
him and will make him fruitful  and 
will multiply him exceedingly  twelve 
princes shall he beget  and i will make 
him a great nation  21but my covenant 
will i establish with isaac  whom 
sarah shall bear unto thee at this set 
time in the next year  22and he left 
off talking with him  and god wen t up 
from abraham  23and abraham took 
ishmael his son  and all that were born 
in his house  and all that were bought 
with his money  every male among the 
men of abraham s house  and 
circumcised the flesh of their foreskin 
in the selfsame day  as god had sa id 
unto him  24and abraham was ninety 
years old and nine  when he was 
circumcised in the flesh of his 
foreskin  25and ishmael his son was 
thirteen years old  when he was 
circumcised in the flesh of his 
foreskin  26in the selfsame day was 
abraham circumcise d and ishmael his 
son 27and all the men of his house  
those born in the house  and those 
bought with money of a foreigner  
were circumcised with him   
 
 
and the lord appeared unto 
him by the terebinths of 
                                                      
a from the heb root meaning to 
laugh  mamre  as he sat in the tent door in the 
heat of the day  2and he lifted up his 
eyes and looked  and lo three men 
stood over against him  and when he 
saw them  he ran to meet them from 
the tent door  and bowed down to the 
earth  3and said  my lord  if now i 
have found favour in thy sight  pass 
not away  i pray thee  from thy 
servant  4let now a little water be 
fetched  and wash your feet  and 
recline yourselves under the tree  5and 
i will fetch a morsel of bread  and stay 
ye your heart  after that ye shall pass 
on forasmuch as ye are come to yo ur 
servant  and they said  so do  as 
thou hast said  6and abraham 
hastened into the tent unto sarah  and 
said make ready quickly three 
measures of fine meal  knead it  and 
make cakes  7and abraham ran unto 
the herd  and fetched a calf tender and 
good  and gave it unto the servant  and 
he hastened to dress it  8and he took 
curd and milk  and the calf which he 
had dressed  and set it before them  
and he stood by them under the tree  
and they did eat  9and they said unto 
him where is sarah thy wife  and 
he said  behold  in the tent  10and he 
said i will certainly return unto thee 
when the season cometh round  and 
lo sarah thy wife shall have a son  
and sarah heard in the tent door  
which was behind him 11now 
abraham and sarah were old  and wel l 
stricken in age  it had ceased to be 
with sarah after the manner of 
women 12and sarah laughed within 18 genesis  
21 
 herself  saying  after i am waxed old 
shall i have pleasure  my lord being 
old also  13and the lord said unto 
abraham  wherefore did sarah laugh  
saying shall i of a surety bear a child  
who am old  14is any thing too hard 
for the lord at the set time i will 
return unto thee  when the season 
cometh round  and sarah shall have a 
son 15then sarah denied  saying  i 
laughed not  for she was afraid  and 
he said  nay but thou didst laugh   
16and the men rose up from thence  
and looked out toward sodom  and 
abraham went with them to bring 
them on the way  17and the lord said 
shall i hide from abraham that which 
i am doing  18seeing that abraham 
shall surely become a great and mighty 
nation  and all the nations of the earth 
shall be blessed in him  19for i have 
known him  to the end that he may 
command his children and his 
household after him  that they may 
keep the way of the lord to do 
righteousnes s and justice  to the end 
that the lord may bring upon 
abraham that which he hath spoken 
of him  20and the lord said verily  
the cry of sodom and gomorrah is 
great  and verily  their sin is 
exceeding grievous  21i will go down 
now and see whether they  have done 
altogether according to the cry of it  
which is come unto me  and if not  i 
will know  22and the men turned from 
thence  and went toward sodom  but 
abraham stood yet before the lord 
23and abraham drew near  and said  wilt thou indeed sweep aw ay the 
righteous with the wicked  
24peradventure there are fifty righteous 
within the city  wilt thou indeed 
sweep away and not forgive the place 
for the fifty righteous that are therein  
25that be far from thee to do after this 
manner  to slay the righteo us with the 
wicked  that so the righteous should be 
as the wicked  that be far from thee  
shall not the judge of all the earth do 
justly  26and the lord said if i find 
in sodom fifty righteous within the 
city then i will forgive all the place 
for their  sake 27and abraham 
answered and said  behold now  i 
have taken upon me to speak unto the 
lord  who am but dust and ashes  
28peradventure there shall lack five of 
the fifty righteous  wilt thou destroy 
all the city for lack of five  and he 
said i wil l not destroy it  if i find 
there forty and five  29and he spoke 
unto him yet again  and said  
peradventure there shall be forty 
found there  and he said  i will not 
do it for the forty s sake  30and he 
said oh let not the lord be angry  
and i will  speak  peradventure there 
shall thirty be found there  and he 
said i will not do it  if i find thirty 
there  31and he said  behold now  i 
have taken upon me to speak unto the 
lord  peradventure there shall be 
twenty found there  and he said  i 
will not destroy it for the twenty s 
sake 32and he said  oh let not the 
lord be angry  and i will speak yet but 
this once  peradventure ten shall be genesis  
22 
 found there  and he said  i will not 
destroy it for the ten s sake  33and the 
lord went his way  as soon  as he had 
left off speaking to abraham  and 
abraham returned unto his place   
and the two angels came to 
sodom at even  and lot sat in 
the gate of sodom  and lot saw them  
and rose up to meet them  and he fell 
down on his face to the earth  2and he 
said behold now  my lords  turn 
aside  i pray you  into your servant s 
house  and tarry all night  and wash 
your feet  and ye shall rise up early  
and go on your way  and they said  
nay but we will abide in the broad 
place all night  3and he urged them 
greatly  and they turned in unto him  
and entered into his house  and he 
made them a feast  and did bake 
unleavened bread  and they did eat  
4but before they lay down  the men of 
the city  even the men of sodom  
compassed the house round  both 
young and ol d all the people from 
every quarter  5and they called unto 
lot and said unto him  where are the 
men that came in to thee this night  
bring them out unto us  that we may 
know them  6and lot went out unto 
them to the door  and shut the door 
after him  7and he said  i pray you  
my brethren  do not so wickedly  
8behold now  i have two daughters 
that have not known man  let me  i 
pray you  bring them out unto you  and 
do ye to them as is good in your eyes  
only unto these men do nothing  
forasmuch as they a re come under the shadow of my roof  9and they said  
stand back  and they said  this one 
fellow came in to sojourn  and he will 
needs play the judge  now will we deal 
worse with thee  than with them  and 
they pressed sore upon the man  even 
lot and d rew near to break the door  
10but the men put forth their hand  and 
brought lot into the house to them  
and the door they shut  11and they 
smote the men that were at the door of 
the house with blindness  both small 
and great  so that they wearied 
themselve s to find the door  12and the 
men said unto lot  hast thou here any 
besides  soninlaw and thy sons  and 
thy daughters  and whomsoever thou 
hast in the city  bring them out of the 
place  13for we will destroy this place  
because the cry of them is waxed  great 
before the lord and the lord hath 
sent us to destroy it  14and lot went 
out and spoke unto his sons inlaw 
who married his daughters  and said  
up get you out of this place  for the 
lord will destroy the city  but he 
seemed unto his sons inlaw as one 
that jested  15and when the morning 
arose  then the angels hastened lot  
saying  arise  take thy wife  and thy 
two daughters that are here  lest thou 
be swept away in the iniquity of the 
city 16but he lingered  and the men 
laid hold upon his h and and upon the 
hand of his wife  and upon the hand of 
his two daughters  the lord being 
merciful unto him  and they brought 
him forth  and set him without the city  
17and it came to pass  when they had 19 genesis  
23 
 brought them forth abroad  that he 
said escape fo r thy life  look not 
behind thee  neither stay thou in all the 
plain  escape to the mountain  lest thou 
be swept away  18and lot said unto 
them  oh not so  my lord  19behold 
now thy servant hath found grace in 
thy sight  and thou hast magnified thy 
mercy which thou hast shown unto me 
in saving my life  and i cannot escape 
to the mountain  lest the evil overtake 
me and i die  20behold now  this city 
is near to flee unto  and it is a little 
one oh let me escape thither is it 
not a little one and my s oul shall 
live 21and he said unto him  see i 
have accepted thee concerning this 
thing also  that i will not overthrow the 
city of which thou hast spoken  
22hasten thou  escape thither  for i 
cannot do any thing till thou be come 
thither therefore the  name of the 
city was called azoar  23the sun was 
risen upon the earth when lot came 
unto zoar  24then the lord caused to 
rain upon sodom and upon gomorrah 
brimstone and fire from the lord out 
of heaven  25and he overthrow those 
cities  and all the plain  and all the 
inhabitants of the cities  and that which 
grew upon the ground  26but his wife 
looked back from behind him  and she 
became a pillar of salt  27and abraham 
got up early in the morning to the 
place where he had stood before the 
lord 28and he lo oked out toward 
sodom and gomorrah  and toward all 
                                                      
a that is little  see verse 20  the land of the plain  and beheld  and 
lo the smoke of the land went up as 
the smoke of a furnace   
29and it came to pass  when god 
destroyed the cities of the plain  that 
god remembered abraham  and sen t 
lot out of the midst of the overthrow  
when he overthrew the cities in which 
lot dwelt   
30and lot went up out of zoar  and 
dwelt in the mountain  and his two 
daughters with him  for he feared to 
dwell in zoar  and he dwelt in a cave  
he and his two daug hters  31and the 
firstborn said unto the younger  our 
father is old  and there is not a man in 
the earth to come in unto us after the 
manner of all the earth  32come  let us 
make our father drink wine  and we 
will lie with him  that we may preserve 
seed of our father  33and they made 
their father drink wine that night  and 
the first born went in  and lay with her 
father  and he knew not when she lay 
down  nor when she arose  34and it 
came to pass on the morrow  that the 
firstborn said unto the younger  
behold  i lay yesternight with my 
father  let us make him drink wine 
this night also  and go thou in  and lie 
with him  that we may preserve seed 
of our father  35and they made their 
father drink wine that night also  and 
the younger arose  and lay with him 
and he knew not when she lay down  
nor when she arose  36thus were both 
the daughters of lot with child by their 
father  37and the first born bore a son  
and called his name moab the same genesis  
24 
 is the father of the moabites unto this 
day 38and the younger  she also bore 
a son  and called his name ben 
ammi the same is the father of the 
children of ammon unto this day   
and abraham journeyed from 
thence toward the land of the 
south  and dwelt between kadesh and 
shur  and he sojourned in gerar  2and 
abraham  said of sarah his wife  she 
is my sister  and abimelech king of 
gerar sent  and took sarah  3but god 
came to abimelech in a dream of the 
night  and said to him  behold  thou 
shalt die  because of the woman whom 
thou hast taken  for she is a man s 
wife 4now abimelech had not come 
near her  and he said  lord  wilt thou 
slay even a righteous nation  5said he 
not himself unto me  she is my sister  
and she  even she herself said  he is 
my brother  in the simplicity of my 
heart and the innocency of my hand s 
have i done this  6and god said unto 
him in the dream  yea i know that in 
the simplicity of thy heart thou hast 
done this  and i also withheld thee 
from sinning against me  therefore 
suffered i thee not to touch her  7now 
therefore restore the man s wife for he 
is a prophet  and he shall pray for thee  
and thou shalt live  and if thou restore 
her not  know thou that thou shalt 
surely die  thou and all that are thine  
8and abimelech rose early in the 
morning  and called all his servants  
and told all  these things in their ears  
and the men were sore afraid  9then 
abimelech called abraham  and said unto him  what hast thou done unto 
us and wherein have i sinned against 
thee that thou hast brought on me and 
on my kingdom a great sin  thou hast 
done d eeds unto me that ought not to 
be done  10and abimelech said unto 
abraham  what sawest thou  that 
thou hast done this thing  11and 
abraham said  because i thought  
surely the fear of god is not in this 
place  and they will slay me for my 
wifes sake  12and moreover she is 
indeed my sister  the daughter of my 
father  but not the daughter of my 
mother  and so she became my wife  
13and it came to pass  when god 
caused me to wander from my father s 
house  that i said unto her  this is thy 
kindness which tho u shalt show unto 
me at every place whither we shall 
come  say of me  he is my brother  
14and abimelech took sheep and oxen  
and men servants and women 
servants  and gave them unto 
abraham  and restored him sarah his 
wife 15and abimelech said  behold  
my land is before thee  dwell where it 
pleaseth thee  16and unto sarah he 
said behold  i have given thy brother 
a thousand pieces of silver  behold  it 
is for thee a covering of the eyes to all 
that are with thee  and before all men 
thou art righted  17and abraham 
prayed unto god  and god healed 
abimelech  and his wife  and his 
maid servants  and they bore children  
18for the lord had fast closed up all 
the wombs of the house of abimelech  
because of sarah abraham s wife   20 genesis  
25 
 and the lord remembered 
sarah as he had said  and the 
lord did unto sarah as he had spoken  
2and sarah conceived  and bore 
abraham a son in his old age  at the 
set time of which god had spoken to 
him 3and abraham called the name of 
his son that was born unto him  whom 
sarah bore to  him isaac  4and 
abraham circumcised his son isaac 
when he was eight days old  as god 
had commanded him  5and abraham 
was a hundred years old  when his son 
isaac was born unto him  6and sarah 
said god hath made laughter for me  
every one that heareth wi ll laugh on 
account of me  7and she said  who 
would have said unto abraham  that 
sarah should give children suck  for i 
have borne him a son in his old age   
8and the child grew  and was 
weaned  and abraham made a great 
feast on the day that isaac was 
weaned  9and sarah saw the son of 
hagar the egyptian  whom she had 
borne unto abraham  making sport  
10wherefore she said unto abraham  
cast out this bondwoman and her son  
for the son of this bondwoman shall 
not be heir with my son  even with 
isaac  11and the thing was very 
grievous in abraham s sight on 
account of his son  12and god said 
unto abraham  let it not be grievous 
in thy sight because of the lad  and 
because of thy bondwoman  in all that 
sarah saith unto thee  hearken unto her 
voice  for in is aac shall seed be called 
to thee  13and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation  
because he is thy seed  14and 
abraham arose up early in the 
morning  and took bread and a bottle 
of water  and gave it unto hagar  
putting it on her shoulder  and the 
child  and sent her away  and she 
departed  and strayed in the wilderness 
of beer sheba  15and the water in the 
bottle was spent  and she cast the child 
under one of the shrubs  16and she 
went  and sat her down over against 
him a good way off  as it were a bow 
shot for she said  let me not look 
upon the death of the child  and she 
sat over against him  and lifted up her 
voice  and wept  17and god heard the 
voice of the lad  and the angel of god 
called to hagar out of heaven  and said 
unto her  what aileth thee  hagar  
fear not  for god hath heard the voice 
of the lad where he is  18arise  lift up 
the lad  and hold him fast by thy hand  
for i will make him a great nation  
19and god opened her eyes  and she 
saw a well of water  and she went  and 
filled the bottle with water  and gave 
the lad drink  20and god was with the 
lad and he grew  and he dwelt in the 
wilderness  and became an archer  
21and he dwelt in the wilderness of 
paran  and his mother took him a wife 
out of the land of egypt   
22and it  came to pass at that time  
that abimelech and phicol the captain 
of his host spoke unto abraham  
saying  god is with thee in all that 
thou doest  23now therefore swear unto 
me here by god that thou wilt not deal 21 genesis

 falsely with me  nor with my son  nor 
with my son s son  but according to 
the kindness that i have done unto 
thee thou shalt do unto me  and to the 
land wherein thou hast sojourned  
24and abraham said  i will swear  
25and abraham reproved abimelech 
because of the well of water  which 
abimelech s servants had violently 
taken away  26and abimelech said  i 
know not who hath done this thing  
neither didst thou tell me  neither yet 
heard i of it  but to day 27and 
abraham took sheep and oxen  and 
gave them unto abimelech  and they 
two made a coven ant 28and abraham 
set seven ewe lambs of the flock by 
themselves  29and abimelech said 
unto abraham  what mean these 
seven ewe lambs which thou hast set 
by themselves  30and he said  
verily  these seven ewe lambs shalt 
thou take of my hand  that it may  be a 
witness unto me  that i have digged 
this well  31wherefore that place was 
called beer sheba  because there they 
swore both of them  32so they made a 
covenant at beer sheba  and 
abimelech rose up  and phicol the 
captain of his host  and they returned  
into the land of the philistines  33and 
abraham planted a tamarisk tree in 
beer sheba  and called there on the 
name of the lord the everlasting 
god 34and abraham sojourned in the 
land of the philistines many days   
and it came to pass after these 
things that god did prove 
abraham  and said unto him  abraham  and he said  here am i  
2and he said  take now thy son  
thine only son  whom thou lovest  
even isaac  and get thee into the land 
of moriah  and offer him there for a 
burnt offering upon one of the 
mountains which i will tell thee of  
3and abraham rose early in the 
morning  and saddled his ass  and took 
two of his young men with him  and 
isaac his son  and he cleaved the wood 
for the burnt offering  and rose up  and 
went unto the place of whi ch god had 
told him  4on the third day abraham 
lifted up his eyes  and saw the place 
afar off  5and abraham said unto his 
young men  abide ye here with the 
ass and i and the lad will go yonder  
and we will worship  and come back to 
you 6and abraham too k the wood of 
the burnt offering  and laid it upon 
isaac his son  and he took in his hand 
the fire and the knife  and they went 
both of them together  7and isaac 
spoke unto abraham his father  and 
said my father  and he said  here 
am i  my son  and he  said behold 
the fire and the wood  but where is the 
lamb for a burnt offering  8and 
abraham said  god will aprovide 
himself the lamb for a burnt offering  
my son  so they went both of them 
together  9and they came to the place 
which god had told him of and 
abraham built the altar there  and laid 
the wood in order  and bound isaac his 
son and laid him on the altar  upon the 
                                                      
a heb jireh  that is see for himself  22 genesis  
27 
 wood  10and abraham stretched forth 
his hand  and took the knife to slay his 
son 11and the angel of the lord called 
unto him ou t of heaven  and said  
abraham  abraham  and he said  
here am i  12and he said  lay not 
thy hand upon the lad  neither do thou 
any thing unto him  for now i know 
that thou art a god fearing man  seeing 
thou hast not withheld thy son  thine 
only son  from me  13and abraham 
lifted up his eyes  and looked  and 
behold behind him a ram caught in the 
thicket by his horns  and abraham 
went and took the ram  and offered 
him up for a burnt offering in the stead 
of his son  14and abraham called the 
name of that  place aadonai jireh as it 
is said to this day  in the mount where 
the lord is seen  15and the angel of 
the lord called unto abraham a 
second time out of heaven  16and said  
by myself have i sworn  saith the 
lord because thou hast done this 
thing  and hast not withheld thy son  
thine only son  17that in blessing i will 
bless thee  and in multiplying i will 
multiply thy seed as the stars of the 
heaven  and as the sand which is upon 
the seashore  and thy seed shall 
possess the gate of his enemies  18and 
in thy seed shall all the nations of the 
earth be blessed  because thou hast 
hearkened to my voice  19so abraham 
returned unto his young men  and they 
rose up and went together to beer 
                                                      
a that is the lord seeth sheba  and abraham dwelt at beer 
sheba   
20and it came to pass after t hese 
things  that it was told abraham  
saying  behold  milcah  she also hath 
borne children unto thy brother nahor  
21uz his first born and buz his 
brother  and kemuel the father of 
aram  22and chesed  and hazo  and 
pildash  and jidlaph  and bethuel  
23and bethuel begot rebekah  these 
eight did milcah bear to nahor  
abraham s brother  24and his 
concubine  whose name was reumah  
she also bore tebah  and gaham  and 
tahash  and maacah   
   
and the life of sarah was a 
hundred and seven and twenty 
years these were the years of the life 
of sarah  2and sarah died in 
kiriatharba the same is hebron in 
the land of canaan  and abraham 
came to mourn for sarah  and to weep 
for her  3and abraham rose up from 
before his dead  and spoke unto the 
children of heth  saying  4i am a 
stranger and a sojourner with you  give 
me a possession of a burying place 
with you  that i may bury my dead out 
of my sight  5and the children of heth 
answered abraham  saying unto him  
6hear us  my lord  thou art a mighty 
prince amon g us in the choice of our 
sepulchres bury thy dead  none of us 
shall withhold from thee his sepulchre  
but that thou mayest bury thy dead  
7and abraham rose up  and bowed 
down to the people of the land  even to 23 genesis  
28 
 the children of heth  8and he spoke 
with th em saying  if it be your mind 
that i should bury my dead out of my 
sight  hear me  and entreat for me to 
ephron the son of zohar  9that he may 
give me the cave of machpelah  which 
he hath  which is in the end of his 
field for the full price let him give  it 
to me in the midst of you for a 
possession of a burying place  10now 
ephron was sitting in the midst of the 
children of heth  and ephron the 
hittite answered abraham in the 
hearing of the children of heth  even 
of all that went in at the gate of his 
city saying  11nay my lord  hear me  
the field give i thee  and the cave that 
is therein  i give it thee  in the 
presence of the sons of my people give 
i it thee  bury thy dead  12and 
abraham bowed down before the 
people of the land  13and he spoke 
unto ephron in the hearing of the 
people of the land  saying  but if thou 
wilt i pray thee  hear me  i will give 
the price of the field  take it of me  and 
i will bury my dead there  14and 
ephron answered abraham  saying 
unto him  15my lord  hearken unto 
me a piece of land worth four hundred 
shekels of silver  what is that betwixt 
me and thee  bury therefore thy dead  
16and abraham hearkened unto 
ephron  and abraham weighed to 
ephron the silver  which he had named 
in the hearing of the children of heth  
four hundred shekels of silver  current 
money with the merchant  17so the 
field of ephron  which was in machpelah  which was before mamre  
the field  and the cave which was 
therein  and all the trees that were in 
the field  that were in all the border 
there of round about  were made 
sure18unto abraham for a possession 
in the presence of the children of heth  
before all that went in at the gate of his 
city 19and after this  abraham buried 
sarah his wife in the cave of the field 
of machpelah before mamre the 
same is hebron in the land of 
canaan  20and the field  and the cave 
that is therein  were made sure unto 
abraham for a possession of a 
burying place by the children of heth   
and abraham was old  well 
stricken in age  and the lord 
had blessed abraham in all things  
2and abraham said unto his servant  
the elder of his house  that ruled over 
all that he had  put i pray thee  thy 
hand under my thigh  3and i will make 
thee swear by the lord the god of 
heaven and the god of the earth  that 
thou shalt not ta ke a wife for my son 
of the daughters of the canaanites  
among whom i dwell  4but thou shalt 
go unto my country  and to my 
kindred  and take a wife for my son  
even for isaac  5and the servant said 
unto him  peradventure the woman 
will not be willing to follow me unto 
this land  must i needs bring thy son 
back unto the land from whence thou 
camest  6and abraham said unto 
him beware thou that thou bring not 
my son back thither  7the lord the 
god of heaven  who took me from my 24 genesis  
29 
 father s house  and from t he land of 
my nativity  and who spoke unto me  
and who swore unto me  saying  unto 
thy seed will i give this land  he will 
send his angel before thee  and thou 
shalt take a wife for my son from 
thence  8and if the woman be not 
willing to follow thee  then thou shalt 
be clear from this my oath  only thou 
shalt not bring my son back thither  
9and the servant put his hand under 
the thigh of abraham his master  and 
swore to him concerning this matter  
10and the servant took ten camels  of 
the camels of his mas ter and departed  
having all goodly things of his 
master s in his hand  and he arose  and 
went to aaram naharaim  unto the city 
of nahor  11and he made the camels to 
kneel down without the city by the 
well of water at the time of evening  
the time that wo men go out to draw 
water  12and he said  o lord the god 
of my master abraham  send me  i 
pray thee  good speed this day  and 
show kindness unto my master 
abraham  13behold  i stand by the 
fountain of water  and the daughters of 
the men of the city come o ut to draw 
water  14so let it come to pass  that the 
damsel to whom i shall say  let down 
thy pitcher  i pray thee  that i may 
drink  and she shall say  drink  and i 
will give thy camels drink also  let the 
same be she that thou hast appointed 
for thy serv ant even for isaac  and 
thereby shall i know that thou hast 
                                                      
a that is mesopotamia  shown kindness unto my master  
15and it came to pass  before he had 
done speaking  that behold  rebekah 
came out  who was born to bethuel the 
son of milcah  the wife of nahor  
abraham s brother  with her pitcher 
upon her shoulder  16and the damsel 
was very fair to look upon  a virgin  
neither had any man known her  and 
she went down to the fountain  and 
filled her pitcher  and came up  17and 
the servant ran to meet her  and said  
give me to dri nk i pray thee  a little 
water of thy pitcher  18and she said  
drink  my lord  and she hastened  
and let down her pitcher upon her 
hand  and gave him drink  19and when 
she had done giving him drink  she 
said i will draw for thy camels also  
until the y have done drinking  20and 
she hastened  and emptied her pitcher 
into the trough  and ran again unto the 
well to draw  and drew for all his 
camels  21and the man looked 
stedfastly on her  holding his peace  to 
know whether the lord had made his 
journey p rosperous or not  22and it 
came to pass  as the camels had done 
drinking  that the man took a golden 
ring of half a shekel weight  and two 
bracelets for her hands of ten shekels 
weight of gold  23and said  whose 
daughter art thou  tell me  i pray thee  
is there room in thy father s house for 
us to lodge in  24and she said unto 
him i am the daughter of bethuel the 
son of milcah  whom she bore unto 
nahor  25she said moreover unto him  
we have both straw and provender genesis  
30 
 enough  and room to lodge in  26and 
the man bowed his head  and 
prostrated himself before the lord 
27and he said  blessed be the lord 
the god of my master abraham  who 
hath not forsaken his mercy and his 
truth toward my master  as for me  the 
lord hath led me in the way to the 
house of m y master s brethren  28and 
the damsel ran  and told her mother s 
house according to these words  29and 
rebekah had a brother  and his name 
was laban  and laban ran out unto the 
man unto the fountain  30and it came 
to pass  when he saw the ring  and the 
bracelets upon his sister s hands  and 
when he heard the words of rebekah 
his sister  saying  thus spoke the man 
unto me  that he came unto the man  
and behold  he stood by the camels at 
the fountain  31and he said  come in  
thou blessed of the lord wherefore 
standest thou without  for i have 
cleared the house  and made room for 
the camels  32and the man came into 
the house  and he ungirded the camels  
and he gave straw and provender for 
the camels  and water to wash his feet 
and the feet of the men th at were with 
him 33and there was set food before 
him to eat  but he said  i will not eat  
until i have told mine errand  and he 
said speak on  34and he said  i am 
abraham s servant  35and the lord 
hath blessed my master greatly  and he 
is become gre at and he hath given 
him flocks and herds  and silver and 
gold and men servants and maid 
servants  and camels and asses  36and sarah my master s wife bore a son to 
my master when she was old  and unto 
him hath he given all that he hath  
37and my master m ade me swear  
saying  thou shalt not take a wife for 
my son of the daughters of the 
canaanites  in whose land i dwell  
38but thou shalt go unto my father s 
house  and to my kindred  and take a 
wife for my son  39and i said unto my 
master  peradventure the woman will 
not follow me  40and he said unto me  
the lord before whom i walk  will 
send his angel with thee  and prosper 
thy way  and thou shalt take a wife for 
my son of my kindred  and of my 
father s house  41then shalt thou be 
clear from my oath  when thou comest 
to my kindred  and if they give her not 
to thee  thou shalt be clear from my 
oath 42and i came this day unto the 
fountain  and said  o lord the god of 
my master abraham  if now thou do 
prosper my way which i go  43behold  i 
stand by the fount ain of water  and let 
it come to pass  that the maiden that 
cometh forth to draw  to whom i shall 
say give me  i pray thee  a little water 
from thy pitcher to drink  44and she 
shall say to me  both drink thou  and i 
will also draw for thy camels  let the 
same be the woman whom the lord 
hath appointed for my master s son  
45and before i had done speaking to 
my heart  behold  rebekah came forth 
with her pitcher on her shoulder  and 
she went down unto the fountain  and 
drew  and i said unto her  let me 
drink  i pray thee  46and she made genesis  
31 
 haste  and let down her pitcher from 
her shoulder  and said  drink  and i 
will give thy camels drink also  so i 
drank  and she made the camels drink 
also 47and i asked her  and said  
whose daughter art thou  and she 
said the daughter of bethuel  nahor s 
son whom milcah bore unto him  and 
i put the ring upon her nose  and the 
bracelets upon her hands  48and i 
bowed my head  and prostrated myself 
before the lord and blessed the lord 
the god of my master abraham  who 
had led m e in the right way to take my 
master s brother s daughter for his 
son 49and now if ye will deal kindly 
and truly with my master  tell me  and 
if not  tell me  that i may turn to the 
right hand  or to the left  50then 
laban and bethuel answered and said  
the thing proceedeth from the lord 
we cannot speak unto thee bad or 
good  51behold  rebekah is before 
thee take her  and go  and let her be 
thy master s son s wife  as the lord 
hath spoken  52and it came to pass  
that when abraham s servant heard 
their words  he bowed himself down to 
the earth unto the lord 53and the 
servant brought forth jewels of silver  
and jewels of gold  and raiment  and 
gave them to rebekah  he gave also to 
her brother and to her mother precious 
things  54and they did eat and dr ink 
he and the men that were with him  
and tarried all night  and they rose up 
in the morning  and he said  send me 
away unto my master  55and her 
brother and her mother said  let the damsel abide with us a few days  at the 
least ten  after that she sh all go  56and 
he said unto them  delay me not  
seeing the lord hath prospered my 
way send me away that i may go to 
my master  57and they said  we will 
call the damsel  and inquire at her 
mouth  58and they called rebekah  
and said unto her  wilt thou  go with 
this man  and she said  i will go  
59and they sent away rebekah their 
sister  and her nurse  and abraham s 
servant  and his men  60and they 
blessed rebekah  and said unto her  
our sister  be thou the mother of 
thousands of ten thousands  and l et thy 
seed possess the gate of those that hate 
them  61and rebekah arose  and her 
damsels  and they rode upon the 
camels  and followed the man  and the 
servant took rebekah  and went his 
way 62and isaac came from the way 
of beer lahai roi for he dwelt in the 
land of the south  63and isaac went 
out to meditate in the field at the 
eventide  and he lifted up his eyes  and 
saw and behold  there were camels 
coming  64and rebekah lifted up her 
eyes and when she saw isaac  she 
alighted from the camel  65and she 
said unto the servant  what man is 
this that walketh in the field to meet 
us and the servant said  it is my 
master  and she took her veil  and 
covered herself  66and the servant told 
isaac all the things that he had done  
67and isaac brought her into his 
mother sarah s tent  and took 
rebekah  and she became his wife  genesis  
32 
 and he loved her  and isaac was 
comforted for his mother   
and abraham took another 
wife and her name was 
keturah  2and she bore him zimran  
and jokshan  and medan  and midian  
and ishbak  and shuah  3and jokshan 
begot sheba  and dedan  and the sons 
of dedan were asshurim  and 
letushim  and leummim  4and the 
sons of midian  ephah  and epher  and 
hanoch  and abida  and eldaah  all 
these were the children of keturah  
5and abraham gav e all that he had 
unto isaac  6but unto the sons of the 
concubines  that abraham had  
abraham gave gifts  and he sent them 
away from isaac his son  while he yet 
lived  eastward  unto the east country  
7and these are the days of the years of 
abraham s life which he lived  a 
hundred threescore and fifteen years  
8and abraham expired  and died in a 
good old age  an old man  and full of 
years  and was gathered to his people  
9and isaac and ishmael his sons buried 
him in the cave of machpelah  in the 
field of ep hron the son of zohar the 
hittite  which is before mamre  10the 
field which abraham purchased of the 
children of heth  there was abraham 
buried  and sarah his wife  11and it 
came to pass after the death of 
abraham  that god blessed isaac his 
son and isaac  dwelt by beer lahai roi  
12now these are the generations of 
ishmael  abraham s son  whom hagar 
the egyptian  sarah s handmaid  bore 
unto abraham  13and these are the names of the sons of ishmael  by their 
names  according to their generations  
the first born of ishmael  nebaioth  
and kedar  and adbeel  and mibsam  
14and mishma  and dumah  and 
massa  15hadad  and tema  jetur  
naphish  and kedem  16these are the 
sons of ishmael  and these are their 
names  by their villages  and by their 
encampments  twelve princes 
according to their nations  17and these 
are the years of the life of ishmael  a 
hundred and thirty and seven years  
and he expired and died  and was 
gathered unto his people  18and they 
dwelt from havilah unto shur that is 
before egypt  as thou goe st toward 
asshur  over against all his brethren he 
did settle   
  
19and these are the generations of 
isaac  abraham s son  abraham begot 
isaac  20and isaac was forty years old 
when he took rebekah  the daughter of 
bethuel the aramean  of paddan aram  
the sister of laban the aramean  to be 
his wife  21and isaac entr eated the 
lord for his wife  because she was 
barren  and the lord let himself be 
entreated of him  and rebekah his wife 
conceived  22and the children 
struggled together within her  and she 
said if it be so  wherefore do i live  
and she went to inquire o f the lord 
23and the lord said unto her   
two nations are in thy womb   
and two peoples shall be separated 
from thy bowels   25 genesis  
33 
 and the one people shall be stronger 
than the other people   
and the elder shall serve the 
younger   
24and when her days to be del ivered 
were fulfilled  behold  there were 
twins in her womb  25and the first 
came forth ruddy  all over like a hairy 
mantle  and they called his name esau  
26and after that came forth his brother  
and his hand had hold on esau s heel  
and his name was call ed ajacob  and 
isaac was threescore years old when 
she bore them  27and the boys grew  
and esau was a cunning hunter  a man 
of the field  and jacob was a quiet 
man dwelling in tents  28now isaac 
loved esau  because he did eat of his 
venison  and rebekah l oved jacob  
29and jacob sod pottage  and esau 
came in from the field  and he was 
faint 30and esau said to jacob  let 
me swallow  i pray thee  some of this 
red red pottage  for i am faint  
therefore was his name called bedom  
31and jacob said  sell me first thy 
birth right  32and esau said  behold  
i am at the point to die  and what profit 
shall the birthright do to me  33and 
jacob said  swear to me first  and he 
swore unto him  and he sold his 
birthright unto jacob  34and jacob 
gave esau bread and  pottage of lentils  
and he did eat and drink  and rose up  
                                                      
a that is one that takes by the heel 
or supplants  
b that is red and went his way  so esau despised 
his birthright   
and there was a famine in the 
land beside the first famine 
that was in the days of abraham  and 
isaac went unto abimelech king of the 
philis tines unto gerar  2and the lord 
appeared unto him  and said  go not 
down unto egypt  dwell in the land 
which i shall tell thee of  3sojourn in 
this land  and i will be with thee  and 
will bless thee  for unto thee  and unto 
thy seed  i will give all these  lands  
and i will establish the oath which i 
swore unto abraham thy father  4and i 
will multiply thy seed as the stars of 
heaven  and will give unto thy seed all 
these lands  and by thy seed shall all 
the nations of the earth bless 
themselves  5because th at abraham 
hearkened to my voice  and kept my 
charge  my commandments  my 
statutes  and my laws  6and isaac 
dwelt in gerar  7and the men of the 
place asked him of his wife  and he 
said she is my sister  for he feared 
to say  my wife  lest the men of  the 
place should kill me for rebekah  
because she is fair to look upon  8and 
it came to pass  when he had been 
there a long time  that abimelech king 
of the philistines looked out at a 
window  and saw  and behold  isaac 
was sporting with rebekah his wif e 
9and abimelech called isaac  and said  
behold  of a surety she is thy wife  
and how saidst thou  she is my sister  
and isaac said unto him  because i 
said lest i die because of her  10and 26 genesis  
34 
 abimelech said  what is this thou 
hast done unto us  one of  the people 
might easily have lain with thy wife  
and thou wouldest have brought 
guiltiness upon us  11and abimelech 
charged all the people  saying  he that 
toucheth this man or his wife shall 
surely be put to death  12and isaac 
sowed in that land  and found in the 
same year a hundred fold and the 
lord blessed him  13and the man 
waxed great  and grew more and more 
until he became very great  14and he 
had possessions of flocks  and 
possessions of herds  and a great 
household  and the philistines envied 
him 15now all the wells which his 
father s servants had digged in the 
days of abraham his father  the 
philistines had stopped them  and 
filled them with earth  16and 
abimelech said unto isaac  go from 
us for thou art much mightier than 
we 17and isaac d eparted thence  and 
encamped in the valley of gerar  and 
dwelt there  18and isaac digged again 
the wells of water  which they had 
digged in the days of abraham his 
father  for the philistines had stopped 
them after the death of abraham  and 
he called their  names after the names 
by which his father had called them  
19and isaac s servants digged in the 
valley  and found there a well of living 
water  20and the herdmen of gerar 
strove with isaac s herdmen  saying  
the water is ours  and he called the name of the well aesek  because they 
contended with him  21and they 
digged another well  and they strove 
for that also  and he called the name 
of it bsitnah  22and he removed from 
thence  and digged another well  and 
for that they strove not  and he called 
the nam e of it crehoboth  and he said  
for now the lord hath made room for 
us and we shall be fruitful in the 
land 23and he went up from thence to 
beer sheba  24and the lord appeared 
unto him the same night  and said  i 
am the god of abraham thy father  
fear not for i am with thee  and will 
bless thee  and multiply thy seed for 
my servant abraham s sake  25and he 
builded an altar there  and called upon 
the name of the lord and pitched his 
tent there  and there isaac s servants 
digged a well  26then abimele ch went 
to him from gerar  and ahuzzath his 
friend  and phicol the captain of his 
host 27and isaac said unto them  
wherefore are ye come unto me  
seeing ye hate me  and have sent me 
away from you  28and they said  we 
saw plainly that the lord was with 
thee and we said  let there now be an 
oath betwixt us  even betwixt us and 
thee and let us make a covenant with 
thee 29that thou wilt do us no hurt  as 
we have not touched thee  and as we 
have done unto thee nothing but good  
and have sent thee away in peace  thou 
                                                      
a that is contention  
b that is enmity  
c that is room  genesis  
35 
 art now the blessed of the lord 
30and he made them a feast  and they 
did eat and drink  31and they rose up 
betimes in the morning  and swore one 
to another  and isaac sent them away  
and they departed from him in peace  
32and it came to pass the same day  
that isaac s servants came  and told 
him concerning the well which they 
had digged  and said unto him  we 
have found water  33and he called it 
shibah  therefore the name of the city 
is beer sheba unto this day   
34and when esau was forty ye ars 
old he took to wife judith the 
daughter of beeri the hittite  and 
basemath the daughter of elon the 
hittite  35and they were a bitterness of 
spirit unto isaac and to rebekah   
and it came to pass  that when 
isaac was old  and his eyes 
were dim  so that he could not see  he 
called esau his elder son  and said 
unto him  my son  and he said unto 
him here am i  2and he said  
behold now  i am old  i know not the 
day of my death  3now therefore take  
i pray thee  thy weapons  thy quiver 
and thy bow  and go out to the field  
and take me venison  4and make me 
savoury food  such as i love  and bring 
it to me  that i may eat  that my soul 
may bless thee before i die  5and 
rebekah heard when isaac spoke to 
esau his son  and esau went to the 
field to hunt  for venison  and to bring 
it 6and rebekah spoke unto jacob her 
son saying  behold  i heard thy father 
speak unto esau thy brother  saying  7bring me venison  and make me 
savoury food  that i may eat  and bless 
thee before the lord before my death  
8now  therefore  my son  hearken to 
my voice according to that which i 
command thee  9go now to the flock  
and fetch me from thence two good 
kids of the goats  and i will make them 
savoury food for thy father  such as he 
loveth  10and thou shalt bring it to thy  
father  that he may eat  so that he may 
bless thee before his death  11and 
jacob said to rebekah his mother  
behold  esau my brother is a hairy 
man and i am a smooth man  12my 
father peradventure will feel me  and i 
shall seem to him as a mocker  and i  
shall bring a curse upon me  and not a 
blessing  13and his mother said unto 
him upon me be thy curse  my son  
only hearken to my voice  and go fetch 
me them  14and he went  and fetched  
and brought them to his mother  and 
his mother made savoury food  such as 
his father loved  15and rebekah took 
the choicest garments of esau her 
elder son  which were with her in the 
house  and put them upon jacob her 
younger son  16and she put the skins 
of the kids of the goats upon his hands  
and upon the smooth of hi s neck  
17and she gave the savoury food and 
the bread  which she had prepared  
into the hand of her son jacob  18and 
he came unto his father  and said  my 
father  and he said  here am i  who 
art thou  my son  19and jacob said 
unto his father  i am esa u thy first 
born i have done according as thou 27 genesis  
36 
 badest me  arise  i pray thee  sit and 
eat of my venison  that thy soul may 
bless me  20and isaac said unto his 
son how is it that thou hast found it 
so quickly  my son  and he said  
because the lord thy god sent me 
good speed  21and isaac said unto 
jacob  come near  i pray thee  that i 
may feel thee  my son  whether thou 
be my very son esau or not  22and 
jacob went near unto isaac his father  
and he felt him  and said  the voice is 
the voice of jacob  but the hands are 
the hands of esau  23and he discerned 
him not  because his hands were hairy  
as his brother esau s hands  so he 
blessed him  24and he said  art thou 
my very son esau  and he said  i 
am 25and he said  bring it near to 
me and i wi ll eat of my son s venison  
that my soul may bless thee  and he 
brought it near to him  and he did eat  
and he brought him wine  and he 
drank  26and his father isaac said unto 
him come near now  and kiss me  
my son  27and he came near  and 
kissed him  and he smelled the smell 
of his raiment  and blessed him  and 
said  
see the smell of my son  
is as the smell of a field which the 
lord hath blessed   
28so god give thee of the dew of 
heaven   
and of the fat places of the earth   
and plenty of corn and wi ne  
29let peoples serve thee   
and nations bow down to thee   
be lord over thy brethren   and let thy mother s sons bow 
down to thee   
cursed be every one that curseth 
thee  
and blessed be every one that 
blesseth thee   
30and it came to pass  as soon as isaac 
had made an end of blessing jacob  
and jacob was yet scarce gone out 
from the presence of isaac his father  
that esau his brother came in from his 
hunting  31and he also made savoury 
food and brought it unto his father  
and he said unto his father  let my 
father arise  and eat of his son s 
venison  that thy soul may bless me  
32and isaac his father said unto him  
who art thou  and he said  i am thy 
son thy first born esau  33and isaac 
trembled very exceedingly  and said  
who then is he that hath taken 
venison  and brought it me  and i have 
eaten of all before thou camest  and 
have blessed him  yea and he shall be 
blessed  34when esau heard the words 
of his father  he cried with an 
exceeding great and bitter cry  and said 
unto his father  bless me  even me 
also o my father  35and he said  thy 
brother came with guile  and hath 
taken away thy blessing  36and he 
said is not he rightly named jacob  
for he hath supplanted me these two 
times  he took away my birthright  
and behold  now he h ath taken away 
my blessing  and he said  hast thou 
not reserved a blessing for me  37and 
isaac answered and said unto esau  
behold  i have made him thy lord  genesis  
37 
 and all his brethren have i given to 
him for servants  and with corn and 
wine have i sustained  him and what 
then shall i do for thee  my son  
38and esau said unto his father  hast 
thou but one blessing  my father  bless 
me even me also  o my father  and 
esau lifted up his voice  and wept  
39and isaac his father answered and 
said unto him   
behold of the fat places of the earth 
shall be thy dwelling   
and of the dew of heaven from 
above   
40and by thy sword shalt thou live   
and thou shalt serve thy brother   
and it shall come to pass when thou 
shalt break loose   
that thou shalt shake his yoke  from 
off thy neck   
41and esau hated jacob because of the 
blessing wherewith his father blessed 
him and esau said in his heart  let 
the days of mourning for my father be 
at hand  then will i slay my brother 
jacob  42and the words of esau her 
elder son were told to rebekah  and 
she sent and called jacob her younger 
son and said unto him  behold  thy 
brother esau  as touching thee  doth 
comfort himself  purposing to kill thee  
43now therefore  my son  hearken to 
my voice  and arise  flee thou to laban 
my brother to haran  44and tarry with 
him a few days  until thy brother s 
fury turn away  45until thy brother s 
anger turn away from thee  and he 
forget that which thou hast done to 
him then i will send  and fetch thee from thence  why should i be bereaved  
of you both in one day   
46and rebekah said to isaac  i am 
weary of my life because of the 
daughters of heth  if jacob take a wife 
of the daughters of heth  such as these  
of the daughters of the land  what good 
shall my life do me   
and isaac calle d jacob  and 
blessed him  and charged him  
and said unto him  thou shalt not take 
a wife of the daughters of canaan  
2arise  go to paddan aram  to the 
house of bethuel thy mother s father  
and take thee a wife from thence of the 
daughters of laban thy mot hers 
brother  3and god almighty bless 
thee and make thee fruitful  and 
multiply thee  that thou mayest be a 
congregation of peoples  4and give 
thee the blessing of abraham  to thee  
and to thy seed with thee  that thou 
mayest inherit the land of thy 
sojournings  which god gave unto 
abraham  5and isaac sent away 
jacob  and he went to paddan aram 
unto laban  son of bethuel the 
aramean  the brother of rebekah  
jacob s and esau s mother  6now esau 
saw that isaac had blessed jacob and 
sent him away to paddan aram  to take 
him a wife from thence  and that as he 
blessed him he gave him a charge  
saying  thou shalt not take a wife of 
the daughters of canaan  7and that 
jacob hearkened to his father and his 
mother  and was gone to paddan aram  
8and esau saw that the daughters of 
canaan pleased not isaac his father  28 genesis  
38 
 9so esau went unto ishmael  and took 
unto the wives that he had mahalath 
the daughter of ishmael abraham s 
son the sister of nebaioth  to be his 
wife  
 
10and jacob went out from beer 
sheba  and we nt toward haran  11and 
he lighted upon the place  and tarried 
there all night  because the sun was 
set and he took one of the stones of 
the place  and put it under his head  
and lay down in that place to sleep  
12and he dreamed  and behold a ladder 
set up  on the earth  and the top of it 
reached to heaven  and behold the 
angels of god ascending and 
descending on it  13and behold  the 
lord stood beside him  and said  i am 
the lord the god of abraham thy 
father  and the god of isaac  the land 
whereon thou liest to thee will i give 
it and to thy seed  14and thy seed shall 
be as the dust of the earth  and thou 
shalt spread abroad to the west  and to 
the east  and to the north  and to the 
south  and in thee and in thy seed 
shall all the families of the earth  be 
blessed  15and behold  i am with thee  
and will keep thee whithersoever thou 
goest  and will bring thee back into 
this land  for i will not leave thee  until 
i have done that which i have spoken 
to thee of  16and jacob awaked out of 
his sleep  and he  said surely the lord 
is in this place  and i knew it not  
17and he was afraid  and said  how 
full of awe is this place  this is none 
other than the house of god  and this is the gate of heaven  18and jacob rose 
up early in the morning  and took the 
stone that he had put under his head  
and set it up for a pillar  and poured oil 
upon the top of it  19and he called the 
name of that place abeth el but the 
name of the city was luz at the first  
20and jacob vowed a vow  saying  if 
god will be with me  and will keep me 
in this way that i go  and will give me 
bread to eat  and raiment to put on  
21so that i come back to my father s 
house in peace  then shall the lord be 
my god  22and this stone  which i have 
set up for a pillar  shall be god s 
house  and of  all that thou shalt give 
me i will surely give the tenth unto 
thee   
then jacob went on his 
journey  and came to the land 
of the children of the east  2and he 
looked  and behold a well in the field  
and lo three flocks of sheep lying 
there by it for out of that well they 
watered the flocks  and the stone upon 
the well s mouth was great  3and 
thither were all the flocks gathered  
and they rolled the stone from the 
wells mouth  and watered the sheep  
and put the stone back upon the well s 
mouth in it s place  4and jacob said 
unto them  my brethren  whence are 
ye and they said  of haran are we  
5and he said unto them  know ye 
laban the son of nahor  and they 
said we know him  6and he said 
unto them  is it well with him  and 
                                                      
a that is the house of god  29 genesis  
39 
 they said  it is well  and behold  
rachel his daughter cometh with the 
sheep  7and he said  lo it is yet high 
day neither is it time that the cattle 
should be gathered together  water ye 
the sheep  and go and feed them  
8and they said  we cannot  until all 
the flo cks be gathered together  and 
they roll the stone from the well s 
mouth  then we water the sheep  
9while he was yet speaking with them  
rachel came with her father s sheep  
for she tended them  10and it came to 
pass when jacob saw rachel the 
daughter of laban his mother s 
brother  and the sheep of laban his 
mother s brother  that jacob went near  
and rolled the stone from the well s 
mouth  and watered the flock of laban 
his mother s brother  11and jacob 
kissed rachel  and lifted up his voice  
and wept  12and jacob told rachel that 
he was her father s brother  and that he 
was rebekah s son  and she ran and 
told her father  13and it came to pass  
when laban heard the tidings of jacob 
his sister s son  that he ran to meet 
him and embraced him  and kissed 
him and brought him to his house  
and he told laban all these things  
14and laban said to him  surely thou 
art my bone and my flesh  and he 
abode with him the space of a month  
15and laban said unto jacob  
because thou art my brother  
shouldest thou there fore serve me for 
nought  tell me  what shall thy wages 
be 16now laban had two daughters  
the name of the elder was leah  and the name of the younger was rachel  
17and leah s eyes were weak  but 
rachel was of beautiful form and fair 
to look upon  18and j acob loved 
rachel  and he said  i will serve thee 
seven years for rachel thy younger 
daughter  19and laban said  it is 
better that i give her to thee  than that i 
should give her to another man  abide 
with me  20and jacob served seven 
years for rachel  and they seemed 
unto him but a few days  for the love 
he had to her  21and jacob said unto 
laban  give me my wife  for my days 
are filled  that i may go in unto her  
22and laban gathered together all the 
men of the place  and made a feast  
23and it came  to pass in the evening  
that he took leah his daughter  and 
brought her to him  and he went in 
unto her  24and laban gave zilpah his 
handmaid unto his daughter leah for a 
handmaid  25and it came to pass in the 
morning that  behold  it was leah  and 
he sai d to laban  what is this thou 
hast done unto me  did not i serve 
with thee for rachel  wherefore then 
hast thou beguiled me  26and laban 
said it is not so done in our place  to 
give the younger before the first born 
27fulfil the week of this one  and we 
will give thee the other also for the 
service which thou shalt serve with me 
yet seven other years  28and jacob did 
so and fulfilled her week  and he gave 
him rachel his daughter to wife  29and 
laban gave to rachel his daughter 
bilhah his handmaid to be her 
handmaid  30and he went in also unto genesis  
40 
 rachel  and he loved rachel more than 
leah  and served with him yet seven 
other years   
31and the lord saw that leah was 
hated  and he opened her womb  but 
rachel was barren  32and leah 
conceived  and bore a son  and she 
called his name reuben  for she said  
because the lord ahath looked upon 
my affliction  for now my husband 
will love me  33and she conceived 
again  and bore a son  and said  
because the lord bhath heard that i 
am hated  he hath therefore given me 
this son also  and she called his name 
csimeon  34and she conceived again  
and bore a son  and said  now this 
time will my husband be djoined unto 
me because i have borne him three 
sons therefore was his name called 
levi 35and she conceived again  and 
bore a son  and she said  this time 
will i epraise the lord therefore she 
called his name fjudah  and she left off 
bearing   
and when rachel saw that she 
bore jacob no children  rachel 
envied her sister  and she said unto 
jacob  give me childre n or else i 
die 2and jacob s anger was kindled 
against rachel  and he said  am i in 
gods stead  who hath withheld from

said behold my maid bilhah  go in 
unto her  that she may bear upon my 
knees  and i also may be builded up 
through her  4and she gave him 
bilhah her handmaid to wife  and 
jacob went in unto her  5and bilhah 
conceived  and bore jacob a son  6and 
rachel said  god hath gjudged me  
and hath also heard my voice  and hath 
given me a son  therefore ca lled she 
his name dan  7and bilhah rachel s 
handmaid conceived again  and bore 
jacob a second son  8and rachel said  
with mighty wrestlings have i 
hwrestled with my sister  and have 
prevailed  and she called his name 
naphtali  9when leah saw that she 
had left off bearing  she took zilpah 
her handmaid  and gave her to jacob to 
wife 10and zilpah leah s handmaid 
bore jacob a son  11and leah said  
fortune is come   and she called his 
name igad 12and zilpah leah s 
handmaid bore jacob a second son  
13and le ah said  happy am i  for the 
daughters will call me happy  and she 
called his name jasher  14and reuben 
went in the days of wheat harvest  and 
found mandrakes in the field  and 
brought them unto his mother leah  
then rachel said to leah  give me  i 
pray thee of thy son s mandrakes  
15and she said unto her  is it a small

 matter that thou hast taken away my 
husband  and wouldest thou take away 
my son s mandrakes also  and 
rachel said  therefore he shall lie 
with thee to night for thy son s 
mandrakes  16and jacob came from 
the field in the evening  and leah went 
out to meet him  and said  thou must 
come in unto me  for i have surely 
hired thee with my son s mandrakes  
and he lay with her that night  17and 
god hearkened unto leah  and she 
conceived  and bore jacob a fifth son  
18and leah said  god hath given me 
my ahire because i gave my handmaid 
to my husband  and she called his 
name issachar  19and leah conceived 
again  and bore a sixth son to jacob  
20and leah said  god hath endowed 
me with a goo d dowry  now will my 
husband bdwell with me  because i 
have borne him six sons  and she 
called his name zebulun  21and 
afterwards she bore a daughter  and 
called her name dinah  22and god 
remembered rachel  and god 
hearkened to her  and opened her 
womb  23and she conceived  and bore 
a son  and said  god chath taken away 
my reproach  24and she called his 
name joseph  saying  the lord dadd 
to me another son   
25and it came to pass  when rachel 
had borne joseph  that jacob said unto 
                                                      
a heb sachar

c heb asaph  
d heb joseph  laban  send me away  that i may go 
unto mine own place  and to my 
country  26give me my wives and my 
children for whom i have served thee  
and let me go  for thou knowest my 
service wherewith i have served thee  
27and laban said unto him  if now i 
have found favour in thine eyesi 
have observed the signs  and the lord 
hath blessed me for thy sake  28and 
he said  appoint me thy wages  and i 
will give it  29and he said unto him  
thou knowest how i have served 
thee and how thy cattle have fared 
with me  30for it was little which thou 
hadst before i came  and it hath 
increased abundantly  and the lord 
hath blessed thee whithersoever i 
turned  and now when shall i provide 
for mine own house also  31and he 
said what shall i give thee  and 
jacob said  thou shalt not give me  
aught  if thou wilt do this thing for me  
i will again feed thy flock and keep it  
32i will pass through all thy flock to 
day removing from thence every 
speckled and spotted one  and every 
dark one among the sheep  and the 
spotted and speckled among the goats  
and of such shall be my hire  33so shall 
my righteousness witness against me 
hereafter  when thou shalt come to 
look over my hire that is before thee  
every one that is not speckled and 
spotted among the goats  and dark 
among the sheep  that if foun d with me 
shall be counted stolen  34and laban 
said behold  would it might be 
according to thy word  35and he genesis  
42 
 removed that day the he goats that 
were streaked and spotted  and all the 
shegoats that were speckled and 
spotted  every one that had white i n it 
and all the dark ones among the sheep  
and gave them into the hand of his 
sons 36and he set three days journey 
betwixt himself and jacob  and jacob 
fed the rest of laban s flocks  37and 
jacob took him rods of fresh poplar  
and of the almond and of t he plane 
tree and peeled white streaks in them  
making the white appear which was in 
the rods  38and he set the rods which 
he had peeled over against the flocks 
in the gutters in the watering troughs 
where the flocks came to drink  and 
they conceived when  they came to 
drink  39and the flocks conceived at 
the sight of the rods  and the flocks 
brought forth streaked  speckled  and 
spotted  40and jacob separated the 
lambs he also set the faces of the 
flocks toward the streaked and all the 
dark in the flock of  laban  and put 
his own droves apart  and put them not 
unto laban s flock  41and it came to 
pass whensoever the stronger of the 
flock did conceive  that jacob laid the 
rods before the eyes of the flock in the 
gutters  that they might conceive 
among the ro ds 42but when the flock 
were feeble  he put them not in  so the 
feebler were laban s and the stronger 
jacob s 43and the man increased 
exceedingly  and had large flocks  and 
maid servants and men servants  and 
camels and asses   
and he heard the words  of laban s sons  saying  jacob hath 
taken away all that was our father s 
and of that which was our father s hath 
he gotten all this wealth  2and jacob 
beheld the countenance of laban  and 
behold  it was not toward him as 
beforetime  3and the lord said unto 
jacob  return unto the land of thy 
fathers  and to thy kindred  and i will 
be with thee  4and jacob sent and 
called rachel and leah to the field 
unto his flock  5and said unto them  i 
see your father s countenance  that it is 
not toward me as befo retime  but the 
god of my father hath been with me  
6and ye know that with all my power i 
have served your father  7and your 
father hath mocked me  and changed 
my wages ten times  but god suffered 
him not to hurt me  8if he said thus  
the speckled shall be  thy wages  then 
all the flock bore speckled  and if he 
said thus  the streaked shall be thy 
wages  then bore all the flock streaked  
9thus god hath taken away the cattle 
of your father  and given them to me  
10and it came to pass at the time that 
the floc k conceived  that i lifted up 
mine eyes  and saw in a dream  and 
behold  the he goats which leaped 
upon the flock were streaked  
speckled  and grizzled  11and the angel 
of god said unto me in the dream  
jacob  and i said  here am i  12and he 
said lift up  now thine eyes  and see  
all the he goats which leap upon the 
flock are streaked  speckled  and 
grizzled  for i have seen all that laban 
doeth unto thee  13i am the god of 31 genesis  
43 
 beth el where thou didst anoint a 
pillar  where thou didst vow a vow 
unto me  now arise  get thee out from 
this land  and return unto the land of 
thy nativity  14and rachel and leah 
answered and said unto him  is there 
yet any portion or inheritance for us in 
our father s house  15are we not 
accounted by him strangers  for he 
hath sol d us  and hath also quite 
devoured our price  16for all the riches 
which god hath taken away from our 
father  that is ours and our children s 
now then  whatsoever god hath said 
unto thee  do 17then jacob rose up  
and set his sons and his wives upon the 
camels  18and he carried away all his 
cattle  and all his substance which he 
had gathered  the cattle of his getting  
which he had gathered in paddan 
aram  to go to isaac his father unto the 
land of canaan  19now laban was 
gone to shear his sheep  and rach el 
stole the teraphim that were her 
father s 20and jacob outwitted laban 
the aramean  in that he told him not 
that he fled  21so he fled with all that 
he had  and he rose up  and passed 
over athe river  and set his face toward 
the mountain of gilead   
22and it was told laban on the third 
day that jacob was fled  23and he took 
his brethren with him  and pursued 
after him seven days journey  and he 
overtook him in the mountain of 
gilead  24and god came to laban the 
aramean in a dream of the night  and 
                                                      
a that is the euphrates  said u nto him  take heed to thyself 
that thou speak not to jacob either 
good or bad  25and laban came up 
with jacob  now jacob had pitched his 
tent in the mountain  and laban with 
his brethren pitched in the mountain of 
gilead  26and laban said to jacob  
what  hast thou done  that thou hast 
outwitted me  and carried away my 
daughters as though captives of the 
sword  27wherefore didst thou flee 
secretly  and outwit me  and didst not 
tell me  that i might have sent thee 
away with mirth and with songs  with 
tabret  and with harp  28and didst not 
suffer me to kiss my sons and my 
daughters  now hast thou done 
foolishly  29it is in the power of my 
hand to do you hurt  but the god of 
your father spoke unto me yesternight  
saying  take heed to thyself that thou 
speak not  to jacob either good or bad  
30and now that thou art surely gone  
because thou sore longest after thy 
father s house  wherefore hast thou 
stolen my gods  31and jacob 
answered and said to laban  because 
i was afraid  for i said  lest thou 
shouldest take thy daughters from me 
by force  32with whomsoever thou 
findest thy gods  he shall not live  
before our brethren discern thou what 
is thine with me  and take it to thee 
for jacob knew not that rachel had 
stolen them  33and laban went into 
jacob s tent  and into leah s tent  and 
into the tent of the two maid servants  
but he found them not  and he went 
out of leah s tent  and entered into genesis  
44 
 rachel s tent  34now rachel had taken 
the teraphim  and put them in the 
saddle of the camel  and sat upon 
them  and lab an felt about all the 
tent but found them not  35and she 
said to her father  let not my lord be 
angry that i cannot rise up before thee  
for the manner of women is upon me  
and he searched  but found not the 
teraphim  36and jacob was wroth  and 
strove w ith laban  and jacob 
answered and said to laban  what is 
my trespass  what is my sin  that thou 
hast hotly pursued after me  
37whereas thou hast felt about all my 
stuff what hast thou found of all thy 
household stuff  set it here before my 
brethren and t hy brethren  that they 
may judge betwixt us two  38these 
twenty years have i been with thee  thy 
ewes and thy she goats have not cast 
their young  and the rams of thy flocks 
have i not eaten  39that which was torn 
of beasts i brought not unto thee  i 
bore the loss of it  of my hand didst 
thou require it  whether stolen by day 
or stolen by night  40thus i was  in the 
day the drought consumed me  and the 
frost by night  and my sleep fled from 
mine eyes  41these twenty years have i 
been in thy house  i served thee 
fourteen years for thy two daughters  
and six years for thy flock  and thou 
hast changed my wages ten times  
42except the god of my father  the 
god of abraham  and the fear of 
isaac  had been on my side  surely now 
hadst thou sent me away empty  god 
hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands  and gave 
judgment yesternight  43and laban 
answered and said unto jacob  the 
daughters are my daughters  and the 
children are my children  and the 
flocks are my flocks  and all that thou 
seest is mine  and what can i do this 
day for these my daughters  or for their 
children whom they have borne  
44and now come  let us make a 
covenant  i and thou  and let it be for a 
witness between me and thee  45and 
jacob took a stone  and set it up for a 
pillar  46and jacob said unto his 
brethren  gather stones  and they 
took stones  and made a heap  and 
they did eat there by the heap  47and 
laban called it ajegar sahadutha  but 
jacob called it bgaleed  48and laban 
said this heap is witness between me 
and thee thi s day  therefore was the 
name of it called galeed  49and 
cmizpah  for he said  the lord watch 
between me and thee  when we are 
absent one from another  50if thou shalt 
afflict my daughters  and if thou shalt 
take wives beside my daughters  no 
man being w ith us  see god is witness 
betwixt me and thee  51and laban 
said to jacob  behold this heap  and 
behold the pillar  which i have set up 
betwixt me and thee  52this heap be 
witness  and the pillar be witness  that 
                                                      
a that is the heap of wi tness  in 
aramaic  
b that is the heap of witness  in 
hebrew  
c that is the watch post genesis  
45 
 i will not pass over this heap to thee  
and that thou shalt not pass over this 
heap and this pillar unto me  for harm  
53the god of abraham  and the god of 
nahor  the god of their father  judge 
betwixt us  and jacob swore by the 
fear of his father isaac  54and jacob 
offered a sacrifice in the m ountain  and 
called his brethren to eat bread  and 
they did eat bread  and tarried all night 
in the mountain   
and early in the morning 
laban rose up  and kissed his 
sons and his daughters  and blessed 
them  and laban departed  and 
returned unto his pla ce 2and jacob 
went on his way  and the angels of 
god met him  3and jacob said when 
he saw them  this is god s camp  
and he called the name of that place 
amahanaim   
  
4and jacob sent messengers before 
him to esau his brother unto the land 
of seir  the field of edom  5and he 
commanded them  saying  thus shall 
ye say unto my lord esau  thus saith 
thy servant jacob  i have sojourned 
with laban  and stayed until now  
6and i have oxen  and asses and 
flocks  and men servants and maid 
servants  and i have sent to tell my 
lord that i may find favour in thy 
sight  7and the messengers returned 
to jacob  saying  we came to thy 
brother esau  and moreover he cometh 
to meet thee and four hundred men 
                                                      
a that is two camps  with him  8then jacob was greatly 
afraid and was distressed  and he 
divided the people that was with him  
and the flocks  and the herds  and the 
camels  into two camps  9and he said  
if esau come to the one camp  and 
smite it  then the camp which is left 
shall escape  10and jacob said  o 
god of my father abraham  and god 
of my father isaac  o lord who saidst 
unto me  return unto thy country  and 
to thy kindred  and i will do thee good  
11i am not worthy of all the mercies  
and of all the truth  which thou hast 
shown unto thy servant  for with my 
staff i passed over this jordan  and 
now i am become two camps  
12deliver me  i pray thee  from the 
hand of my brother  from the hand of 
esau  for i fear him  lest he come and 
smite me  the mother with the 
children  13and thou saidst  i will 
surely do thee good  and make thy 
seed as the sand of the sea  which 
cannot be numbered for multitude  
14and he lodged there that night  and 
took of that which he had with him a 
present for esau hi s brother  15two 
hundred she goats and twenty he 
goats  two hundred ewes and twenty 
rams  16thirty milch camels and their 
colts  forty kine and ten bulls  twenty 
sheasses and ten foals  17and he 
delivered them into the hand of his 
servants  every drove by  itself  and 
said unto his servants  pass over 
before me  and put a space betwixt 
drove and drove  18and he 
commanded the foremost  saying  32 genesis  
46 
 when esau my brother meeteth thee  
and asketh thee  saying  whose art 
thou and whither goest thou  and 
whose are  these before thee  19then 
thou shalt say  they are thy servant 
jacob s it is a present sent unto my 
lord even unto esau  and behold  he 
also is behind us  20and he 
commanded also the second  and the 
third  and all that followed the droves  
saying  in this manner shall ye speak 
unto esau  when ye find him  21and ye 
shall say  moreover  behold  thy 
servant jacob is behind us  for he 
said i will appease him with the 
present that goeth before me  and 
afterward i will see his face  
peradventure he will accept me  22so 
the present passed over before him  
and he himself lodged that night in the 
camp   
23and he rose up that night  and 
took his two wives  and his two 
handmaids  and his eleven children  
and passed over the ford of the jabbok  
24and he took t hem and sent them 
over the stream  and sent over that 
which he had  25and jacob was left 
alone  and there wrestled a man with 
him until the breaking of the day  
26and when he saw that he prevailed 
not against him  he touched the hollow 
of his thigh  and t he hollow of jacob s 
thigh was strained  as he wrestled with 
him 27and he said  let me go  for the 
day breaketh  and he said  i will not 
let thee go  except thou bless me  
28and he said unto him  what is thy 
name  and be said  jacob  29and he said thy name shall be called no 
more jacob  but aisrael  for thou hast 
striven with god and with men  and 
hast prevailed  30and jacob asked 
him and said  tell me  i pray thee  
thy name  and he said  wherefore is 
it that thou dost ask after my name  
and he blessed him there  31and jacob 
called the name of the place bpeniel  
for i have seen god face to face  and 
my life is preserved  32and the sun 
rose upon him as he passed over 
cpeniel  and he limped upon his thigh  
33therefore the children of israel eat 
not the sinew of the thigh vein which 
is upon the hollow of the thigh  unto 
this day  because he touched the 
hollow of jacob s thigh  even in the 
sinew of the thigh vein  
 
and jacob lifted up his eyes 
and looked  and behold  esau 
came  and with hi m four hundred men  
and he divided the children unto leah  
and unto rachel  and unto the two 
handmaids  2and he put the handmaids 
and their children foremost  and leah 
and her children after  and rachel and 
joseph hindermost  3and he himself 
passed over be fore them  and bowed 
himself to the ground seven times  
until he came near to his brother  4and 
esau ran to meet him  and embraced 
him and fell on his neck  and kissed 
him and they wept  5and he lifted up 
                                                      
a that is he who striveth with god  
b that is the face of god  
c heb penuel  33 genesis  
47 
 his eyes  and saw the women and the 
children  and said who are these 
with thee  and he said  the children 
whom god hath graciously given thy 
servant  6then the handmaids came 
near they and their children  and they 
bowed down  7and leah also and her 
children came near  and bowed down  
and after came  joseph near and 
rachel  and they bowed down  8and 
he said  what meanest thou by all this 
camp which i met  and he said  to 
find favour in the sight of my lord  
9and esau said  i have enough  my 
brother  let that which thou hast be 
thine  10and jacob  said nay i pray 
thee if now i have found favour in thy 
sight  then receive my present at my 
hand  forasmuch as i have seen thy 
face as one seeth the face of god  and 
thou wast pleased with me  11take  i 
pray thee  my gift that is brought to 
thee because god hath dealt 
graciously with me  and because i 
have enough  and he urged him  and 
he took it  12and he said  let us take 
our journey  and let us go  and i will 
go before thee  13and he said unto 
him my lord knoweth that the 
children are tender  and that the flocks 
and herds giving suck are a care to me  
and if they overdrive them one day  all 
the flocks will die  14let my lord  i 
pray thee  pass over before his servant  
and i will journey on gently  according 
to the pace of the cattle that are b efore 
me and according to the pace of the 
children  until i come unto my lord 
unto seir  15and esau said  let me now leave with thee some of the folk 
that are with me  and he said  what 
needeth it  let me find favour in the 
sight of my lord  16so esau  returned 
that day on his way unto seir  17and 
jacob journeyed to succoth  and built 
him a house  and made booths for his 
cattle  therefore the name of the place 
is called asuccoth   
18and jacob came in peace to the 
city of shechem  which is in the land 
of canaan  when he came from 
paddan aram  and encamped before 
the city  19and he bought the parcel of 
ground  where he had spread his tent  
at the hand of the children of hamor  
shechem s father  for a hundred pieces 
of money  20and he erected there an 
altar and called it belelohe israel   
and dinah the daughter of 
leah  whom she had borne 
unto jacob  went out to see the 
daughters of the land  2and shechem 
the son of hamor the hivite  the prince 
of the land  saw her  and he took her  
and lay with her  and humbled her  
3and his soul did cleave unto dinah 
the daughter of jacob  and he loved the 
damsel  and spoke comfortingly unto 
the damsel  4and shechem spoke unto 
his father hamor  saying  get me this 
damsel to wife  5now jacob heard 
that he had defiled dinah his daughter  
and his sons were with his cattle in the 
field and jacob held his peace until 
they came  6and hamor the father of 
                                                      
a that is booths  
b that is god th e god of israel  34 genesis  
48 
 shechem went out unto jacob to speak 
with him  7and the sons of jacob came 
in from the field when they heard it  
and the men were grieved  and they 
were very wroth  because he had 
wrought a vile deed in israel in lying 
with jacob s daughter  which thing 
ought not to be done  8and hamor 
spoke with them  saying the soul of 
my son shechem longeth for your 
daughter  i pray you give her unto him 
to wife  9and make ye marriages with 
us give your daughters unto us  and 
take our daughters unto you  10and ye 
shall dwell with us  and the land shall 
be before you  dwell and trade ye 
therein  and get you possessions 
therein  11and she chem said unto her 
father and unto her brethren  let me 
find favour in your eyes  and what ye 
shall say unto me i will give  12ask me 
never so much dowry and gift  and i 
will give according as ye shall say 
unto me  but give me the damsel to 
wife 13and t he sons of jacob 
answered shechem and hamor his 
father with guile  and spoke  because 
he had defiled dinah their sister  14and 
said unto them  we cannot do this 
thing  to give our sister to one that is 
uncircumcised  for that were a 
reproach unto us  15only on this 
condition will we consent unto you  if 
ye will be as we are  that every male of 
you be circumcised  16then will we 
give our daughters unto you  and we 
will take your daughters to us  and we 
will dwell with you  and we will 
become one people  17but if ye will not hearken unto us  to be circumcised  
then will we take our daughter  and we 
will be gone  18and their words 
pleased hamor  and shechem hamor s 
son 19and the young man deferred not 
to do the thing  because he had delight 
in jacob s daught er and he was 
honoured above all the house of his 
father  20and hamor and shechem his 
son came unto the gate of their city  
and spoke with the men of their city  
saying  21these men are peaceable 
with us  therefore let them dwell in the 
land and trade t herein  for behold  the 
land is large enough for them  let us 
take their daughters to us for wives  
and let us give them our daughters  
22only on this condition will the men 
consent unto us to dwell with us  to 
become one people  if every male 
among us be  circumcised  as they are 
circumcised  23shall not their cattle 
and their substance and all their beasts 
be ours  only let us consent unto them  
and they will dwell with us  24and 
unto hamor and unto shechem his son 
hearkened all that went out of the gate  
of his city  and every male was 
circumcised  all that went out of the 
gate of his city  25and it came to pass 
on the third day  when they were in 
pain that two of the sons of jacob  
simeon and levi  dinah s brethren  
took each man his sword  and came 
upon the city unawares  and slew all 
the males  26and they slew hamor and 
shechem his son with the edge of the 
sword  and took dinah out of 
shechem s house  and went forth  genesis  
49 
 27the sons of jacob came upon the 
slain  and spoiled the city  because 
they had defile d their sister  28they 
took their flocks and their herds and 
their asses  and that which was in the 
city and that which was in the field  
29and all their wealth  and all their little 
ones and their wives  took they captive 
and spoiled  even all that was in  the 
house  30and jacob said to simeon and 
levi ye have troubled me  to make 
me odious unto the inhabitants of the 
land even unto the canaanites and the 
perizzites  and i being few in number  
they will gather themselves together 
against me and smite me  and i shall 
be destroyed  i and my house  31and 
they said  should one deal with our 
sister as with a harlot   
and god said unto jacob  
arise  go up to beth el and 
dwell there  and make there an altar 
unto god  who appeared unto thee 
when thou did st flee from the face of 
esau thy brother  2then jacob said 
unto his household  and to all that 
were with him  put away the strange 
gods that are among you  and purify 
yourselves  and change your garments  
3and let us arise  and go up to beth el 
and i w ill make there an altar unto 
god who answered me in the day of 
my distress  and was with me in the 
way which i went  4and they gave 
unto jacob all the foreign gods which 
were in their hand  and the rings which 
were in their ears  and jacob hid them 
under  the terebinth which was by 
shechem  5and they journeyed  and a terror of god was upon the cities that 
were round about them  and they did 
not pursue after the sons of jacob  6so 
jacob came to luz  which is in the 
land of canaan the same is beth el
he and all the people that were with 
him 7and he built there an altar  and 
called the place aelbethel because 
there god was revealed unto him  
when he fled from the face of his 
brother  8and deborah rebekah s 
nurse died  and she was buried below 
beth el under  the oak  and the name of 
it was called ballon bacuth   
9and god appeared unto jacob 
again  when he came from paddan 
aram  and blessed him  10and god said 
unto him  thy name is jacob  thy 
name shall not be called any more 
jacob  but israel shall be thy na me 
and he called his name israel  11and 
god said unto him  i am god 
almighty  be fruitful and multiply  a 
nation and a company of nations shall 
be of thee  and kings shall come out of 
thy loins  12and the land which i gave 
unto abraham and isaac  to the e i will 
give it  and to thy seed after thee will i 
give the land  13and god went up 
from him in the place where he spoke 
with him  14and jacob set up a pillar in 
the place where he spoke with him  a 
pillar of stone  and he poured out a 
drink offering the reon and poured oil 
thereon  15and jacob called the name 
of the place where god spoke with 
                                                      
a that is the god of beth el 
b that is the oak of weeping  35 genesis  
50 
 him beth el 16and they journeyed 
from beth el and there was still some 
way to come to ephrath  and rachel 
travailed  and she had hard labour  
17and it came to pa ss when she was in 
hard labour  that the mid wife said 
unto her  fear not  for this also is a 
son for thee  18and it came to pass  as 
her soul was in departing for she 
diedthat she called his name aben
oni but his father called him 
bbenjamin  19and ra chel died  and 
was buried in the way to ephrath the 
same is beth lehem  20and jacob set 
up a pillar upon her grave  the same is 
the pillar of rachel s grave unto this 
day 21and israel journeyed  and 
spread his tent beyond migdal eder 
22and it came to pas s while israel 
dwelt in that land  that reuben went 
and lay with bilhah his father s 
concubine  and israel heard of it   
now the sons of jacob were twelve  
23the sons of leah  reuben  jacob s 
firstborn and simeon  and levi  and 
judah  and issachar  and zebulun  
24the sons of rachel  joseph and 
benjamin  25and the sons of bilhah  
rachel s handmaid  dan and naphtali  
26and the sons of zilpah  leah s 
handmaid  gad and asher  these are 
the sons of jacob  that were born to 
him in paddan aram  27and jacob 
came  unto isaac his father to mamre  
to kiriatharba the same is hebron 
where abraham and isaac sojourned  
                                                      
a that is the son of my sorrow  
b that is the son of the right hand  28and the days of isaac were a 
hundred and fourscore years  29and 
isaac expired  and died  and was 
gathered unto his people  old and full 
of days  and esa u and jacob his sons 
buried him   
now these are the generations 
of esau the same is edom  
2esau took his wives of the daughters 
of canaan  adah the daughter of elon 
the hittite  and oholibamah the 
daughter of anah  the daughter of

and jacob dwelt in the land of 
his father s sojournings  in the 
land of canaan  2these are the 
generations of jacob  joseph  being 
seventeen years old  was feeding the 
flock with his brethren  being still a 
lad even with the sons of bilhah  and with the sons of zilpah  his father s 
wives  and joseph brought evil report 
of them unto their father  3now israel 
loved joseph more than all his 
children  becaus e he was the son of his 
old age  and he made him a coat of 
many colours  4and when his brethren 
saw that their father loved him more 
than all his brethren  they hated him  
and could not speak peaceably unto 
him 5and joseph dreamed a dream  
and he told it to his brethren  and they 
hated him yet the more  6and he said 
unto them  hear  i pray you  this 
dream which i have dreamed  7for 
behold  we were binding sheaves in 
the field  and lo my sheaf arose  and 
also stood upright  and behold  your 
sheaves cam e round about  and bowed 
down to my sheaf  8and his brethren 
said to him  shalt thou indeed reign 
over us  or shalt thou indeed have 
dominion over us  and they hated 
him yet the more for his dreams  and 
for his words  9and he dreamed yet 
another dream  and told it to his 
brethren  and said  behold  i have 
dreamed yet a dream  and behold  the 
sun and the moon and eleven stars 
bowed down to me  10and he told it to 
his father  and to his brethren  and his 
father rebuked him  and said unto him  
what is t his dream that thou hast 
dreamed  shall i and thy mother and 
thy brethren indeed come to bow down 
to thee to the earth  11and his 
brethren envied him  but his father 
kept the saying in mind   37 genesis  
53 
 12and his brethren went to feed their 
father s flock in shechem  13and israel 
said unto joseph  do not thy brethren 
feed the flock in shechem  come  and 
i will send thee unto them  and he 
said to him  here am i  14and he said 
to him  go now  see whether it is well 
with thy brethren  and well with the 
flock  and b ring me back word  so he 
sent him out of the vale of hebron  and 
he came to shechem  15and a certain 
man found him  and behold  he was 
wandering in the field  and the man 
asked him  saying  what seekest 
thou 16and he said  i seek my 
brethren  tell me  i pray thee  where 
they are feeding the flock  17and the 
man said  they are departed hence  
for i heard them say  let us go to 
dothan  and joseph went after his 
brethren  and found them in dothan  
18and they saw him afar off  and 
before he came near u nto them  they 
conspired against him to slay him  
19and they said one to another  
behold  this dreamer cometh  20come 
now therefore  and let us slay him  and 
cast him into one of the pits  and we 
will say  an evil beast hath devoured 
him and we shall see  what will 
become of his dreams  21and reuben 
heard it  and delivered him out of their 
hand  and said  let us not take his 
life 22and reuben said unto them  
shed no blood  cast him into this pit 
that is in the wilderness  but lay no 
hand upon him that he might deliver 
him out of their hand  to restore him to 
his father  23and it came to pass  when joseph was come unto his brethren  
that they stripped joseph of his coat  
the coat of many colours that was on 
him 24and they took him  and cast him 
into t he pit and the pit was empty  
there was no water in it  25and they sat 
down to eat bread  and they lifted up 
their eyes and looked  and behold  a 
caravan of ishmaelites came from 
gilead  with their camels bearing 
spicery and balm and ladanum  going 
to car ry it down to egypt  26and judah 
said unto his brethren  what profit is 
it if we slay our brother and conceal 
his blood  27come  and let us sell him 
to the ishmaelites  and let not our hand 
be upon him  for he is our brother  our 
flesh  and his brethren hearkened 
unto him  28and there passed by 
midianites  merchantmen  and they 
drew and lifted up joseph out of the 
pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites 
for twenty shekels of silver  and they 
brought joseph into egypt  29and 
reuben returned unto the pit  and 
behold  joseph was not in the pit  and 
he rent his clothes  30and he returned 
unto his brethren  and said  the child 
is not  and as for me  whither shall i 
go 31and they took joseph s coat  
and killed a he goat and dipped the 
coat in the blood  32and they sent the 
coat of many colours  and they brought 
it to their father  and said  this have 
we found  know now whether it is thy 
sons coat or not  33and he knew it  
and said  it is my son s coat  an evil 
beast hath devoured him  joseph is 
without d oubt torn in pieces  34and genesis  
54 
 jacob rent his garments  and put 
sackcloth upon his loins  and mourned 
for his son many days  35and all his 
sons and all his daughters rose up to 
comfort him  but he refused to be 
comforted  and he said  nay but i 
will go down  to the grave to my son 
mourning  and his father wept for 
him 36and the amidianites sold him 
into egypt unto potiphar  an officer of 
pharaoh s the captain of the guard   
and it came to pass at that 
time that judah went down 
from his brethren  and tu rned in to a 
certain adullamite  whose name was 
hirah  2and judah saw there a 
daughter of a certain canaanite whose 
name was shua  and he took her  and 
went in unto her  3and she conceived  
and bore a son  and he called his name 
er 4and she conceived agai n and 
bore a son  and she called his name 
onan  5and she yet again bore a son  
and called his name shelah  and he 
was at chezib  when she bore him  
6and judah took a wife for er his first 
born and her name was tamar  7and 
er judah s first born was wick ed in 
the sight of the lord and the lord 
slew him  8and judah said unto onan  
go in unto thy brother s wife  and 
perform the duty of a husband s 
brother unto her  and raise up seed to 
thy brother  9and onan knew that the 
seed would not be his  and it ca me to 
pass when he went in unto his 
brother s wife  that he spilled it on the 
                                                      
a heb medanites  ground  lest he should give seed to his 
brother  10and the thing which he did 
was evil in the sight of the lord and 
he slew him also  11then said judah to 
tamar his daughter inlaw remain a 
widow in thy father s house  till 
shelah my son be grown up  for he 
said lest he also die  like his 
brethren  and tamar went and dwelt 
in her father s house  12and in process 
of time shua s daughter  the wife of 
judah  died and judah wa s comforted  
and went up unto his sheep shearers to 
timnah  he and his friend hirah the 
adullamite  13and it was told tamar  
saying  behold  thy father inlaw 
goeth up to timnah to shear his 
sheep  14and she put off from her the 
garments of her widowhood  and 
covered herself with her veil  and 
wrapped herself  and sat in the 
entrance of enaim  which is by the 
way to timnah  for she saw that 
shelah was grown up  and she was not 
given unto him to wife  15when judah 
saw her  he thought her to be a harlot  
for she had covered her face  16and he 
turned unto her by the way  and said  
come  i pray thee  let me come in 
unto thee  for he knew not that she 
was his daughter inlaw and she said  
what wilt thou give me  that thou 
mayest come in unto me  17and he 
said i will send thee a kid of the 
goats from the flock  and she said  
wilt thou give me a pledge  till thou 
send it  18and he said  what pledge 
shall i give thee  and she said  thy 
signet and thy cord  and thy staff that 38 genesis  
55 
 is in thy hand  and he gav e them to 
her and came in unto her  and she 
conceived by him  19and she arose  
and went away  and put off her veil 
from her  and put on the garments of 
her widowhood  20and judah sent the 
kid of the goats by the hand of his 
friend the adullamite  to recei ve the 
pledge from the woman s hand  but he 
found her not  21then he asked the 
men of her place  saying  where is 
the harlot  that was at enaim by the 
wayside  and they said  there hath 
been no harlot here  22and he returned 
to judah  and said  i have  not found 
her and also the men of the place said  
there hath been no harlot here  23and 
judah said  let her take it  lest we be 
put to shame  behold  i sent this kid  
and thou hast not found her  24and it 
came to pass about three months after  
that it  was told judah  saying  tamar 
thy daughter inlaw hath played the 
harlot  and moreover  behold  she is 
with child by harlotry  and judah 
said bring her forth  and let her be 
burnt  25when she was brought forth  
she sent to her father inlaw saying  
by the man  whose these are  am i 
with child  and she said  discern  i 
pray thee  whose are these  the signet  
and the cords  and the staff  26and 
judah acknowledged them  and said  
she is more righteous than i  
forasmuch as i gave her not to shelah 
my son  and he knew her again no 
more  27and it came to pass in the time 
of her travail  that behold  twins were 
in her womb  28and it came to pass  when she travailed  that one put out a 
hand  and the midwife took and bound 
upon his hand a scarlet thread  saying  
this came out first  29and it came to 
pass as he drew back his hand  that 
behold his brother came out  and she 
said wherefore hast thou made a 
breach for thyself  therefore his 
name was called aperez  30and 
afterward came out his brother  that 
had the scarlet thread upon his hand  
and his name was called zerah   
and joseph was brought down 
to egypt  and potiphar  an 
officer of pharaoh s the captain of the 
guard  an egyptian  bought him of the 
hand of the ishmaelites  that had 
brought hi m down thither  2and the 
lord was with joseph  and he was a 
prosperous man  and he was in the 
house of his master the egyptian  3and 
his master saw that the lord was with 
him and that the lord made all that he 
did to prosper in his hand  4and joseph 
found  favour in his sight  and he 
ministered unto him  and he appointed 
him overseer over his house  and all 
that he had he put into his hand  5and 
it came to pass from the time that he 
appointed him overseer in his house  
and over all that he had  that the lord 
blessed the egyptian s house for 
joseph s sake  and the blessing of the 
lord was upon all that he had  in the 
house and in the field  6and he left all 
that he had in joseph s hand  and 
having him  he knew not aught save 
                                                      
a that is a breach  39 genesis  
56 
 the bread which he did eat  and 
joseph was of beautiful form  and fair 
to look upon   
7and it came to pass after these 
things  that his master s wife cast her 
eyes upon joseph  and she said  lie 
with me  8but he refused  and said 
unto his master s wife  behold  my 
master  having me  knoweth not what 
is in the house  and he hath put all that 
he hath into my hand  9he is not greater 
in this house than i  neither hath he 
kept back any thing from me but thee  
because thou art his wife  how then 
can i do this great wickedness  and sin 
agains t god  10and it came to pass  as 
she spoke to joseph day by day  that 
he hearkened not unto her  to lie by 
her or to be with her  11and it came to 
pass on a certain day  when he went 
into the house to do his work  and 
there was none of the men of the hou se 
there within  12that she caught him by 
his garment  saying  lie with me  
and he left his garment in her hand  
and fled  and got him out  13and it 
came to pass  when she saw that he 
had left his garment in her hand  and 
was fled forth  14that she calle d unto 
the men of her house  and spoke unto 
them  saying  see he hath brought in 
a hebrew unto us to mock us  he came 
in unto me to lie with me  and i cried 
with a loud voice  15and it came to 
pass when he heard that i lifted up my 
voice and cried  that he left his 
garment by me  and fled  and got him 
out 16and she laid up his garment by 
her until his master came home  17and she spoke unto him according to these 
words  saying  the hebrew servant  
whom thou hast brought unto us  came 
in unto me to moc k me  18and it came 
to pass  as i lifted up my voice and 
cried  that he left his garment by me  
and fled out  19and it came to pass  
when his master heard the words of his 
wife which she spoke unto him  
saying  after this manner did thy 
servant to me  that his wrath was 
kindled  20and joseph s master took 
him and put him into the prison  the 
place where the king s prisoners were 
bound  and he was there in the prison  
21but the lord was with joseph  and 
showed kindness unto him  and gave 
him favour in t he sight of the keeper of 
the prison  22and the keeper of the 
prison committed to joseph s hand all 
the prisoners that were in the prison  
and whatsoever they did there  he was 
the doer of it  23the keeper of the 
prison looked not to any thing that was 
under his hand  because the lord was 
with him  and that which he did  the 
lord made it to prosper   
and it came to pass after these 
things  that the butler of the 
king of egypt and his baker offended 
their lord the king of egypt  2and 
pharaoh was wroth aga inst his two 
officers  against the chief of the 
butlers  and against the chief of the 
bakers  3and he put them in ward in 
the house of the captain of the guard  
into the prison  the place where joseph 
was bound  4and the captain of the 
guard charged joseph  to be with them  40 genesis  
57 
 and he ministered unto them  and they 
continued a season in ward  5and they 
dreamed a dream both of them  each 
man his dream  in one night  each man 
according to the interpretation of his 
dream  the butler and the baker of the 
king of egy pt who were bound in the 
prison  6and joseph came in unto them 
in the morning  and saw them  and 
behold  they were sad  7and he asked 
pharaoh s officers that were with him 
in the ward of his master s house  
saying  wherefore look ye so sad to 
day 8and they said unto him  we 
have dreamed a dream  and there is 
none that can interpret it  and joseph 
said unto them  do not interpretations 
belong to god  tell it me  i pray you  
9and the chief butler told his dream to 
joseph  and said to him  in my drea m 
behold  a vine was before me  10and in 
the vine were three branches  and as it 
was budding  its blossoms shot forth  
and the clusters thereof brought forth 
ripe grapes  11and pharaoh s cup was 
in my hand  and i took the grapes  and 
pressed them into pha raohs cup  and i 
gave the cup into pharaoh s hand  
12and joseph said unto him  this is 
the interpretation of it  the three 
branches are three days  13within yet 
three days shall pharaoh lift up thy 
head  and restore thee unto thine 
office  and thou shal t give pharaoh s 
cup into his hand  after the former 
manner when thou wast his butler  
14but have me in thy remembrance 
when it shall be well with thee  and 
show kindness  i pray thee  unto me  and make mention of me unto 
pharaoh  and bring me out of this 
house  15for indeed i was stolen away 
out of the land of the hebrews  and 
here also have i done nothing that they 
should put me into the dungeon  
16when the chief baker saw that the 
interpretation was good  he said unto 
joseph  i also saw in my dream  and 
behold  three baskets of white bread 
were on my head  17and in the 
uppermost basket there was of all 
manner of baked food for pharaoh  
and the birds did eat them out of the 
basket upon my head  18and joseph 
answered and said  this is the 
interpretatio n thereof  the three baskets 
are three days  19within yet three days 
shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off 
thee and shall hang thee on a tree  and 
the birds shall eat thy flesh from off 
thee 20and it came to pass the third 
day which was pharaoh s bir thday  
that he made a feast unto all his 
servants  and he lifted up the head of 
the chief butler and the head of the 
chief baker among his servants  21and 
he restored the chief butler back unto 
his butlership  and he gave the cup into 
pharaoh s hand  22but he hanged the 
chief baker  as joseph had interpreted 
to them  23yet did not the chief butler 
remember joseph  but forgot him   
 
 
and it came to pass at the end 
of two full years  that pharaoh 41 genesis  
58 
 dreamed  and behold  he stood by the 
ariver  2and behol d there came up out 
of the river seven kine  wellfavoured 
and fat fleshed  and they fed in the 
reedgrass  3and behold  seven other 
kine came up after them out of the 
river  ill favoured and lean fleshed  
and stood by the other kine upon the 
brink of th e river  4and the ill 
favoured and lean fleshed kine did eat 
up the seven well favoured and fat 
kine so pharaoh awoke  5and he slept 
and dreamed a second time  and 
behold  seven ears of corn came up 
upon one stalk  rank and good  6and 
behold  seven ears  thin and blasted 
with the east wind  sprung up after 
them  7and the thin ears swallowed up 
the seven rank and full ears  and 
pharaoh awoke  and behold  it was a 
dream  8and it came to pass in the 
morning that his spirit was troubled  
and he sent and cal led for all the 
magicians of egypt  and all the wise 
men thereof  and pharaoh told them 
his dream  but there was none that 
could interpret them unto pharaoh  
9then spoke the chief butler unto 
pharaoh  saying  i make mention of 
my faults this day  10pharao h was 
wroth with his servants  and put me in 
the ward of the house of the captain of 
the guard  me and the chief baker  
11and we dreamed a dream in one 
night  i and he  we dreamed each man 
according to the interpretation of his 
dream  12and there was with us there a 
                                                      
a that is the nile  young man  a hebrew  servant to the 
captain of the guard  and we told him  
and he interpreted to us our dreams  to 
each man according to his dream he 
did interpret  13and it came to pass  as 
he interpreted to us  so it was  i was 
restored unto m ine office  and he was 
hanged  14then pharaoh sent and 
called joseph  and they brought him 
hastily out of the dungeon  and he 
shaved himself  and changed his 
raiment  and came in unto pharaoh  
15and pharaoh said unto joseph  i 
have dreamed a dream  and t here is 
none that can interpret it  and i have 
heard say of thee  that when thou 
hearest a dream thou canst interpret it  
16and joseph answered pharaoh  
saying  it is not in me  god will give 
pharaoh an answer of peace  17and 
pharaoh spoke unto joseph  in my 
dream  behold  i stood upon the brink 
of the river  18and behold  there came 
up out of the river seven kine  fat
fleshed and well favoured  and they 
fed in the reedgrass  19and behold  
seven other kine came up after them  
poor and very ill favoure d and lean 
fleshed  such as i never saw in all the 
land of egypt for badness  20and the 
lean and ill favoured kine did eat up 
the first seven fat kine  21and when 
they had eaten them up  it could not be 
known that they had eaten them  but 
they were still i llfavoured as at the 
beginning  so i awoke  22and i saw in 
my dream  and behold  seven ears 
came up upon one stalk  full and good  
23and behold  seven ears  withered  genesis  
59 
 thin and blasted with the east wind  
sprung up after them  24and the thin 
ears swallo wed up the seven good 
ears and i told it unto the magicians  
but there was none that could declare it 
to me  25and joseph said unto 
pharaoh  the dream of pharaoh is 
one what god is about to do he hath 
declared unto pharaoh  26the seven 
good kine are se ven years  and the 
seven good ears are seven years  the 
dream is one  27and the seven lean and 
illfavoured kine that came up after 
them are seven years  and also the 
seven empty ears blasted with the east 
wind  they shall be seven years of 
famine  28that is the thing which i 
spoke unto pharaoh  what god is 
about to do he hath shown unto 
pharaoh  29behold  there come seven 
years of great plenty throughout all the 
land of egypt  30and there shall arise 
after them seven years of famine  and 
all the plenty sha ll be forgotten in the 
land of egypt  and the famine shall 
consume the land  31and the plenty 
shall not be known in the land by 
reason of that famine which followeth  
for it shall be very grievous  32and for 
that the dream was doubled unto 
pharaoh twice  it is because the thing 
is established by god  and god will 
shortly bring it to pass  33now 
therefore let pharaoh look out a man 
discreet and wise  and set him over the 
land of egypt  34let pharaoh do this  
and let him appoint overseers over the 
land and t ake up the fifth part of the 
land of egypt in the seven years of plenty  35and let them gather all the 
food of these good years that come  
and lay up corn under the hand of 
pharaoh for food in the cities  and let 
them keep it  36and the food shall be 
for a  store to the land against the seven 
years of famine  which shall be in the 
land of egypt  that the land perish not 
through the famine  37and the thing 
was good in the eyes of pharaoh  and 
in the eyes of all his servants  38and 
pharaoh said unto his serva nts can 
we find such a one as this  a man in 
whom the spirit of god is  39and 
pharaoh said unto joseph  forasmuch 
as god hath shown thee all this  there 
is none so discreet and wise as thou  
40thou shalt be over my house  and 
according unto thy word sh all all my 
people be ruled  only in the throne will 
i be greater than thou  41and pharaoh 
said unto joseph  see i have set thee 
over all the land of egypt  42and 
pharaoh took off his signet ring from 
his hand  and put it upon joseph s 
hand  and arrayed  him in vestures of 
fine linen  and put a gold chain about 
his neck  43and he made him to ride in 
the second chariot which he had  and 
they cried before him  abrech  and 
he set him over all the land of egypt  
44and pharaoh said unto joseph  i am 
pharaoh  and without thee shall no 
man lift up his hand or his foot in all 
the land of egypt  45and pharaoh 
called joseph s name zaphenath 
paneah  and he gave him to wife 
asenath the daughter of poti phera 
priest of on  and joseph went out genesis  
60 
 over the land of egypt  46and joseph 
was thirty years old when he stood 
before pharaoh king of egypt and 
joseph went out from the presence of 
pharaoh  and went throughout all the 
land of egypt  47and in the seven years 
of plenty the earth brought forth in 
heaps  48and he gath ered up all the 
food of the seven years which were in 
the land of egypt  and laid up the food 
in the cities  the food of the field  
which was round about every city  laid 
he up in the same  49and joseph laid 
up corn as the sand of the sea  very 
much  until they left off numbering  
for it was without number  50and unto 
joseph were born two sons before the 
year of famine came  whom asenath 
the daughter of poti phera priest of on 
bore unto him  51and joseph called the 
name of the first born amanasseh  for 
god hath made me forget all my toil  
and all my father s house  52and the 
name of the second called he 
bephraim  for god hath made me 
fruitful in the land of my affliction  
53and the seven years of plenty  that 
was in the land of egypt  came to an 
end 54and the seven years of famine 
began to come  according as joseph 
had said  and there was famine in all 
lands  but in all the land of egypt there 
was bread  55and when all the land of 
egypt was famished  the people cried 
to pharaoh for bread  and pharaoh sai d 
                                                      
a that is making to forget  
b from a hebrew wor d signifying to 
be fruitful  unto all the egyptians  go unto 
joseph  what he saith to you  do 
56and the famine was over all the face 
of the earth  and joseph opened all the 
storehouses  and sold unto the 
egyptians  and the famine was sore in 
the land of egypt  57and all countries  
came into egypt to joseph to buy corn  
because the famine was sore in all the 
earth   
now jacob saw that there was 
corn in egypt  and jacob said 
unto his sons  why do ye look one 
upon another  2and he said  behold  
i have heard that there is corn in  
egypt  get you down thither  and buy 
for us from thence  that we may live  
and not die  3and joseph s ten 
brethren went down to buy corn from 
egypt  4but benjamin  joseph s 
brother  jacob sent not with his 
brethren  for he said  lest 
peradventure harm b efall him  5and 
the sons of israel came to buy among 
those that came  for the famine was in 
the land of caanan  6and joseph was 
the governor over the land  he it was 
that sold to all the people of the land  
and joseph s brethren came  and 
bowed down to hi m with their faces to 
the earth  7and joseph saw his 
brethren  and he knew them  but made 
himself strange unto them  and spoke 
roughly with them  and he said unto 
them  whence come ye  and they 
said from the land of canaan to buy 
food 8and joseph kne w his brethren  
but they knew him not  9and joseph 
remembered the dreams which he 42 genesis  
61 
 dreamed of them  and said unto them  
ye are spies  to see the nakedness of 
the land ye are come  10and they said 
unto him  nay my lord  but to buy 
food are thy servants c ome 11we are 
all one man s sons  we are upright 
men thy servants are no spies  12and 
he said unto them  nay but to see the 
nakedness of the land ye are come  
13and they said  we thy servants are 
twelve brethren  the sons of one man 
in the land of ca naan  and behold  the 
youngest is this day with our father  
and one is not  14and joseph said unto 
them  that is it that i spoke unto you  
saying  ye are spies  15hereby ye shall 
be proved  as pharaoh liveth  ye shall 
not go forth hence  except your 
youngest brother come hither  16send 
one of you  and let him fetch your 
brother  and ye shall be bound  that 
your words may be proved  whether 
there be truth in you  or else  as 
pharaoh liveth  surely ye are spies  
17and he put them all together into 
ward th ree days  18and joseph said 
unto them the third day  this do  and 
live for i fear god  19if ye be upright 
men let one of your brethren be bound 
in your prison house  but go ye  carry 
corn for the famine of your houses  
20and bring your youngest brother unto 
me so shall your words be verified  
and ye shall not die  and they did so  
21and they said one to another  we 
are verily guilty concerning our 
brother  in that we saw the distress of 
his soul  when he besought us  and we 
would not hear  therefore i s this distress come upon us  22and reuben 
answered them  saying  spoke i not 
unto you  saying  do not sin against 
the child  and ye would not hear  
therefore also  behold  his blood is 
required  23and they knew not that 
joseph understood them  for the 
interpreter was between them  24and 
he turned himself about from them  
and wept  and he returned to them  and 
spoke to them  and took simeon from 
among them  and bound him before 
their eyes  25then joseph commanded 
to fill their vessels with corn  and to 
restore every man s money into his 
sack and to give them provision for 
the way  and thus was it done unto 
them  26and they laded their asses with 
their corn  and departed thence  27and 
as one of them opened his sack to give 
his ass provender in the lodging place  
he espied his money  and behold  it 
was in the mouth of his sack  28and he 
said unto his brethren  my money is 
restored  and lo it is even in my 
sack and their heart failed them  and 
they turned trembling one to another  
saying  what is this  that god hath 
done unto us  29and they came unto 
jacob their father unto the land of 
canaan  and told him all that had 
befallen them  saying  30the man  the 
lord of the land  spoke roughly with 
us and took us for spies of the 
country  31and we said unt o him  we 
are upright men  we are no spies  32we 
are twelve brethren  sons of our father  
one is not  and the youngest is this day 
with our father in the land of canaan  genesis  
62 
 33and the man  the lord of the land  
said unto us  hereby shall i know that 
ye are upr ight men  leave one of your 
brethren with me  and take corn for the 
famine of your houses  and go your 
way 34and bring your youngest 
brother unto me  then shall i know that 
ye are no spies  but that ye are upright 
men so will i deliver you your 
brother  and ye shall traffic in the 
land 35and it came to pass as they 
emptied their sacks  that behold  every 
mans bundle of money was in his 
sack and when they and their father 
saw their bundles of money  they were 
afraid  36and jacob their father said 
unto them  me have ye bereaved of 
my children  joseph is not  and 
simeon is not  and ye will take 
benjamin away  upon me are all these 
things come  37and reuben spoke 
unto his father  saying  thou shalt 
slay my two sons  if i bring him not to 
thee deliver him into my hand  and i 
will bring him back to thee  38and he 
said my son shall not go down with 
you for his brother is dead  and he 
only is left  if harm befall him by the 
way in which ye go  then will ye bring 
down my gray hairs with sorrow to the 
grave  
and the famine was sore in the 
land 2and it came to pass  
when they had eaten up the corn which 
they had brought out of egypt  that 
their father said unto them  go again  
buy us a little food  3and judah spoke 
unto him  saying  the man did 
earnestly forewarn us  saying  ye shall not see my face  except your brother 
be with you  4if thou wilt send our 
brother with us  we will go down and 
buy thee food  5but if thou wilt not 
send him  we will not go down  for the 
man said unto us  ye shall not se e my 
face except your brother be with you  
6and israel said  wherefore dealt ye 
so ill with me  as to tell the man 
whether ye had yet a brother  7and 
they said  the man asked straitly 
concerning ourselves  and concerning 
our kindred  saying  is your f ather yet 
alive  have ye another brother  and we 
told him according to the tenor of 
these words  could we in any wise 
know that he would say  bring your 
brother down  8and judah said unto 
israel his father  send the lad with 
me and we will arise and go  that we 
may live  and not die  both we  and 
thou and also our little ones  9i will be 
surety for him  of my hand shalt thou 
require him  if i bring him not unto 
thee and set him before thee  then let 
me bear the blame for ever  10for 
except we had linge red surely we had 
now returned a second time  11and 
their father israel said unto them  if it 
be so now  do this  take of the choice 
fruits of the land in your vessels  and 
carry down the man a present  a little 
balm  and a little honey  spicery and 
ladanum  nuts and almonds  12and 
take double money in your hand  and 
the money that was returned in the 
mouth of your sacks carry back in your 
hand  peradventure it was an 
oversight  13take also your brother  and 43 genesis  
63 
 arise  go again unto the man  14and 
god almig hty give you mercy before 
the man  that he may release unto you 
your other brother and benjamin  and 
as for me  if i be bereaved of my 
children  i am bereaved   
15and the men took that present  and 
they took double money in their hand  
and benjamin  and r ose up  and went 
down to egypt  and stood before 
joseph  16and when joseph saw 
benjamin with them  he said to the 
steward of his house  bring the men 
into the house  and kill the beasts  and 
prepare the meat  for the men shall 
dine with me at noon  17and the man 
did as joseph bade  and the man 
brought the men into joseph s house  
18and the men were afraid  because 
they were brought into joseph s house  
and they said  because of the money 
that was returned in our sacks at the 
first time are we brought in  that he 
may seek occasion against us  and fall 
upon us  and take us for bondmen  and 
our asses  19and they came near to the 
steward of joseph s house  and they 
spoke unto him at the door of the 
house  20and said  oh my lord  we 
came indeed down at the f irst time to 
buy food  21and it came to pass  when 
we came to the lodging place  that we 
opened our sacks  and behold  every 
mans money was in the mouth of his 
sack our money in full weight  and we 
have brought it back in our hand  
22and other money hav e we brought 
down in our hand to buy food  we 
know not who put our money in our sacks  23and he said  peace be to 
you fear not  your god  and the god 
of your father  hath given you treasure 
in your sacks  i had your money  and 
he brought simeon out unt o them  
24and the man brought the men into 
joseph s house  and gave them water  
and they washed their feet  and he 
gave their asses provender  25and they 
made ready the present against 
joseph s coming at noon  for they 
heard that they should eat bread ther e 
26and when joseph came home  they 
brought him the present which was in 
their hand into the house  and bowed 
down to him to the earth  27and he 
asked them of their welfare  and said  
is your father well  the old man of 
whom ye spoke  is he yet alive  
28and they said  thy servant our 
father is well  he is yet alive  and 
they bowed the head  and made 
obeisance  29and he lifted up his eyes  
and saw benjamin his brother  his 
mother s son  and said  is this your 
youngest brother of whom ye spoke 
unto me  and he said  god be 
gracious unto thee  my son  30and 
joseph made haste  for his heart 
yearned toward his brother  and he 
sought where to weep  and he entered 
into his chamber  and wept there  
31and he washed his face  and came 
out and he refrained him self and said  
set on bread  32and they set on for 
him by himself  and for them by 
themselves  and for the egyptians  that 
did eat with him  by themselves  
because the egyptians might not eat genesis  
64 
 bread with the hebrews  for that is an 
abomination unto the e gyptians  33and 
they sat before him  the firstborn 
according to his birthright  and the 
youngest according to his youth  and 
the men marvelled one with another  
34and portions were taken unto them 
from before him  but benjamin s 
portion was five times so m uch as any 
of theirs  and they drank  and were 
merry with him   
and he commanded the 
steward of his house  saying  
fill the men s sacks with food  as 
much as they can carry  and put every 
mans money in his sack s mouth  
2and put my goblet  the silver goblet  
in the sack s mouth of the youngest  
and his corn money  and he did 
according to the word that joseph had 
spoken  3as soon as the morning was 
light the men were sent away  they 
and their asses  4and when they were 
gone out of the city  and were n ot yet 
far off  joseph said unto his steward  
up follow after the men  and when 
thou dost overtake them  say unto 
them  wherefore have ye rewarded 
evil for good  5is not this it in which 
my lord drinketh  and whereby he 
indeed divineth  ye have done evil  in 
so doing  6and he overtook them  and 
he spoke unto them these words  7and 
they said unto him  wherefore 
speaketh my lord such words as these  
far be it from thy servants that they 
should do such a thing  8behold  the 
money  which we found in our 
sacksmouths  we brought back unto thee out of the land of canaan  how 
then should we steal out of thy lord s 
house silver or gold  9with 
whomsoever of thy servants it be 
found  let him die  and we also will be 
my lord s bondmen  10and he said  
now also let it be according unto your 
words  he with whom it is found shall 
be my bondman  and ye shall be 
blameless  11then they hastened  and 
took down every man his sack to the 
ground  and opened every man his 
sack 12and he searched  beginning at 
the eldest  and leaving off at the 
youngest  and the goblet was found in 
benjamin s sack  13and they rent their 
clothes  and laded every man his ass  
and returned to the city  14and judah 
and his brethren came to joseph s 
house  and he was yet there  and they 
fell before him on the ground  15and 
joseph said unto them  what deed is 
this that ye have done  know ye not 
that such a man as i will indeed 
divine  16and judah said  what shall 
we say unto my lord  what shall we 
speak  or how shall we clear 
ourselves  god hath fo und out the 
iniquity of thy servants  behold  we are 
my lord s bondmen  both we  and he 
also in whose hand the cup is found  
17and he said  far be it from me that i 
should do so  the man in whose hand 
the goblet is found  he shall be my 
bondman  but as f or you  get you up in 
peace unto your father   
 
 
 
 44 genesis  
65 
  
 
18then judah came near unto him  
and said  oh my lord  let thy servant  
i pray thee  speak a word in my lord s 
ears and let not thine anger burn 
against thy servant  for thou art even 
as pharaoh  19my lord asked his 
servants  saying  have ye a father  or a 
brother  20and we said unto my lord  
we have a father  an old man  and a 
child of his old age  a little one  and 
his brother is dead  and he alone is left 
of his mother  and his father loveth 
him 21and thou saidst unto thy 
servants  bring him down unto me  
that i may set mine eyes upon him  
22and we said unto my lord  the lad 
cannot leave his father  for if he should 
leave his father  his father would die  
23and thou saidst unto thy servants  
except your youngest brother come 
down with you  ye shall see my face 
no more  24and it came to pass when 
we came up unto thy servant my 
father  we told him the words of my 
lord 25and our father said  go again  
buy us a little food  26and we said  we 
cannot go down  if our youngest 
brother be with us  then will we go 
down  for we may not see the man s 
face except our youngest brother be 
with us  27and thy servant my father 
said unto us  ye know that my wife 
bore me two sons  28and the one went 
out from me  and i said  surely he is 
torn in pieces  and i have not seen him 
since  29and if ye take this one also 
from me  and harm befall him  ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow 
to the grave  30now therefore when i 
come to thy servant my father  and the 
lad is not with us  seeing that his soul 
is bound up with the lad s soul  31it 
will come to pass  when he seeth that 
the lad is not with us  that he will die  
and thy servants will bring down the 
gray hairs of thy servant our father 
with sorrow to the grave  32for thy 
servant became surety for the lad unto 
my father  saying  if i bring him not 
unto thee  then shall i bear the blame 
to my father for ever  33now therefore  
let thy servant  i pray thee  abide 
instead of the lad a bondman to my 
lord and let the l ad go up with his 
brethren  34for how shall i go up to my 
father  if the lad be not with me  lest i 
look upon the evil that shall come on 
my father   
then joseph could not refrain 
himself before all them that 
stood by him  and he cried  cause 
every ma n to go out from me  and 
there stood no man with him  while 
joseph made himself known unto his 
brethren  2and he wept aloud  and the 
egyptians heard  and the house of 
pharaoh heard  3and joseph said unto 
his brethren  i am joseph  doth my 
father yet live  and his brethren 
could not answer him  for they were 
affrighted at his presence  4and joseph 
said unto his brethren  come near to 
me i pray you  and they came near  
and he said  i am joseph your 
brother  whom ye sold into egypt  
5and now be not grie ved nor angry 45 genesis  
66 
 with yourselves  that ye sold me 
hither  for god did send me before you 
to preserve life  6for these two years 
hath the famine been in the land  and 
there are yet five years  in which there 
shall be neither plowing nor harvest  
7and god sent  me before you to give 
you a remnant on the earth  and to save 
you alive for a great deliverance  8so 
now it was not you that sent me hither  
but god  and he hath made me a 
father to pharaoh  and lord of all his 
house  and ruler over all the land of 
egypt  9hasten ye  and go up to my 
father  and say unto him  thus saith 
thy son joseph  god hath made me 
lord of all egypt  come down unto me  
tarry not  10and thou shalt dwell in the 
land of goshen  and thou shalt be near 
unto me  thou and thy children  and 
thy children s children  and thy flocks  
and thy herds  and all that thou hast  
11and there will i sustain thee  for there 
are yet five years of famine  lest thou 
come to poverty  thou and thy 
household  and all that thou hast  
12and behold  your eyes see  and the 
eyes of my brother benjamin  that it is 
my mouth that speaketh unto you  
13and ye shall tell my father of all my 
glory in egypt  and of all that ye have 
seen and ye shall hasten and bring 
down my father hither  14and he fell 
upon his brother ben jamin s neck  and 
wept  and benjamin wept upon his 
neck  15and he kissed all his brethren  
and wept upon them  and after that his 
brethren talked with him   16and the report thereof was heard 
in pharaoh s house  saying  joseph s 
brethren are come  and it  pleased 
pharaoh well  and his servants  17and 
pharaoh said unto joseph  say unto 
thy brethren  this do ye  lade your 
beasts  and go  get you unto the land of 
canaan  18and take your father and 
your households  and come unto me  
and i will give you the go od of the 
land of egypt  and ye shall eat the fat 
of the land  19now thou art 
commanded  this do ye  take you 
wagons out of the land of egypt for 
your little ones  and for your wives  
and bring your father  and come  
20also regard not your stuff  for the 
good things of all the land of egypt are 
yours  21and the sons of israel did so  
and joseph gave them wagons  
according to the commandment of 
pharaoh  and gave them provision for 
the way  22to all of them he gave each 
man changes of raiment  but to 
benjami n he gave three hundred 
shekels of silver  and five changes of 
raiment  23and to his father he sent in 
like manner ten asses laden with the 
good things of egypt  and ten she 
asses laden with corn and bread and 
victual for his father by the way  24so 
he sen t his brethren away  and they 
departed  and he said unto them  see 
that ye fall not out by the way  25and 
they went up out of egypt  and came 
into the land of canaan unto jacob 
their father  26and they told him  
saying  joseph is yet alive  and he is 
ruler over all the land of egypt  and genesis  
67 
 his heart fainted  for he believed them 
not 27and they told him all the words 
of joseph  which he had said unto 
them  and when he saw the wagons 
which joseph had sent to carry him  
the spirit of jacob their father revi ved 
28and israel said  it is enough  joseph 
my son is yet alive  i will go and see 
him before i die   
and israel took his journey 
with all that he had  and came 
to beer sheba  and offered sacrifices 
unto the god of his father isaac  2and 
god spoke un to israel in the visions of 
the night  and said  jacob  jacob  
and he said  here am i  3and he 
said i am god  the god of thy father  
fear not to go down into egypt  for i 
will there make of thee a great nation  
4i will go down with thee into egypt

joseph  to show the way before him 
unto goshen  and they came into the 
land of goshen  29and joseph made 
ready his chariot  and went up to meet 
israel his father  to goshen  and he 
presented himself unto him  and fell on 
his neck  and wept on his neck a good 
while  30and israel said unto joseph  
now let me die  since i have seen thy 
face that thou art yet alive  31and 
joseph said unto his brethren  and unto 
his father s house  i will go up  and 
tell pharaoh  and will say unto him  
my brethren  and my father s house  
who were in the land of canaan  are 
come unto me  32and the men are 
shepherds  for they have been keepers 
of cattle  and they  have brought their 
flocks  and their herds  and all that 
they have  33and it shall come to pass  
when pharaoh shall call you  and shall 
say what is your occupation  34that ye 
shall say  thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even 
until n ow both we  and our fathers  
that ye may dwell in the land of 
goshen  for every shepherd is an 
abomination unto the egyptians   
then joseph went in and told 
pharaoh  and said  my father 
and my brethren  and their flocks  and 
their herds  and all that  they have  are 
come out of the land of canaan  and 
behold  they are in the land of 
goshen  2and from among his 
brethren he took five men  and 
presented them unto pharaoh  3and 
pharaoh said unto his brethren  what 
is your occupation  and they said 
unto pharaoh  thy servants are 
shepherds  both we  and our fathers  
4and they said unto pharaoh  to 
sojourn in the land are we come  for 
there is no pasture for thy 
servants flocks  for the famine is sore 
in the land of canaan  now therefore  
we pray thee  let thy servants dwell in 
the land of goshen  5and pharaoh 
spoke unto joseph  saying  thy father 
and thy brethren are come unto thee  
6the land of egypt is before thee  in the 
best of the land make thy father and 
thy brethren to dwell  in the land of 
goshen let them dwell  and if thou 
knowest any able men among them  
then make them rulers over my cattle  
7and joseph brought in jacob his 
father  and set him before pharaoh  
and jacob blessed pharaoh  8and 
pharaoh said unto jacob  how many 
are the days of the years of thy life  
9and jacob said unto pharaoh  the 47 genesis  
69 
 days of the years of my sojournings 
are a hundred and thirty years  few and 
evil have been the days of the years of 
my life  and they have not attained 
unto the days of the years of the life of 
my fathers in the days of their 
sojournings  10and jacob blessed 
pharaoh  and went out from the 
presence of pharaoh  11and joseph 
placed his father and his brethren  and 
gave them a possession in the land of 
egypt  in the best of the land  in the 
land of ram eses as pharaoh had 
commanded  12and joseph sustained 
his father  and his brethren  and all his 
father s household  with bread  
according to the want of their little 
ones  
13and there was no bread in all the 
land for the famine was very sore  so 
that th e land of egypt and the land of 
canaan languished by reason of the 
famine  14and joseph gathered up all 
the money that was found in the land 
of egypt  and in the land of canaan  
for the corn which they bought  and 
joseph brought the money into 
pharaoh s ho use 15and when the 
money was all spent in the land of 
egypt  and in the land of canaan  all 
the egyptians came unto joseph  and 
said give us bread  for why should 
we die in thy presence  for our money 
faileth  16and joseph said  give your 
cattle  and i will give you bread  for 
your cattle  if money fail  17and they 
brought their cattle unto joseph  and 
joseph gave them bread in exchange 
for the horses  and for the flocks  and for the herds  and for the asses  and he 
fed them with bread in exchange fo r 
all their cattle for that year  18and 
when that year was ended  they came 
unto him the second year  and said 
unto him  we will not hide from my 
lord how that our money is all spent  
and the herds of cattle are my lord s 
there is nought left in the sig ht of my 
lord but our bodies  and our lands  
19wherefore should we die before 
thine eyes  both we and our land  buy 
us and our land for bread  and we and 
our land will be bondmen unto 
pharaoh  and give us seed  that we 
may live  and not die  and that the land 
be not desolate  20so joseph bought 
all the land of egypt for pharaoh  for 
the egyptians sold every man his field  
because the famine was sore upon 
them  and the land became pharaoh s 
21and as for the people  he removed 
them city by city  from one e nd of the 
border of egypt even to the other end 
thereof  22only the land of the priests 
bought he not  for the priests had a 
portion from pharaoh  and did eat their 
portion which pharaoh gave them  
wherefore they sold not their land  
23then joseph said unt o the people  
behold  i have bought you this day 
and your land for pharaoh  lo here is 
seed for you  and ye shall sow the 
land 24and it shall come to pass at the 
ingatherings  that ye shall give a fifth 
unto pharaoh  and four parts shall be 
your own  for seed of the field  and for 
your food  and for them of your 
households  and for food for your little genesis  
70 
 ones 25and they said  thou hast 
saved our lives  let us find favour in 
the sight of my lord  and we will be 
pharaoh s bondmen  26and joseph 
made it a statute concerning the land 
of egypt unto this day  that pharaoh 
should have the fifth  only the land of 
the priests alone became not 
pharaoh s 27and israel dwelt in the 
land of egypt  in the land of goshen  
and they got them possessions therein  
and were  fruitful  and multiplied 
exceedingly   
 
28and jacob lived in the land of 
egypt seventeen years  so the days of 
jacob  the years of his life  were a 
hundred forty and seven years  29and 
the time drew near that israel must die  
and he called his son jos eph and said 
unto him  if now i have found favour 
in thy sight  put i pray thee  thy hand 
under my thigh  and deal kindly and 
truly with me  bury me not  i pray 
thee in egypt  30but when i sleep with 
my fathers  thou shalt carry me out of 
egypt  and bu ry me in their burying 
place  and he said  i will do as thou 
hast said  31and he said  swear unto 
me and he swore unto him  and 
israel bowed down upon the bed s 
head   
and it came to pass after these 
things  that one said to joseph  
behold  thy f ather is sick  and he 
took with him his two sons  manasseh 
and ephraim  2and one told jacob  and 
said behold  thy son joseph cometh 
unto thee  and israel strengthened himself  and sat upon the bed  3and 
jacob said unto joseph  god 
almighty appeared un to me at luz in 
the land of canaan  and blessed me  
4and said unto me  behold  i will make 
thee fruitful  and multiply thee  and i 
will make of thee a company of 
peoples  and will give this land to thy 
seed after thee for an everlasting 
possession  5and no w thy two sons  
who were born unto thee in the land of 
egypt before i came unto thee into 
egypt  are mine  ephraim and 
manasseh  even as reuben and 
simeon  shall be mine  6and thy issue  
that thou begettest after them  shall be 
thine  they shall be called after the 
name of their brethren in their 
inheritance  7and as for me  when i 
came from paddan  rachel died unto 
me in the land of canaan in the way  
when there was still some way to come 
unto ephrath  and i buried her there in 
the way to ephrath the same is beth 
lehem  8and israel beheld joseph s 
sons and said  who are these  9and 
joseph said unto his father  they are 
my sons  whom god hath given me 
here and he said  bring them  i pray 
thee unto me  and i will bless them  
10now the eyes of israel  were dim for 
age so that he could not see  and he 
brought them near unto him  and he 
kissed them  and embraced them  
11and israel said unto joseph  i had 
not thought to see thy face  and lo 
god hath let me see thy seed also  
12and joseph brought them  out from 
between his knees  and he fell down 48 genesis  
71 
 on his face to the earth  13and joseph 
took them both  ephraim in his right 
hand toward israel s left hand  and 
manasseh in his left hand toward 
israel s right hand  and brought them 
near unto him  14and israel  stretched 
out his right hand  and laid it upon 
ephraim s head  who was the younger  
and his left hand upon manasseh s 
head  guiding his hands wittingly  for 
manasseh was the first born 15and he 
blessed joseph  and said  the god 
before whom my fathers ab raham and 
isaac did walk  the god who hath been 
my shepherd all my life long unto this 
day 16the angel who hath redeemed 
me from all evil  bless the lads  and let 
my name be named in them  and the 
name of my fathers abraham and 
isaac  and let them grow in to a 
multitude in the midst of the earth  
17and when joseph saw that his father 
was laying his right hand upon the 
head of ephraim  it displeased him  
and he held up his father s hand  to 
remove it from ephraim s head unto 
manasseh s head  18and joseph sa id 
unto his father  not so  my father  for 
this is the first born put thy right hand 
upon his head  19and his father 
refused  and said  i know it  my son  i 
know it  he also shall become a 
people  and he also shall be great  
howbeit his younger brother  shall be 
greater than he  and his seed shall 
become a multitude of nations  20and 
he blessed them that day  saying  by 
thee shall israel bless  saying  god 
make thee as ephraim and as manasseh  and he set ephraim before 
manasseh  21and israel said unto  
joseph  behold  i die but god will be 
with you  and bring you back unto the 
land of your fathers  22moreover i have 
given to thee one aportion above thy 
brethren  which i took out of the hand 
of the amorite with my sword and 
with my bow   
 
and jacob  called unto his 
sons and said  gather 
yourselves together  that i may tell you 
that which shall befall you in the end 
of days   
2assemble yourselves  and hear  ye 
sons of jacob   
and hearken unto israel your father   
3reuben  thou art my first born  
my might  and the first fruits of my 
strength   
the excellency of dignity  and the 
excellency of power

father s bed

to my couch   
 
5simeon  and levi are brethren   
weapons of violence their kinship   
6let my soul not come into their 
council

i will divide them in jacob

 23the archers have dealt bitterly 
with him   
and shot at him  and hated him   
24but his bow abode firm   
and the arms of his hands were 
made supple   
by the hands of the mighty one of 
jacob   
from thence  from the shepherd  the 
stone of israel   
25even by the god of thy father  
who shall help thee   
and by the almighty  who shall

27benjamin is a wolf that raveneth   
in the morning he devoureth the 
prey  
and at even he divideth the spoil   
 
28all these are the twelve tribes of 
israel and this is it that their father 
spoke unto them and blessed them  
every one according to his blessing he 
blessed them  29and be charged them  
and said unto them  i am to be gathered unto my people  bury me 
with my fathers in the cave that is in 
the field of ephron the hittite  30in the 
cave that is in the field of machpelah  
which is before mamre  in the land of 
canaan  which abraham bought with 
the field from ephron the hittite for a 
possession of a burying place  31there 
they buried abraham and sar ah his 
wife there they buried isaac and 
rebekah his wife  and there i buried 
leah  32the field and the cave that is 
therein  which was purchased from the 
children of heth  33and when jacob 
made an end of charging his sons  he 
gathered up his feet into th e bed  and 
expired  and was gathered unto his 
people   
and joseph fell upon his 
father s face  and wept upon 
him and kissed him  2and joseph 
commanded his servants the 
physicians to embalm his father  and 
the physicians embalmed israel  3and 
forty days  were fulfilled for him  for 
so are fulfilled the days of embalming  
and the egyptians wept for him 
threescore and ten days   
4and when the days of weeping for 
him were past  joseph spoke unto the 
house of pharaoh  saying  if now i 
have found favour in yo ur eyes  speak  
i pray you  in the ears of pharaoh  
saying  5my father made me swear  
saying  lo i die in my grave which i 
have digged for me in the land of 
canaan  there shalt thou bury me  now 
therefore let me go up  i pray thee  and 
bury my father  and i will come back  50 genesis  
74 
 6and pharaoh said  go up  and bury 
thy father  according as he made thee 
swear  7and joseph went up to bury 
his father  and with him went up all 
the servants of pharaoh  the elders of 
his house  and all the elders of the land 
of egyp t 8and all the house of joseph  
and his brethren  and his father s 
house  only their little ones  and their 
flocks  and their herds  they left in the 
land of goshen  9and there went up 
with him both chariots and horsemen  
and it was a very great company  
10and they came to the threshing floor 
of atad  which is beyond the jordan  
and there they wailed with a very great 
and sore wailing  and he made a 
mourning for his father seven days  
11and when the inhabitants of the land  
the canaanites  saw the mourning  in 
the floor of atad  they said  this is a 
grievous amourning to the egyptians  
wherefore the name of it was called 
abel mizraim  which is beyond the 
jordan  12and his sons did unto him 
according as he commanded them  
13for his sons carried him into the  land 
of canaan  and buried him in the cave 
of the field of machpelah  which 
abraham bought with the field  for a 
possession of a burying place  of 
ephron the hittite  in front of mamre   
14and joseph returned into egypt  
he and his brethren  and all that  went 
up with him to bury his father  after he 
had buried his father  15and when 
joseph s brethren saw that their father 
                                                      
a heb ebel was dead  they said  it may be that 
joseph will hate us  and will fully 
requite us all the evil which we did 
unto him  16and they sen t a message 
unto joseph  saying  thy father did 
command before he died  saying  17so 
shall ye say unto joseph  forgive  i 
pray thee now  the transgression of thy 
brethren  and their sin  for that they did 
unto thee evil  and now  we pray thee  
forgive the  transgression of the 
servants of the god of thy father  and 
joseph wept when they spoke unto 
him 18and his brethren also went and 
fell down before his face  and they 
said behold  we are thy bondmen  
19and joseph said unto them  fear 
not for am i in  the place of god  
20and as for you  ye meant evil against 
me but god meant it for good  to 
bring to pass  as it is this day  to save 
much people alive  21now therefore 
fear ye not  i will sustain you  and 
your little ones  and he comforted 
them  and spo ke kindly unto them   
22and joseph dwelt in egypt  he 
and his father s house  and joseph 
lived a hundred and ten years  23and 
joseph saw ephraim s children of the 
third generation  the children also of 
machir the son of manasseh were born 
upon joseph s kn ees 24and joseph 
said unto his brethren  i die  but god 
will surely remember you  and bring 
you up out of this land unto the land 
which he swore to abraham  to isaac  
and to jacob  25and joseph took an 
oath of the children of israel  saying  
god will s urely remember you  and genesis  
75 
 ye shall carry up my bones from 
hence  26so joseph died  being a 
hundred and ten years old  and they embalmed him  and he was put in a 
coffin in egypt   
  
76 
  
exodus 
 
now these are the names of the 
sons of israel  who came into 
egypt with jacob  every man came 
with his household  2reuben  simeon  
levi and judah  3issachar  zebulun  
and benjamin  4dan and naphtali  gad 
and asher  5and all the souls that 
came out of the loins of jacob were 
seventy souls  and joseph was in 
egypt already  6and joseph died  and 
all his brethren  and all that generation  
7and the children of israel were 
fruitful  and increased abundantly  and 
multiplied  and waxed exceeding 
mighty and the land was filled with 
them   
 
8now there arose a new king over 
egypt  who knew not joseph  9and he 
said unto his people  behold  the 
people of the children of israel are too 
many and too mighty for us  10come  
let us deal wisely with them  lest they 
multiply  and it come to pass  that 
when there befalleth us any war  they 
also join themselves unto our enemies  
and fight against us  and get them up 
out of the land  11therefore they did 
set over them taskmasters to afflict 
them with their burd ens and they 
built for pharaoh store cities  pithom 
and raamses  12but the more they 
afflicted them  the more they 
multiplied and the more they spread abroad  and they were adread because 
of the children of israel  13and the 
egyptians made the children of  israel 
to serve with rigour  14and they made 
their lives bitter with hard service  in 
mortar and in brick  and in all manner 
of service in the field  in all their 
service  wherein they made them serve 
with rigour   
15and the king of egypt spoke to the 
hebrew midwives  of whom the name 
of the one was shiphrah  and the name 
of the other puah  16and he said  
when ye do the office of a midwife to 
the hebrew women  ye shall look upon 
the birthstool  if it be a son  then ye 
shall kill him  but if it be a daught er 
then she shall live  17but the 
midwives feared god  and did not as 
the king of egypt commanded them  
but saved the men children alive  
18and the king of egypt called for the 
midwives  and said unto them  why 
have ye done this thing  and have 
saved th e men children alive  19and 
the midwives said unto pharaoh  
because the hebrew women are not 
as the egyptian women  for they are 
lively  and are delivered ere the 
midwife come unto them  20and god 
dealt well with the midwives  and the 
people multiplied  and waxed very 
mighty  21and it came to pass  because 
the midwives feared god  that he 1 exodus 
77 
 made them houses  22and pharaoh 
charged all his people  saying  every 
son that is born ye shall cast into the 
river  and every daughter ye shall save 
alive   
and th ere went a man of the 
house of levi  and took to wife a 
daughter of levi  2and the woman 
conceived  and bore a son  and when 
she saw him that he was a goodly 
child  she hid him three months  3and 
when she could not longer hide him  
she took for him an ark of bulrushes  
and daubed it with slime and with 
pitch  and she put the child therein  
and laid it in the flags by the river s 
brink  4and his sister stood afar off  to 
know what would be done to him  
5and the daughter of pharaoh came 
down to bathe in the r iver and her 
maidens walked along by the river 
side and she saw the ark among the 
flags  and sent her handmaid to fetch 
it 6and she opened it  and saw it  even 
the child  and behold a boy that wept  
and she had compassion on him  and 
said this is one of the 
hebrews children  7then said his 
sister to pharaoh s daughter  shall i 
go and call thee a nurse of the hebrew 
women  that she may nurse the child 
for thee  8and pharaoh s daughter 
said to her  go and the maiden went 
and called the child s moth er 9and 
pharaoh s daughter said unto her  
take this child away  and nurse it for 
me and i will give thee thy wages  
and the woman took the child  and 
nursed it  10and the child grew  and she brought him unto pharaoh s 
daughter  and he became her son  and 
she called his name amoses  and said  
because i bdrew him out of the 
water   
11and it came to pass in those days  
when moses was grown up  that he 
went out unto his brethren  and looked 
on their burdens  and he saw an 
egyptian smiting a hebrew  one of  his 
brethren  12and he looked this way and 
that way  and when he saw that there 
was no man  he smote the egyptian  
and hid him in the sand  13and he went 
out the second day  and behold  two 
men of the hebrews were striving 
together  and he said to him th at did 
the wrong  wherefore smitest thou 
thy fellow  14and he said  who 
made thee a ruler and a judge over us  
thinkest thou to kill me  as thou didst 
kill the egyptian  and moses feared  
and said  surely the thing is known  
15now when pharaoh heard this thing  
he sought to slay moses  but moses 
fled from the face of pharaoh  and 
dwelt in the land of midian  and he sat 
down by a well  16now the priest of 
midian had seven daughters  and they 
came and drew water  and filled the 
troughs to water their fa thers flock  
17and the shepherds came and drove 
them away  but moses stood up and 
helped them  and watered their flock  
18and when they came to reuel their 
father  he said  how is it that ye are 
                                                      
a heb mosheh 
b heb mashah  to draw out  2 exodus 
78 
 come so soon to day 19and they 
said an egyptian deliver ed us out of 
the hand of the shepherds  and 
moreover he drew water for us  and 
watered the flock  20and he said unto 
his daughters  and where is he  why 
is it that ye have left the man  call 
him that he may eat bread  21and 
moses was content to dwell w ith the 
man and he gave moses zipporah his 
daughter  22and she bore a son  and he 
called his name gershom  for he said  
i have been aa stranger in a strange 
land  
 
23and it came to pass in the course 
of those many days that the king of 
egypt died  and the children of israel 
sighed by reason of the bondage  and 
they cried  and their cry came up unto 
god by reason of the bondage  24and 
god heard their groaning  and god 
remembered his covenant with 
abraham  with isaac  and with jacob  
25and god saw the chi ldren of israel  
and god took cognizance of them   
now moses was keeping the 
flock of jethro his father inlaw 
the priest of midian  and he led the 
flock to the farthest end of the 
wilderness  and came to the mountain 
of god  unto horeb  2and the angel of 
the lord appeared unto him in a flame 
of fire out of the midst of a bush  and 
he looked  and behold  the bush 
burned with fire  and the bush was not 
consumed  3and moses said  i will 
                                                      
a heb ger turn aside now  and see this great 
sight  why the bush is not burnt  4and 
when the lord saw that he turned 
aside to see  god called unto him out 
of the midst of the bush  and said  
moses  moses  and he said  here 
am i  5and he said  draw not nigh 
hither  put off thy shoes from off thy 
feet for the place whereon thou  
standest is holy ground  6moreover 
he said  i am the god of thy father  
the god of abraham  the god of isaac  
and the god of jacob  and moses hid 
his face  for he was afraid to look upon 
god 7and the lord said i have 
surely seen the affliction of my  people 
that are in egypt  and have heard their 
cry by reason of their taskmasters  for 
i know their pains  8and i am come 
down to deliver them out of the hand 
of the egyptians  and to bring them up 
out of that land unto a good land and a 
large  unto a lan d flowing with milk 
and honey  unto the place of the 
canaanite  and the hittite  and the 
amorite  and the perizzite  and the 
hivite  and the jebusite  9and now  
behold  the cry of the children of israel 
is come unto me  moreover i have 
seen the oppression wherewith the 
egyptians oppress them  10come now 
therefore  and i will send thee unto 
pharaoh  that thou mayest bring forth 
my people the children of israel out of 
egypt  11and moses said unto god  
who am i  that i should go unto 
pharaoh  and that i shou ld bring forth 
the children of israel out of egypt  
12and he said  certainly i will be 3 exodus 
79 
 with thee  and this shall be the token 
unto thee  that i have sent thee  when 
thou hast brought forth the people out 
of egypt  ye shall serve god upon this 
mountain  13and moses said unto 
god behold  when i come unto the 
children of israel  and shall say unto 
them  the god of your fathers hath 
sent me unto you  and they shall say to 
me what is his name  what shall i 
say unto them  14and god said unto 
moses  i am t hat i am  and he 
said thus shalt thou say unto the 
children of israel  i am hath sent me 
unto you  15and god said moreover 
unto moses  thus shalt thou say unto 
the children of israel  the lord the 
god of your fathers  the god of 
abraham  the god of i saac and the 
god of jacob  hath sent me unto you  
this is my name for ever  and this is 
my memorial unto all generations  
16go and gather the elders of israel 
together  and say unto them  the lord 
the god of your fathers  the god of 
abraham  of isaac  and of jacob  hath 
appeared unto me  saying  i have 
surely remembered you  and seen that 
which is done to you in egypt  17and i 
have said  i will bring you up out of 
the affliction of egypt unto the land of 
the canaanite  and the hittite  and the 
amorite  and the perizzite  and the 
hivite  and the jebusite  unto a land 
flowing with milk and honey  18and 
they shall hearken to thy voice  and 
thou shalt come  thou and the elders of 
israel  unto the king of egypt  and ye 
shall say unto him  the lord the god of the hebrews  hath met with us  and 
now let us go  we pray thee  three 
daysjourney into the wilderness  that 
we may sacrifice to the lord our god  
19and i know that the king of egypt 
will not give you leave to go  except 
by a mighty hand  20and i will put 
forth my hand  and smite egypt with 
all my wonders which i will do in the 
midst thereof  and after that he will let 
you go  21and i will give this people 
favour in the sight of the egyptians  
and it shall come to pass  that when 
ye go  ye shall not go emp ty 22but 
every woman shall ask of her 
neighbour  and of her that sojourneth 
in her house  jewels of silver  and 
jewels of gold  and raiment  and ye 
shall put them upon your sons  and 
upon your daughters  and ye shall 
spoil the egyptians   
and moses ans wered and said  
but behold  they will not believe 
me nor hearken unto my voice  for 
they will say  the lord hath not 
appeared unto thee  2and the lord 
said unto him  what is that in thy 
hand  and he said  a rod  3and he 
said cast it on the ground  and he 
cast it on the ground  and it became a 
serpent  and moses fled from before it  
4and the lord said unto moses  put 
forth thy hand  and take it by the tail 
and he put forth his hand  and laid hold 
of it and it became a rod in his hand  
5that they  may believe that the lord 
the god of their fathers  the god of 
abraham  the god of isaac  and the 
god of jacob  hath appeared unto 4 exodus 
80 
 thee 6and the lord said furthermore 
unto him  put now thy hand into thy 
bosom  and he put his hand into his 
bosom  and when he took it out  
behold  his hand was leprous  as white 
as snow  7and he said  put thy hand 
back into thy bosom and he put his 
hand back into his bosom  and when 
he took it out of his bosom  behold  it 
was turned again as his other flesh  
8and it sh all come to pass  if they will 
not believe thee  neither hearken to the 
voice of the first sign  that they will 
believe the voice of the latter sign  
9and it shall come to pass  if they will 
not believe even these two signs  
neither hearken unto thy voice  that 
thou shalt take of the water of the 
river  and pour it upon the dry land  
and the water which thou takest out of 
the river shall become blood upon the 
dry land  10and moses said unto the 
lord oh lord  i am not a man of 
words  neither heretofore  nor since 
thou hast spoken unto thy servant  
for i am slow of speech  and of a slow 
tongue  11and the lord said unto him  
who hath made man s mouth  or who 
maketh a man dumb  or deaf  or 
seeing  or blind  is it not i the lord 
12now therefore go  and i wi ll be with 
thy mouth  and teach thee what thou 
shalt speak  13and he said  oh lord  
send i pray thee  by the hand of him 
whom thou wilt send  14and the 
anger of the lord was kindled against 
moses  and he said  is there not 
aaron thy brother the levite  i know 
that he can speak well  and also  behold  he cometh forth to meet thee  
and when he seeth thee  he will be glad 
in his heart  15and thou shalt speak 
unto him  and put the words in his 
mouth  and i will be with thy mouth  
and with his mouth  and wi ll teach you 
what ye shall do  16and he shall be thy 
spokesman unto the people  and it 
shall come to pass  that he shall be to 
thee a mouth  and thou shalt be to him 
in god s stead  17and thou shalt take 
in thy hand this rod  wherewith thou 
shalt do the si gns  
18and moses went and returned to 
ajethro his father inlaw and said unto 
him let me go  i pray thee  and unto 
my brethren that are in egypt  and see 
whether they be yet alive  and jethro 
said to moses  go in peace  19and 
the lord said unto mos es in midian  
go return into egypt  for all the men 
are dead that sought thy life  20and 
moses took his wife and his sons  and 
set them upon an ass  and he returned 
to the land of egypt  and moses took 
the rod of god in his hand  21and the 
lord said unt o moses  when thou 
goest back into egypt  see that thou do 
before pharaoh all the wonders which 
i have put in thy hand  but i will 
harden his heart  and he will not let the 
people go  22and thou shalt say unto 
pharaoh  thus saith the lord israel is 
my so n my first born 23and i have 
said unto thee  let my son go  that he 
may serve me  and thou hast refused 
to let him go  behold  i will slay thy 
                                                      
a heb jether  exodus 
81 
 son thy first born 24and it came to 
pass on the way at the lodging place  
that the lord met him  and sought  to 
kill him  25then zipporah took a flint  
and cut off the foreskin of her son  and 
cast it at his feet  and she said  surely 
a bridegroom of blood art thou to me  
26so he let him alone  then she said  
a bridegroom of blood in regard of 
the circumcisio n  
27and the lord said to aaron  go 
into the wilderness to meet moses  
and he went  and met him in the 
mountain of god  and kissed him  
28and moses told aaron all the words 
of the lord wherewith he had sent 
him and all the signs wherewith he 
had charg ed him  29and moses and 
aaron went and gathered together all 
the elders of the children of israel  
30and aaron spoke all the words 
which the lord had spoken unto 
moses  and did the signs in the sight of 
the people  31and the people believed  
and when they heard that the lord had 
remembered the children of israel  and 
that he had seen their affliction  then 
they bowed their heads and 
worshipped   
and afterward moses and aaron 
came  and said unto pharaoh  
thus saith the lord the god of 
israel  let my peop le go  that they 
may hold a feast unto me in the 
wilderness  2and pharaoh said  who 
is the lord that i should hearken unto 
his voice to let israel go  i know not 
the lord and moreover i will not let 
israel go  3and they said  the god of the hebrews h ath met with us  let us 
go we pray thee  three days journey 
into the wilderness  and sacrifice unto 
the lord our god  lest he fall upon us 
with pestilence  or with the sword  
4and the king of egypt said unto them  
wherefore do ye  moses and aaron  
cause  the people to break loose from 
their work  get you unto your 
burdens  5and pharaoh said  behold  
the people of the land are now many  
and will ye make them rest from their 
burdens  6and the same day pharaoh 
commanded the taskmasters of the 
people  and their officers  saying  7ye 
shall no more give the people straw to 
make brick  as heretofore  let them go 
and gather straw for themselves  8and 
the tale of the bricks  which they did 
make heretofore  ye shall lay upon 
them  ye shall not diminish aught 
thereof for they are idle  therefore 
they cry  saying  let us go and 
sacrifice to our god  9let heavier work 
be laid upon the men  that they may 
labour therein  and let them not regard 
lying words  10and the taskmasters of 
the people went out  and their off icers  
and they spoke to the people  saying  
thus saith pharaoh  i will not give 
you straw  11go yourselves  get you 
straw where ye can find it  for nought 
of your work shall be diminished  
12so the people were scattered abroad 
throughout all the land of  egypt to 
gather stubble for straw  13and the 
taskmasters were urgent  saying  
fulfil your work  your daily task  as 
when there was straw  14and the 5 exodus 
82 
 officers of the children of israel  whom 
pharaoh s taskmasters had set over 
them  were beaten  saying  wherefore 
have ye not fulfilled your appointed 
task in making brick both yesterday 
and today as heretofore  15then the 
officers of the children of israel came 
and cried unto pharaoh  saying  
wherefore dealest thou thus with thy 
servants  16there is no str aw given 
unto thy servants  and they say to us  
make brick  and behold  thy servants 
are beaten  but the fault is in thine own 
people  17but he said  ye are idle  ye 
are idle  therefore ye say  let us go 
and sacrifice to the lord 18go 
therefore now  and work  for there 
shall no straw be given you  yet shall 
ye deliver the tale of bricks  19and the 
officers of the children of israel did 
see that they were set on mischief  
when they said  ye shall not diminish 
aught from your bricks  your daily 
task 20and they met moses and 
aaron  who stood in the way  as they 
came forth from pharaoh  21and they 
said unto them  the lord look upon 
you and judge  because ye have made 
our savour to be abhorred in the eyes 
of pharaoh  and in the eyes of his 
servants  to put a sword in their hand 
to slay us  22and moses returned unto 
the lord and said  lord  wherefore 
hast thou dealt ill with this people  
why is it that thou hast sent me  23for 
since i came to pharaoh to speak in 
thy name  he hath dealt ill with this 
people neither hast thou delivered 
thy people at all   and the lord said unto moses  
now shalt thou see what i will 
do to pharaoh  for by a strong hand 
shall he let them go  and by a strong 
hand shall he drive them out of his 
land  
 
2and god spoke  unto moses  and 
said unto him  i am the lord 3and i 
appeared unto abraham  unto isaac  
and unto jacob  as god almighty  but 
by my name  a i made me not 
known to them  4and i have also 
established my covenant with them  to 
give them the land of canaan  the land 
of their sojournings  wherein they 
sojourned  5and moreover i have 
heard the groaning of the children of 
israel  whom the egyptians keep in 
bondage  and i have remembered my 
covenant  6wherefore say unto the 
children of israel  i am the lord and i 
will bring you out from under the 
burdens of the egyptians  and i will 
deliver you from their bondage  and i 
will redeem you with an outstretched 
arm and with great judgments  7and i 
will take you to me for a people  and i 
will be to you a god  and ye  shall 
know that i am the lord your god  
who brought you out from under the 
burdens of the egyptians  8and i will 
bring you in unto the land  concerning 
which i lifted up my hand to give it to 
abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  and i 
will give it you for a h eritage  i am the

which means the lord  6 exodus 
83 
 lord 9and moses spoke so unto the 
children of israel  but they hearkened 
not unto moses for impatience of 
spirit  and for cruel bondage   
10and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  11go in  speak unto pharaoh 
king of egypt  that he let t he children 
of israel go out of his land  12and 
moses spoke before the lord saying  
behold  the children of israel have not 
hearkened unto me  how then shall 
pharaoh hear me  who am of 
uncircumcised lips   
13and the lord spoke unto moses 
and unto aaron  and gave them a 
charge unto the children of israel  and 
unto pharaoh king of egypt  to bring 
the children of israel out of the land of 
egypt

unto moses in the land of e gypt 29that 
the lord spoke unto moses  saying  i 
am the lord speak thou unto pharaoh 
king of egypt all that i speak unto 
thee 30and moses said before the 
lord behold  i am of uncircumcised 
lips and how shall pharaoh hearken  exodus 
84 
 unto me  1and the lord said 
unto moses  see i have set thee 
in god s stead to pharaoh  and aaron

shalt speak all that i command thee  
and aaron thy brother shall speak unto

out of the land of egyp t by great 
judgments  5and the egyptians shall

did so  as the lord commanded them  
so did they  7and moses was fo urscore 
years old  and aaron fourscore and 
three years old  when they spoke unto 
pharaoh   
 
8and the lord spoke unto moses 
and unto aaron  saying  9when 
pharaoh shall speak unto you  saying  
show a wonder for you  then thou 
shalt say unto aaron  take thy rod 
and cast it down before pharaoh  that it 
become a serpent  10and moses and 
aaron went in unto pharaoh  and they 
did so  as the lord had commanded  
and aaron cast down his rod before 
pharaoh and before his servants  and it 
became a serpent  11then pha raoh also 
called for the wise men and the sorcerers  and they also  the magicians 
of egypt  did in like manner with their 
secret arts  12for they cast down every 
man his rod  and they became 
serpents  but aaron s rod swallowed 
up their rods  13and pharaoh s heart 
was hardened  and he hearkened not 
unto them  as the lord had spoken   
14and the lord said unto moses  
pharaoh s heart is stubborn  he 
refuseth to let the people go  15get thee 
unto pharaoh in the morning  lo he 
goeth out unto the water  and thou  
shalt stand by the river s brink to meet 
him and the rod which was turned to a 
serpent shalt thou take in thy hand  
16and thou shalt say unto him  the 
lord the god of the hebrews  hath 
sent me unto thee  saying  let my 
people go  that they may serve me in 
the wilderness  and behold  hitherto 
thou hast not hearkened  17thus saith 
the lord in this thou shalt know that i 
am the l ordbehold  i will smite 
with the rod that is in my hand upon 
the waters which are in the river  and 
they shall be turned to blo od 18and

and the river shall become foul  and 
the egyptians shall loathe to drink 
water from the river   
19and the lord said unto moses  
say unto aaron  take thy rod  and 
stretch out thy hand over the waters of

streams  and over their pools  and over 
all their ponds of water  that they may

blood throughout all the land of egypt  7 exodus 
85

of stone  20and moses and aaron did

lifted up the rod  and smote the waters 
that were in the river  in the sight of

servants  and all the waters that were 
in the river were turned to blood

manner with their secret arts  and 
pharaoh s heart was harden ed and he 
hearkened not unto them  as the lord 
had spoken  23and pharaoh turned and 
went into his house  neither did he lay 
even this to heart  24and all the 
egyptians digged round about the river 
for water to drink  for they could not 
drink of the water of the river  25and 
seven days were fulfilled  after that the 
lord had smitten the river  26and the 
lord spoke unto moses  go in unto 
pharaoh  and say unto him  thus saith 
the lord let my people go  that they 
may serve me  27and if thou refuse to 
let the m go  behold  i will smite all thy 
borders with frogs  28and the river 
shall swarm with frogs  which shall go 
up and come into thy house  and into 
thy bed chamber  and upon thy bed  
and into the house of thy servants  and 
upon thy people  and into thine ov ens 
and into thy kneading troughs  29and 
the frogs shall come up both upon 
thee and upon thy people  and upon  all thy  servants  1and the lord 
said unto moses  say unto 
aaron  stretch forth thy hand with thy 
rod over the rivers  over the canals  
and over the pools  and cause frogs to 
come up upon the land of egypt  2and 
aaron stretched out his hand over the 
waters of egypt  and the frogs came 
up and covered the land of egypt  
3and the magicians did in like manner 
with their secret arts  and brought up 
frogs upon the land of egypt  4then 
pharaoh called for moses and aaron  
and said  entreat the lord that he 
take away the frogs from me  and from 
my people  and i will let the people go  
that they may sacrifice unto the lord 
5and moses said unto phar aoh have 
thou this glory over me  against what 
time shall i entreat for thee  and for thy 
servants  and for thy people  that the 
frogs be destroyed from thee and thy 
houses  and remain in the river only  
6and he said  against to morrow  
and he said  be it according to thy 
word  that thou mayest know that there 
is none like unto the lord our god  
7and the frogs shall depart from thee  
and from thy houses  and from thy 
servants  and from thy people  they 
shall remain in the river only  8and 
moses and a aron went out from 
pharaoh  and moses cried unto the 
lord concerning the frogs  which he 
had brought upon pharaoh  9and the 
lord did according to the word of 
moses  and the frogs died out of the 
houses  out of the courts  and out of 
the fields  10and they gathered them 8 exodus 
86 
 together in heaps  and the land stank  
11but when pharaoh saw that there was 
respite  he hardened his heart  and 
hearkened not unto them  as the lord 
had spoken  12and the lord said unto 
moses  say unto aaron  stretch out 
thy rod  and smite the dust of the earth  
that it may become gnats throughout 
all the land of egypt  13and they did 
so and aaron stretched out his hand 
with his rod  and smote the dust of the 
earth  and there were gnats upon man  
and upon beast  all the dust of the 
earth b ecame gnats throughout all the 
land of egypt  14and the magicians did 
so with their secret arts to bring forth 
gnats  but they could not  and there 
were gnats upon man  and upon beast  
15then the magicians said unto 
pharaoh  this is the finger of god  
and pharaoh s heart was hardened  and 
he hearkened not unto them  as the 
lord had spoken   
16and the lord said unto moses  
rise up early in the morning  and 
stand before pharaoh  lo he cometh 
forth to the water  and say unto him  
thus saith the lord let m y people 
go that they may serve me  17else if 
thou wilt not let my people go  behold  
i will send swarms of flies upon thee  
and upon thy servants  and upon thy 
people  and into thy houses  and the 
houses of the egyptians shall be full of 
swarms of flies  and also the ground 
whereon they are  18and i will set 
apart in that day the land of goshen  in 
which my people dwell  that no 
swarms of flies shall be there  to the end that thou mayest know that i am 
the lord in the midst of the earth  
19and i will put  a division between my 
people and thy people by to morrow 
shall this sign be  20and the lord did 
so and there came grievous swarms of 
flies into the house of pharaoh  and 
into his servants houses  and in all the 
land of egypt the land was ruined by 
reaso n of the swarms of flies  21and 
pharaoh called for moses and for 
aaron  and said  go ye  sacrifice to 
your god in the land  22and moses 
said it is not meet so to do  for we 
shall sacrifice the abomination of the 
egyptians to the lord our god  lo if 
we sacrifice the abomination of the 
egyptians before their eyes  will they 
not stone us  23we will go three 
daysjourney into the wilderness  and 
sacrifice to the lord our god  as he 
shall command us  24and pharaoh 
said i will let you go  that ye may 
sacrifice to the lord your god in the 
wilderness  only ye shall not go very 
far away  entreat for me  25and moses 
said behold  i go out from thee  and i 
will entreat the lord that the swarms 
of flies may depart from pharaoh  from 
his servants  and from his people  
tomorrow  only let not pharaoh deal 
deceitfully any more in not letting the 
people go to sacrifice to the lord 
26and moses went out from pharaoh  
and entreated the lord 27and the 
lord did according to the word of 
moses  and he removed the swarms  of 
flies from pharaoh  from his servants  
and from his people  there remained exodus 
87 
 not one  28and pharaoh hardened his 
heart this time also  and he did not let 
the people go   
 
then the lord said unto moses  
go in unto pharaoh  and tell him  
thus saith the lord the god of the 
hebrews  let my people go  that they 
may serve me  2for if thou refuse to 
let them go  and wilt hold them still  
3behold  the hand of the lord is upon 
thy cattle which are in the field  upon 
the horses  upon the asses  upon the 
camels  upon the herds  and upon the 
flocks  there shall be a very grievous 
murrain  4and the lord shall make a 
division between the cattle of israel 
and the cattle of egypt  and there shall 
nothing die of all that belongeth to the 
children of israel  5and the lord 
appointed a set time  saying  
tomorrow the lord shall do this 
thing in the land  6and the lord did 
that thing on the morrow  and all the 
cattle of egypt died  but of the cattle 
of the children of israel died not one  
7and pharaoh sent  and behold  there 
was not so much as one of the cattle of 
the israelites dead  but the heart of 
pharaoh was stubborn  and he did not 
let the people go   
8and the lord said unto moses and 
unto aaron  take to you handfuls of 
soot of the furnace  and let moses 
throw it h eavenward in the sight of 
pharaoh  9and it shall become small 
dust over all the land of egypt  and 
shall be a boil breaking forth with 
blains upon man and upon beast  throughout all the land of egypt  
10and they took soot of the furnace  
and stood before pharaoh  and moses 
threw it up heavenward  and it became 
a boil breaking forth with blains upon 
man and upon beast  11and the 
magicians could not stand before 
moses because of the boils  for the 
boils were upon the magicians  and 
upon all the egyptians  12and the lord 
hardened the heart of pharaoh  and he 
hearkened not unto them  as the lord 
had spoken unto moses   
13and the lord said unto moses  
rise up early in the morning  and 
stand before pharaoh  and say unto 
him thus saith the lord the god of 
the h ebrews  let my people go  that 
they may serve me  14for i will this 
time send all my plagues upon thy 
person  and upon thy servants  and 
upon thy people  that thou mayest 
know that there is none like me in all 
the earth  15surely now i had put forth 
my han d and smitten thee and thy 
people with pestilence  and thou hadst 
been cut off from the earth  16but in 
very deed for this cause have i made 
thee to stand  to show thee my power  
and that my name may be declared 
throughout all the earth  17as yet 
exaltest  thou thyself against my 
people  that thou wilt not let them go  
18behold  tomorrow about this time i 
will cause it to rain a very grievous 
hail such as hath not been in egypt 
since the day it was founded even until 
now 19now therefore send  hasten in 
thy cattle and all that thou hast in the 9 exodus 
88 
 field for every man and beast that 
shall be found in the field  and shall 
not be brought home  the hail shall 
come down upon them  and they shall 
die 20he that feared the word of the 
lord among the servants of phar aoh 
made his servants and his cattle flee 
into the houses  21and he that regarded 
not the word of the lord left his 
servants and his cattle in the field   
22and the lord said unto moses  
stretch forth thy hand toward heaven  
that there may be hail in all the land of 
egypt  upon man  and upon beast  and 
upon every herb of the field  
throughout the land of egypt  23and 
moses stretched forth his rod toward 
heaven  and the lord sent thunder and 
hail and fire ran down unto the earth  
and the lord caused to ha il upon the 
land of egypt  24so there was hail  and 
fire flashing up amidst the hail  very 
grievous  such as had not been in all 
the land of egypt since it became a 
nation  25and the hail smote 
throughout all the land of egypt all 
that was in the field  both man and 
beast  and the hail smote every herb of 
the field  and broke every tree of the 
field 26only in the land of goshen  
where the children of israel were  was 
there no hail  27and pharaoh sent  and 
called for moses and aaron  and said 
unto them  i have sinned this time  the 
lord is righteous  and i and my people 
are wicked  28entreat the lord and let 
there be enough of these mighty 
thunderings and hail  and i will let you 
go and ye shall stay no longer  29and moses said unto him  as soon as i am  
gone out of the city  i will spread forth 
my hands unto the lord the thunders 
shall cease  neither shall there be any 
more hail  that thou mayest know that 
the earth is the l ords 30but as for 
thee and thy servants  i know that ye 
will not yet fear the lord god 
31and the flax and the barley were 
smitten  for the barley was in the ear  
and the flax was in bloom  32but the 
wheat and the spelt were not smitten  
for they ripen late  33and moses 
went out of the city from pharaoh  and 
spread forth his hand s unto the lord 
and the thunders and hail ceased  and 
the rain was not poured upon the earth  
34and when pharaoh saw that the rain 
and the hail and the thunders were 
ceased  he sinned yet more  and 
hardened his heart  he and his servants  
35and the heart of pharaoh was 
hardened  and he did not let the 
children of israel go  as the lord had 
spoken by moses   
 
 
and the lord said unto 
moses  go in unto pharaoh  
for i have hardened his heart  and the 
heart of his servants  that i might show 
these my signs in the midst of them  
2and that thou mayest tell in the ears of 
thy son  and of thy son s son  what i 
have wrought upon egypt  and my 
signs which i have done among them  
that ye may know that i am the lord 
3and moses and aaron went in unto 
pharaoh  and said unto him  thus 10 exodus 
89 
 saith the lord the god of the 
hebrews  how long wilt thou refuse to 
humble thyself before me  let my 
people go  that they may serve me  
4else if thou refuse to let my people 
go behold  tomorrow will i bring 
locusts into thy border  5and they shall 
cover the face of the earth  that one 
shall not be able to see the earth  and 
they shall  eat the residue of that which 
is escaped  which remaineth unto you 
from the hail  and shall eat every tree 
which groweth for you out of the field  
6and thy houses shall be filled  and the 
houses of all thy servants  and the 
houses of all the egyptians  as neither 
thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have 
seen since the day that they were upon 
the earth unto this day  and he turned  
and went out from pharaoh  7and 
pharaoh s servants said unto him  
how long shall this man be a snare 
unto us  let the men go  that they may 
serve the lord their god  knowest 
thou not yet that egypt is destroyed  
8and moses and aaron were brought 
again unto pharaoh  and he said unto 
them  go serve the lord your god  
but who are they that shall go  9and 
moses said  we will g o with our 
young and with our old  with our sons 
and with our daughters  with our 
flocks and with our herds we will go  
for we must hold a feast unto the 
lord 10and he said unto them  so be 
the lord with you  as i will let you go  
and your little ones  see ye that evil is 
before your face  11not so  go now ye 
that are men  and serve the lord for that is what ye desire  and they were 
driven out from pharaoh s presence   
12and the lord said unto moses  
stretch out thy hand over the land of 
egypt for the  locusts  that they may 
come up upon the land of egypt  and 
eat every herb of the land  even all that 
the hail hath left  13and moses 
stretched forth his rod over the land of 
egypt  and the lord brought an east 
wind upon the land all that day  and all 
the night  and when it was morning  
the east wind brought the locusts  
14and the locusts went up over all the 
land of egypt  and rested in all the 
borders of egypt  very grievous were 
they before them there were no such 
locusts as they  neither after them sh all 
be such  15for they covered the face of 
the whole earth  so that the land was 
darkened  and they did eat every herb 
of the land  and all the fruit of the trees 
which the hail had left  and there 
remained not any green thing  either 
tree or herb of the field through all the 
land of egypt  16then pharaoh called 
for moses and aaron in haste  and he 
said i have sinned against the lord 
your god  and against you  17now 
therefore forgive  i pray thee  my sin 
only this once  and entreat the lord 
your god  that he may take away from 
me this death only  18and he went out 
from pharaoh  and entreated the lord 
19and the lord turned an exceeding 
strong west wind  which took up the 
locusts  and drove them into the red 
sea there remained not one locust in 
all the border of egypt  20but the lord exodus 
90 
 hardened pharaoh s heart  and he did 
not let the children of israel go   
21and the lord said unto moses  
stretch out thy hand toward heaven  
that there may be darkness over the 
land of egypt  even darkness which 
may be felt  22and moses stretched 
forth his hand toward heaven  and 
there was a thick darkness in all the 
land of egypt three days  23they saw 
not one another  neither rose any from 
his place for three days  but all the 
children of israel had light in their 
dwellin gs 24and pharaoh called unto 
moses  and said  go ye  serve the 
lord only let your flocks and your 
herds be stayed  let your little ones 
also go with you  25and moses said  
thou must also give into our hand 
sacrifices and burnt offerings  that we 
may s acrifice unto the lord our god  
26our cattle also shall go with us  there 
shall not a hoof be left behind  for 
thereof must we take to serve the lord 
our god  and we know not with what 
we must serve the lord until we come 
thither  27but the lord hardened  
pharaoh s heart  and he would not let 
them go  28and pharaoh said unto him  
get thee from me  take heed to 
thyself  see my face no more  for in the 
day thou seest my face thou shalt die  
29and moses said  thou hast spoken 
well i will see thy face agai n no 
more   
 
and the lord said unto 
moses  yet one plague more 
will i bring upon pharaoh  and upon egypt  afterwards he will let you go 
hence  when he shall let you go  he 
shall surely thrust you out hence 
altogether  2speak now in the ears of 
the peo ple and let them ask every man 
of his neighbour  and every woman of 
her neighbour  jewels of silver  and 
jewels of gold  3and the lord gave 
the people favour in the sight of the 
egyptians  moreover the man moses 
was very great in the land of egypt  in 
the sight of pharaoh s servants  and in 
the sight of the people   
4and moses said  thus saith the 
lord about midnight will i go out 
into the midst of egypt  5and all the 
firstborn in the land of egypt shall 
die from the first born of pharaoh that 
sitteth  upon his throne  even unto the 
firstborn of the maid servant that is 
behind the mill  and all the first born 
of cattle  6and there shall be a great 
cry throughout all the land of egypt  
such as there hath been none like it  
nor shall be like it any more  7but 
against any of the children of israel 
shall not a dog whet his tongue  
against man or beast  that ye may 
know how that the lord doth put a 
difference between the egyptians and 
israel  8and all these thy servants shall 
come down unto me  and bow down 
unto me  saying  get thee out  and all 
the people that follow thee  and after 
that i will go out  and he went out 
from pharaoh in hot anger   
9and the lord said unto moses  
pharaoh will not hearken unto you  
that my wonders may be multiplied in 11 exodus 
91 
 the land of egypt  10and moses and 
aaron did all these wonders before 
pharaoh  and the lord hardened 
pharaoh s heart  and he did not let the 
children of israel go out of his land   
and the lord spoke unto 
moses and aaron in the land 
of egypt  saying  2this mon th shall be 
unto you the beginning of months  it 
shall be the first month of the year to 
you 3speak ye unto all the 
congregation of israel  saying  in the 
tenth day of this month they shall take 
to them every man a lamb  according 
to their fathers houses  a lamb for a 
household  4and if the household be 
too little for a lamb  then shall he and 
his neighbour next unto his house take 
one according to the number of the 
souls  according to every man s eating 
ye shall make your count for the lamb  
5your lamb sh all be without blemish  a 
male of the first year  ye shall take it 
from the sheep  or from the goats  6and 
ye shall keep it unto the fourteenth day 
of the same month  and the whole 
assembly of the congregation of israel 
shall kill it at dusk  7and they sha ll 
take of the blood  and put it on the two 
sideposts and on the lintel  upon the 
houses wherein they shall eat it  8and 
they shall eat the flesh in that night  
roast with fire  and unleavened bread  
with bitter herbs they shall eat it  9eat 
not of it raw  nor sodden at all with 
water  but roast with fire  its head with 
its legs and with the inwards thereof  
10and ye shall let nothing of it remain 
until the morning  but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye 
shall burn with fire  11and thus shall 
ye eat it  with your loins girded  your 
shoes on your feet  and your staff in 
your hand  and ye shall eat it in 
haste it is the l ords passover  12for 
i will go through the land of egypt in 
that night  and will smite all the first 
born in the land of egypt  both man 
and beast  and against all the gods of 
egypt i will execute judgments  i am 
the lord 13and the blood shall be to 
you for a token upon the houses where 
ye are  and when i see the blood  i will 
pass over you  and there shall no 
plague be upon you  to destroy you  
when i smite the land of egypt  14and 
this day shall be unto you for a 
memorial  and ye shall keep it a feast 
to the lord throughout your 
generations ye shall keep it a feast by 
an ordinance for ever  15seven days 
shall ye eat unleavened bread  howbeit 
the first day ye shall put away leaven 
out of your houses  for whosoever 
eateth leavened bread from the first 
day until the seventh day  that soul 
shall be cut off from israel  16and in 
the first day there shall be to you a 
holy convocation  and in the seventh 
day a holy convocation  no manner of 
work shall be done in them  save that 
which every man must eat  that only 
may be done by you  17and ye shall 
observe the feast of unleavened bread  
for in this selfsame day have i brought 
your hosts out of the land of egypt  
therefore shall ye observe this day 
throughout your generations by an 12 exodus 
92 
 ordinance for ever  18in the first month  
on the fourteenth day of the month at 
even  ye shall eat unleavened bread  
until the one and twentieth day of the 
mont h at even  19seven days shall 
there be no leaven found in your 
houses  for whosoever eateth that 
which is leavened  that soul shall be 
cut off from the congregation of israel  
whether he be a sojourner  or one that 
is born in the land  20ye shall eat 
nothi ng leavened  in all your 
habitations shall ye eat unleavened 
bread   
21then moses called for all the 
elders of israel  and said unto them  
draw out  and take you lambs 
according to your families  and kill the 
passover lamb  22and ye shall take a 
bunch of  hyssop  and dip it in the 
blood that is in the basin  and strike the 
lintel and the two side posts with the 
blood that is in the basin  and none of 
you shall go out of the door of his 
house until the morning  23for the 
lord will pass through to smite the 
egyptians  and when he seeth the 
blood upon the lintel  and on the two 
sideposts  the lord will pass over the 
door and will not suffer the destroyer 
to come in unto your houses to smite 
you 24and ye shall observe this thing 
for an ordinance to thee and to thy 
sons for ever  25and it shall come to 
pass when ye be come to the land 
which the lord will give you  
according as he hath promised  that ye 
shall keep this service  26and it shall 
come to pass  when your children shall say unto you  what mean ye by  this 
service  27that ye shall say  it is the 
sacrifice of the l ords passover  for 
that he passed over the houses of the 
children of israel in egypt  when he 
smote the egyptians  and delivered our 
houses  and the people bowed the 
head and worshipped  28and the 
children of israel went and did so  as 
the lord had commanded moses and 
aaron  so did they   
29and it came to pass at midnight  
that the lord smote all the firstborn in 
the land of egypt  from the first born 
of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto 
the first born of the captive that was in 
the dungeon  and all the first born of 
cattle  30and pharaoh rose up in the 
night  he and all his servants  and all 
the egyptians  and there was a great 
cry in egypt  for there was not a house 
where there was not on e dead  31and 
he called for moses and aaron by 
night and said  rise up  get you forth 
from among my people  both ye and 
the children of israel  and go  serve the 
lord as ye have said  32take both 
your flocks and your herds  as ye have 
said and be gone  and bless me also  
33and the egyptians were urgent upon 
the people  to send them out of the 
land in haste  for they said  we are all 
dead men  34and the people took their 
dough before it was leavened  their 
kneading troughs being bound up in 
their cloth es upon their shoulders  
35and the children of israel did 
according to the word of moses  and 
they asked of the egyptians jewels of exodus 
93 
 silver  and jewels of gold  and raiment  
36and the lord gave the people favour 
in the sight of the egyptians  so that 
they l et them have what they asked  
and they despoiled the egyptians   
 
37and the children of israel 
journeyed from rameses to succoth  
about six hundred thousand men on 
foot beside children  38and a mixed 
multitude went up also with them  and 
flocks  and herds  even very much 
cattle  39and they baked unleavened 
cakes of the dough which they brought 
forth out of egypt  for it was not 
leavened  because they were thrust out 
of egypt  and could not tarry  neither 
had they prepared for themselves any 
victual  40now the time that the 
children of israel dwelt in egypt was 
four hundred and thirty years  41and it 
came to pass at the end of four 
hundred and thirty years  even the 
selfsame day it came to pass  that all 
the host of the lord went out from the 
land of egypt  42it was a night of 
watching unto the lord for bringing 
them out from the land of egypt  this 
same night is a night of watching unto 
the lord for all the children of israel 
throughout their generations   
43and the lord said unto moses and 
aaron  this is t he ordinance of the 
passover  there shall no alien eat 
thereof  44but every man s servant that 
is bought for money  when thou hast 
circumcised him  then shall he eat 
thereof  45a sojourner and a hired 
servant shall not eat thereof  46in one house shall it be eaten  thou shalt not 
carry forth aught of the flesh abroad 
out of the house  neither shall ye break 
a bone thereof  47all the congregation 
of israel shall keep it  48and when a 
stranger shall sojourn with thee  and 
will keep the passover to the lord let 
all his males be circumcised  and then 
let him come near and keep it  and he 
shall be as one that is born in the land  
but no uncircumcised person shall eat 
thereof  49one law shall be to him that 
is homeborn  and unto the stranger that 
sojourneth among  you 50thus did all 
the children of israel  as the lord 
commanded moses and aaron  so did 
they  
51and it came to pass the selfsame 
day that the lord did bring the 
children of israel out of the land of 
egypt by their hosts   
and the lord spoke unto 
moses saying  2sanctify unto 
me all the first born whatsoever 
openeth the womb among the children 
of israel  both of man and of beast  it is 
mine   
3and moses said unto the people  
remember this day  in which ye came 
out from egypt  out of the house of 
bondage  for by strength of hand the 
lord brought you out from this place  
there shall no leavened bread be eaten  
4this day ye go forth in the month 
abib  5and it shall be when the lord 
shall bring thee into the land of the 
canaanite  and the hittite  and the 
amorite  and the hivite  and the 
jebusite  which he swore unto thy 13 exodus

 fathers to give thee  a land flowing 
with milk and honey  that thou shalt 
keep this service in this month  6seven 
days thou shalt eat unleavened bread  
and in the seventh day shall be a feast 
to the lord 7unleavened bread shall 
be eaten throughout the seven days  
and there shall no leavened bread be 
seen with thee  neither shall there be 
leaven seen with thee  in all thy 
borders  8and thou shalt tell thy son in 
that day  saying  it is because of that 
which the lord did for me when i 
came forth out of egypt  9and it shall 
be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand  
and for a memorial between thine 
eyes that the law of the lord may be 
in thy mouth  for with a strong hand 
hath the lord brought  thee out of 
egypt  10thou shalt therefore keep this 
ordinance in its season from year to 
year  
11and it shall be when the lord 
shall bring thee into the land of the 
canaanite  as he swore unto thee and 
to thy fathers  and shall give it thee  
12that thou shalt set apart unto the lord 
all that openeth the womb  every 
firstling that is a male  which thou hast 
coming of a beast  shall be the l ords 
13and every firstling of an ass thou 
shalt redeem with a lamb  and if thou 
wilt not redeem it  then thou shalt 
break its neck  and all the first born of 
man among thy sons shalt thou 
redeem  14and it shall be when thy son 
asketh thee in time to come  saying  
what is this  that thou shalt say unto 
him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt  from the  
house of bondage  15and it came to 
pass when pharaoh would hardly let 
us go that the lord slew all the 
firstborn in the land of egypt  both the 
firstborn of man  and the first born of 
beast  therefore i sacrifice to the lord 
all that openeth the womb  being 
males  but all the first born of my sons 
i redeem  16and it shall be for a sign 
upon thy hand  and for frontlets 
between thine eyes  for by strength of 
hand the lord brought us forth out of 
egypt   
  
17and it came to pass  when pharaoh 
had let the people go  that god led 
them not by the way of the land of the 
philistines  although that was near  for 
god said  lest peradventure the 
people repent when they see war  and 
they return to egypt  18but god led 
the people about  by the way of the 
wilderness by the red sea  and the 
children of israel went up armed out of 
the land of egypt  19and moses took 
the bones of joseph with him  for he 
had straitly sworn the children of 
israel  saying  god will sur ely 
remember you  and ye shall carry up 
my bones away hence with you  
20and they took their journey from 
succoth  and encamped in etham  in 
the edge of the wilderness  21and the 
lord went before them by day in a 
pillar of cloud  to lead them the way  
and by night in a pillar of fire  to give 
them light  that they might go by day 
and by night  22the pillar of cloud by exodus 
95 
 day and the pillar of fire by night  
departed not from before the people   
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2speak unto 
the childr en of israel  that they turn 
back and encamp before pi hahiroth  
between migdol and the sea  before 
baalzephon  over against it shall ye 
encamp by the sea  3and pharaoh will 
say of the children of israel  they are 
entangled in the land  the wilderness 
hath shut them in  4and i will harden 
pharaoh s heart  and he shall follow 
after them  and i will get me honour 
upon pharaoh  and upon all his host  
and the egyptians shall know that i am 
the lord and they did so  5and it 
was told the king of egypt that the  
people were fled  and the heart of 
pharaoh and of his servants was turned 
towards the people  and they said  
what is this we have done  that we 
have let israel go from serving us  
6and he made ready his chariots  and 
took his people with him  7and he too k 
six hundred chosen chariots  and all 
the chariots of egypt  and captains 
over all of them  8and the lord 
hardened the heart of pharaoh king of 
egypt  and he pursued after the 
children of israel  for the children of 
israel went out with a high hand  9and 
the egyptians pursued after them  all 
the horses and chariots of pharaoh  and 
his horsemen  and his army  and 
overtook them encamping by the sea  
beside pi hahiroth  in front of baal 
zephon  10and when pharaoh drew 
nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes  and behold  the egyptians 
were marching after them  and they 
were sore afraid  and the children of 
israel cried out unto the lord 11and 
they said unto moses  because there 
were no graves in egypt  hast thou 
taken us away to die in the wilderne ss 
wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us  
to bring us forth out of egypt  12is not 
this the word that we spoke unto thee 
in egypt  saying  let us alone  that we 
may serve the egyptians  for it were 
better for us to serve the egyptians  
than that we shoul d die in the 
wilderness  13and moses said unto the 
people  fear ye not  stand still  and 
see the salvation of the lord which 
he will work for you to day for 
whereas ye have seen the egyptians 
today ye shall see them again no 
more for ever  14the lord will fight 
for you  and ye shall hold your peace   
15and the lord said unto moses  
wherefore criest thou unto me  speak 
unto the children of israel  that they go 
forward  16and lift thou up thy rod  
and stretch out thy hand over the sea  
and divide it  and the children of israel 
shall go into the midst of the sea on 
dry ground  17and i  behold  i will 
harden the hearts of the egyptians  and 
they shall go in after them  and i will 
get me honour upon pharaoh  and 
upon all his host  upon his chariots  
and u pon his horsemen  18and the 
egyptians shall know that i am the 
lord when i have gotten me honour 
upon pharaoh  upon his chariots  and 
upon his horsemen  19and the angel 14 exodus 
96 
 of god  who went before the camp of 
israel  removed and went behind them  
and the pil lar of cloud removed from 
before them  and stood behind them  
20and it came between the camp of 
egypt and the camp of israel  and 
there was the cloud and the darkness 
here yet gave it light by night there  
and the one came not near the other all 
the night  21and moses stretched out 
his hand over the sea  and the lord 
caused the sea to go back by a strong 
east wind all the night  and made the 
sea dry land  and the waters were 
divided  22and the children of israel 
went into the midst of the sea upon the 
dry ground  and the waters were a wall 
unto them on their right hand  and on 
their left  23and the egyptians pursued  
and went in after them into the midst 
of the sea  all pharaoh s horses  his 
chariots  and his horsemen  24and it 
came to pass in the morning w atch 
that the lord looked forth upon the 
host of the egyptians through the pillar 
of fire and of cloud  and discomfited 
the host of the egyptians  25and he 
took off their chariot wheels  and made 
them to drive heavily  so that the 
egyptians said  let us flee from the 
face of israel  for the lord fighteth for 
them against the egyptians   
26and the lord said unto moses  
stretch out thy hand over the sea  that 
the waters may come back upon the 
egyptians  upon their chariots  and 
upon their horsemen  27and moses 
stretched forth his hand over the sea  
and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared  and the 
egyptians fled against it  and the lord 
overthrew the egyptians in the midst 
of the sea  28and the waters returned  
and covered the chario ts and the 
horsemen  even all the host of pharaoh 
that went in after them into the sea  
there remained not so much as one of 
them  29but the children of israel 
walked upon dry land in the midst of 
the sea  and the waters were a wall 
unto them on their rig ht hand  and on 
their left  30thus the lord saved israel 
that day out of the hand of the 
egyptians  and israel saw the 
egyptians dead upon the sea shore  
31and israel saw the great work which 
the lord did upon the egyptians  and 
the people feared the lord and they 
believed in the lord and in his 
servant moses   
 
then sang moses and the 
children of israel this song 
unto the lord and spoke  saying   
i will sing unto the lord for he is 
highly exalted   
the horse and his rider hath he 
thrown into the sea   
2the lord is my strength and song   
and he is become my salvation   
this is my god  and i will glorify 
him  
my father s god  and i will exalt 
him  
3the lord is a man of war   
the lord is his name   
4pharaoh s chariots and his host 
hath he cast into th e sea   15 exodus 
97 
 and his chosen captains are sunk in 
the red sea   
5the deeps cover them  
they went down into the depths like 
a stone   
6thy right hand  o lord glorious in 
power   
thy right hand  o lord dasheth in 
pieces the enemy   
7and in the greatness of thine  
excellency thou overthrowest 
them that rise up against thee   
thou sendest forth thy wrath  it 
consumeth them as stubble   
8and with the blast of thy nostrils 
the waters were piled up  
the floods stood upright as a heap   
the deeps were congealed in the 
heart of the sea   
9the enemy said   
i will pursue  i will overtake  i will 
divide the spoil   
my lust shall be satisfied upon 
them   
i will draw my sword  my hand shall 
destroy them   
10thou didst blow with thy wind  
the sea covered them   
they sank as l ead in the mighty 
waters   
11who is like unto thee  o lord 
among the mighty   
who is like unto thee  glorious in 
holiness   
fearful in praises  doing wonders   
12thou stretchedst out thy right 
hand  
the earth swallowed them   13thou in thy love hast led t he 
people that thou hast redeemed   
thou hast guided them in thy 
strength to thy holy habitation   
14the peoples have heard  they 
tremble   
pangs have taken hold on the 
inhabitants of philistia   
15then were the chiefs of edom 
affrighted   
the mighty men o f moab  trembling 
taketh hold upon them   
all the inhabitants of canaan are 
melted away   
16terror and dread falleth upon 
them   
by the greatness of thine arm they 
are as still as a stone   
till thy people pass over  o lord  
till the people pass over that  thou 
hast gotten   
17thou bringest them in  and 
plantest them in the mountain of 
thine inheritance   
the place  o lord which thou hast 
made for thee to dwell in   
the sanctuary  o lord  which thy 
hands have established   
18the lord shall reign for ever a nd 
ever  
19for the horses of pharaoh went in 
with his chariots and with his 
horsemen into the sea  and the lord 
brought back the waters of the sea 
upon them  but the children of israel 
walked on dry land in the midst of the 
sea  
20and miriam the prophete ss the 
sister of aaron  took a timbrel in her exodus 
98 
 hand  and all the women went out after 
her with timbrels and with dances  
21and miriam sang unto them   
sing ye to the lord for he is highly 
exalted   
the horse and his rider hath he 
thrown into the sea   
 
22and moses led israel onward from 
the red sea  and they went out into the 
wilderness of shur  and they went 
three days in the wilderness  and found 
no water  23and when they came to 
marah  they could not drink of the 
waters of marah  for they were bitter  
therefore the name of it was called 
amarah  24and the people murmured 
against moses  saying  what shall we 
drink  25and he cried unto the lord 
and the lord showed him a tree  and 
he cast it into the waters  and the 
waters were made sweet  there he 
made f or them a statute and an 
ordinance  and there he proved them  
26and he said  if thou wilt diligently 
hearken to the voice of the lord thy 
god and wilt do that which is right in 
his eyes  and wilt give ear to his 
commandments  and keep all his 
statutes  i will put none of the diseases 
upon thee  which i have put upon the 
egyptians  for i am the lord that 
healeth thee   
27and they came to elim  where 
were twelve springs of water  and 
three score and ten palm trees  and 
they encamped there by the waters   
                                                      
a that is bitter ness and they took their journey 
from elim  and all the 
congregation of the children of israel 
came unto the wilderness of sin  
which is between elim and sinai  on 
the fifteenth day of the second month 
after their departing out of the land of 
egypt  2and the whole congregation of 
the children of israel murmured 
against moses and against aaron in 
the wilderness  3and the children of 
israel said unto them  would that we 
had died by the hand of the lord in the 
land of egypt  when we sat by the 
flesh pots when w e did eat bread to 
the full  for ye have brought us forth 
into this wilderness  to kill this whole 
assembly with hunger   
4then said the lord unto moses  
behold  i will cause to rain bread 
from heaven for you  and the people 
shall go out and gather a day s portion 
every day  that i may prove them  
whether they will walk in my law  or 
not 5and it shall come to pass on the 
sixth day that they shall prepare that 
which they bring in  and it shall be 
twice as much as they gather daily  
6and moses and aaron s aid unto all 
the children of israel  at even  then 
ye shall know that the lord hath 
brought you out from the land of 
egypt  7and in the morning  then ye 
shall see the glory of the lord for that 
he hath heard your murmurings 
against the lord and what are  we that 
ye murmur against us  8and moses 
said this shall be  when the lord 
shall give you in the evening flesh to 16 exodus 
99 
 eat and in the morning bread to the 
full for that the lord heareth your 
murmurings which ye murmur against 
him and what are we  your 
murmurings are not against us  but 
against the lord 9and moses said 
unto aaron  say unto all the 
congregation of the children of israel  
come near before the lord for he 
hath heard your murmurings  10and it 
came to pass  as aaron spoke unto the 
whole c ongregation of the children of 
israel  that they looked toward the 
wilderness  and behold  the glory of 
the lord appeared in the cloud  11and 
the lord spoke unto moses  saying  
12i have heard the murmurings of the 
children of israel  speak unto them  
saying at dusk ye shall eat flesh  and 
in the morning ye shall be filled with 
bread  and ye shall know that i am the 
lord your god  13and it came to pass 
at even  that the quails came up  and 
covered the camp  and in the morning 
there was a layer of dew rou nd about 
the camp  14and when the layer of dew 
was gone up  behold upon the face of 
the wilderness a fine  scale like thing  
fine as the hoar frost on the ground  
15and when the children of israel saw 
it they said one to another  awhat is 
itfor they k new not what it was  
and moses said unto them  it is the 
bread which the lord hath given you 
to eat  16this is the thing which the 
lord hath commanded  gather ye of it 
every man according to his eating  an 
                                                      
a heb man hu  omer a head  according to the number 
of your pers ons shall ye take it  every 
man for them that are in his tent  
17and the children of israel did so  and 
gathered some more  some less  18and 
when they did mete it with an omer  he 
that gathered much had nothing over  
and he that gathered little had no la ck 
they gathered every man according to 
his eating  19and moses said unto 
them  let no man leave of it till the 
morning  20notwithstanding they 
hearkened not unto moses  but some 
of them left of it until the morning  and 
it bred worms  and rotted  and m oses 
was wroth with them  21and they 
gathered it morning by morning  every 
man according to his eating  and as the 
sun waxed hot  it melted  22and it 
came to pass that on the sixth day they 
gathered twice as much bread  two 
omers for each one  and all the rulers 
of the congregation came and told 
moses  23and he said unto them  this 
is that which the lord hath spoken  
tomorrow is a solemn rest  a holy 
sabbath unto the lord bake that 
which ye will bake  and seethe that 
which ye will seethe  and all that 
remaineth over lay up for you to be 
kept until the morning  24and they 
laid it up till the morning  as moses 
bade  and it did not rot  neither was 
there any worm therein  25and moses 
said eat that to day for to day is a 
sabbath unto the lord today ye s hall 
not find it in the field  26six days ye 
shall gather it  but on the seventh day 
is the sabbath  in it there shall be exodus 
100 
 none  27and it came to pass on the 
seventh day  that there went out some 
of the people to gather  and they found 
none  28and the lord said unto moses  
how long refuse ye to keep my 
commandments and my laws  29see 
that the lord hath given you the 
sabbath  therefore he giveth you on 
the sixth day the bread of two days  
abide ye every man in his place  let no 
man go out of his place on th e seventh 
clay 30so the people rested on the 
seventh day  31and the house of israel 
called the name thereof amanna  and it 
was like coriander seed  white  and the 
taste of it was like wafers made with 
honey  32and moses said  this is the 
thing which the  lord hath 
commanded  let an omerful of it be 
kept throughout your generations  that 
they may see the bread wherewith i 
fed you in the wilderness  when i 
brought you forth from the land of 
egypt  33and moses said unto aaron  
take a jar  and put an omerfu l of 
manna therein  and lay it up before the 
lord to be kept throughout your 
generations  34as the lord 
commanded moses  so aaron laid it up 
before the testimony  to be kept  
35and the children of israel did eat the 
manna forty years  until they came to a 
land inhabited  they did eat the manna  
until they came unto the borders of the 
land of canaan  36now an omer is the 
tenth part of an ephah   
                                                      
a heb man and all the congregation of 
the children of israel 
journeyed from the wilderness of sin  
by their stages  according to the 
commandment of the lord and 
encamped in rephidim  and there was 
no water for the people to drink  
2wherefore the people strove with 
moses  and said  give us water that 
we may drink  and moses said unto 
them  why strive ye with me  
wherefo re do ye try the lord 3and 
the people thirsted there for water  and 
the people murmured against moses  
and said  wherefore hast thou brought 
us up out of egypt  to kill us and our 
children and our cattle with thirst  
4and moses cried unto the lord 
saying what shall i do unto this 
people  they are almost ready to stone 
me 5and the lord said unto moses  
pass on before the people  and take 
with thee of the elders of israel  and 
thy rod  wherewith thou smotest the 
river  take in thy hand  and go  
6behold i will stand before thee there 
upon the rock in horeb  and thou shalt 
smite the rock  and there shall come 
water out of it  that the people may 
drink  and moses did so in the sight 
of the elders of israel  7and the name 
of the place was called bmassa h and 
cmeribah  because of the striving of 
the children of israel  and because they 
tried the lord saying  is the lord 
among us  or not   
                                                      
b that is trying  
c that is strife  17 exodus 
101 
 8then came amalek  and fought 
with israel in rephidim  9and moses 
said unto joshua  choose us out men  
and go out  fight with amalek  
tomorrow i will stand on the top of the 
hill with the rod of god in my hand  
10so joshua did as moses had said to 
him and fought with amalek  and 
moses  aaron  and hur went up to the 
top of the hill  11and it came to pass  
when moses  held up his hand  that 
israel prevailed  and when he let down 
his hand  amalek prevailed  12but 
moses hands were heavy  and they 
took a stone  and put it under him  and 
he sat thereon  and aaron and hur 
stayed up his hands  the one on the one 
side and th e other on the other side  
and his hands were steady until the 
going down of the sun  13and joshua 
discomfited amalek and his people 
with the edge of the sword   
14and the lord said unto moses  
write this for a memorial in the book  
and rehearse it in the  ears of joshua  
for i will utterly blot out the 
remembrance of amalek from under 
heaven  15and moses built an altar  
and called the name of it aadonai 
nissi 16and he said  the hand upon 
the throne of the lord the lord will 
have war with amalek from 
generation to generation   
 
 
1now jethro  the priest of 
midian  moses father inlaw 
                                                      
a that is the lord is my banner  heard of all that god had done for 
moses  and for israel his people  how 
that the lord had brought israel out of 
egypt  2and jethro  moses father in
law took zippor ah moses wife after 
he had sent her away  3and her two 
sons of whom the name of the one 
was gershom  for he said  i have been 
a stranger in a strange land  4and the 
name of the other was beliezer  for 
the god of my father was my help  and 
delivered m e from the sword of 
pharaoh  5and jethro  moses father 
inlaw came with his sons and his 
wife unto moses into the wilderness 
where he was encamped  at the mount 
of god  6and he said unto moses  i 
thy father inlaw jethro am coming 
unto thee  and thy wif e and her two 
sons with her  7and moses went out 
to meet his father inlaw and bowed 
down and kissed him  and they asked 
each other of their welfare  and they 
came into the tent  8and moses told 
his father inlaw all that the lord had 
done unto pharaoh and to the 
egyptians for israel s sake  all the 
travail that had come upon them by the 
way and how the lord delivered 
them  9and jethro rejoiced for all the 
goodness which the lord had done to 
israel  in that he had delivered them 
out of the hand of the e gyptians  10and 
jethro said  blessed be the lord who 
hath delivered you out of the hand of 
the egyptians  and out of the hand of 
pharaoh  who hath delivered the 
                                                      
b heb el god and ezer help  18 exodus 
102 
 people from under the hand of the 
egyptians  11now i know that the lord 
is greater than all g ods yea for that 
they dealt proudly against them  
12and jethro  moses father inlaw 
took a burnt offering and sacrifices for 
god and aaron came  and all the 
elders of israel  to eat bread with 
moses father inlaw before god  
13and it came to pass on t he morrow  
that moses sat to judge the people  and 
the people stood about moses from the 
morning unto the evening  14and when 
moses father inlaw saw all that he did 
to the people  he said  what is this 
thing that thou doest to the people  
why sittest tho u thyself alone  and all 
the people stand about thee from 
morning unto even  15and moses said 
unto his father inlaw because the 
people come unto me to inquire of 
god 16when they have a matter  it 
cometh unto me  and i judge between 
a man and his neigh bour and i make 
them know the statutes of god  and 
his laws  17and moses father inlaw 
said unto him  the thing that thou 
doest is not good  18thou wilt surely 
wear away  both thou  and this people 
that is with thee  for the thing is too 
heavy for thee  thou art not able to 
perform it thyself alone  19hearken 
now unto my voice  i will give thee 
counsel  and god be with thee  be thou 
for the people before god  and bring 
thou the causes unto god  20and thou 
shalt teach them the statutes and the 
laws and s halt show them the way 
wherein they must walk  and the work that they must do  21moreover thou 
shalt provide out of all the people able 
men such as fear god  men of truth  
hating unjust gain  and place such over 
them  to be rulers of thousands  rulers 
of hundreds  rulers of fifties  and rulers 
of tens  22and let them judge the 
people at all seasons  and it shall be  
that every great matter they shall bring 
unto thee  but every small matter they 
shall judge themselves  so shall they 
make it easier for thee and bear the 
burden with thee  23if thou shalt do this 
thing  and god command thee so  then 
thou shalt be able to endure  and all 
this people also shall go to their place 
in peace  24so moses hearkened to the 
voice of his father inlaw and did all 
that h e had said  25and moses chose 
able men out of all israel  and made 
them heads over the people  rulers of 
thousands  rulers of hundreds  rulers of 
fifties  and rulers of tens  26and they 
judged the people at all seasons  the 
hard causes they brought unto mo ses 
but every small matter they judged 
themselves  27and moses let his 
father inlaw depart  and he went his 
way into his own land   
in the third month after the 
children of israel were gone 
forth out of the land of egypt  the 
same day came they into t he 
wilderness of sinai  2and when they 
were departed from rephidim  and 
were come to the wilderness of sinai  
they encamped in the wilderness  and 
there israel encamped before the 
mount  3and moses went up unto god  19 exodus 
103 
 and the lord called unto him out of 
the mountain  saying  thus shalt thou 
say to the house of jacob  and tell the 
children of israel  4ye have seen what 
i did unto the egyptians  and how i 
bore you on eagles wings  and brought 
you unto myself  5now therefore  if ye 
will hearken unto my voice in deed  
and keep my covenant  then ye shall 
be mine own treasure from among all 
peoples  for all the earth is mine  6and 
ye shall be unto me a kingdom of 
priests  and a holy nation  these are 
the words which thou shalt speak unto 
the children of israel  7and moses 
came and called for the elders of the 
people  and set before them all these 
words which the lord commanded 
him 8and all the people answered 
together  and said  all that the lord 
hath spoken we will do  and moses 
reported the words of the people unto 
the lord 9and the lord said unto 
moses  lo i come unto thee in a 
thick cloud  that the people may hear 
when i speak with thee  and may also 
believe thee for ever  and moses told 
the words of the people unto the lord 
10and the lord said unto moses  go 
unto the people  and sanctify them to 
day and to morrow  and let them wash 
their garments  11and be ready against 
the third day  for the third day the 
lord will come down in the sight of 
all the people upon mount sinai  12and 
thou shalt set bounds un to the people 
round about  saying  take heed to 
yourselves  that ye go not up into the 
mount  or touch the border of it  whosoever toucheth the mount shall be 
surely put to death  13no hand shall 
touch him  but he shall surely be 
stoned  or shot through  whether it be 
beast or man  it shall not live  when 
the ram s horn soundeth long  they 
shall come up to the mount  14and 
moses went down from the mount 
unto the people  and sanctified the 
people  and they washed their 
garments  15and he said unto the 
peopl e be ready against the third 
day come not near a woman  16and it 
came to pass on the third day  when it 
was morning  that there were thunders 
and lightnings and a thick cloud upon 
the mount  and the voice of a horn 
exceeding loud  and all the people th at 
were in the camp trembled  17and 
moses brought forth the people out of 
the camp to meet god  and they stood 
at the nether part of the mount  18now 
mount sinai was altogether on smoke  
because the lord descended upon it in 
fire and the smoke thereof asc ended 
as the smoke of a furnace  and the 
whole mount quaked greatly  19and 
when the voice of the horn waxed 
louder and louder  moses spoke  and 
god answered him by a voice  20and 
the lord came down upon mount 
sinai  to the top of the mount  and the 
lord called moses to the top of the 
mount  and moses went up  21and the 
lord said unto moses  go down  
charge the people  lest they break 
through unto the lord to gaze  and 
many of them perish  22and let the 
priests also  that come near to the exodus 
104 
 lord sanctify the mselves  lest the 
lord break forth upon them  23and 
moses said unto the lord the people 
cannot come up to mount sinai  for 
thou didst charge us  saying  set 
bounds about the mount  and sanctify 
it 24and the lord said unto him  go 
get thee down  and thou shalt come up  
thou and aaron with thee  but let not 
the priests and the people break 
through to come up unto the lord lest 
he break forth upon them  25so 
moses went down unto the people  and 
told them   
and god spoke all these 
words  saying   
2i am the lord thy god  who 
brought thee out of the land of egypt  
out of the house of bondage   
3thou shalt have no other gods 
before me  4thou shalt not make unto 
thee a graven image  nor any manner 
of likeness  of any thing that is in 
heaven above  or th at is in the earth 
beneath  or that is in the water under 
the earth  5thou shalt not bow down 
unto them  nor serve them  for i the 
lord thy god am a jealous god  
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon 
the children unto the third and fourth 
generation of  them that hate me  6and 
showing mercy unto the thousandth 
generation of them that love me and 
keep my commandments   
7thou shalt not take the name of the 
lord thy god in vain  for the lord 
will not hold him guiltless that taketh 
his name in vain   8rememb er the sabbath day  to keep 
it holy  9six days shalt thou labour  
and do all thy work  10but the seventh 
day is a sabbath unto the lord thy 
god in it thou shalt not do any manner 
of work  thou nor thy son  nor thy 
daughter  nor thy man servant  nor thy 
maidservant  nor thy cattle  nor thy 
stranger that is within thy gates  11for 
in six days the lord made heaven and 
earth  the sea  and all that in them is  
and rested on the seventh day  
wherefore the lord blessed the 
sabbath day  and hallowed it   
12honou r thy father and thy mother  
that thy days may be long upon the 
land which the lord thy god giveth 
thee  
13thou shalt not murder   
thou shalt not commit adultery   
thou shalt not steal   
thou shalt not bear false witness 
against thy neighbour   
14thou sha lt not covet thy 
neighbour s house  thou shalt not 
covet thy neighbour s wife  nor his 
manservant  nor his maid servant  nor 
his ox  nor his ass  nor any thing that is 
thy neighbour s  
 
15and all the people perceived the 
thunderings  and the lightnings  and 
the voice of the horn  and the 
mountain smoking  and when the 
people saw it  they trembled  and stood 
afar off  16and they said unto moses  
speak thou with us  and we will hear  
but let not god speak with us  lest we 
die 17and moses said unto the 20 exodus 
105 
 people fear not  for god is come to 
prove you  and that his fear may be 
before you  that ye sin not  18and the 
people stood afar off  but moses drew 
near unto the thick darkness where 
god was   
19and the lord said unto moses  
thus thou shalt say unto the children 
of israel  ye yourselves have seen that 
i have talked with you from heaven  
20ye shall not make with me gods of 
silver  or gods of gold  ye shall not 
make unto you  21an altar of earth thou 
shalt make unto me  and shalt sacrifice 
thereon thy burnt offerings  and thy 
peace offerings  thy sheep  and thine 
oxen  in every place where i cause my 
name to be mentioned i will come unto 
thee and bless thee  22and if thou make 
me an altar of stone  thou shalt not 
build it of hewn stones  for if thou lift 
up thy tool upon it  thou hast profaned 
it 23neither shalt thou go up by steps 
unto mine altar  that thy nakedness be 
not uncovered thereon

plainly say  i love my master  my wife  
and my children  i will not go out free

seventy of the elders of israel  and 
worship ye afar off  2and moses alone 
shall come near unto the lord but 
they shall not come near  neither shall 
the people go up with him  3and 
moses came and told the people all the 
words of the lord and all the 
ordinances  and all the people 
answered with one voice  and said 
all the words which the lord hath 
spoken will we do  4and moses wrote 
all the words of the lord and rose up 
early in the morning  and builded an 
altar under the mount  and twelve 
pillars  according to the twelve tribes 
of israel  5and he sent the young men 
of the children of israel  who offered 
burnt offerings  and sacrificed peace 
offerings of oxen unto the lord 6and 
moses took half of the blood  and put 
it in basins  and half of the blood he 
dashed against the altar  7and he took 
the book of the  covenant  and read in 
the hearing of the people  and they 
said all that the lord hath spoken 
will we do  and obey  8and moses 
took the blood  and sprinkled it on the 
people  and said  behold the blood of 
the covenant  which the lord hath 
made with you  in agreement with all 
these words  9then went up moses  
and aaron  nadab  and abihu  and 
seventy of the elders of israel  10and they saw the god of israel  and there 
was under his feet the like of a paved 
work of sapphire stone  and the like of 
the very heaven for clearness  11and 
upon the nobles of the children of 
israel he laid not his hand  and they 
beheld god  and did eat and drink   
12and the lord said unto moses  
come up to me into the mount and be 
there  and i will give thee the tables of 
stone  and the law and the 
commandment  which i have written  
that thou mayest teach them  13and 
moses rose up  and joshua his 
minister  and moses went up into the 
mount of god  14and unto the elders 
he said  tarry ye here for us  until we 
come back unto you  and behold  
aaron and hur are with you  
whosoever hath a cause  let him come 
near unto them  15and moses went up 
into the mount  and the cloud covered 
the mount  16and the glory of the lord 
abode upon mount sinai  and the cloud 
covered it six days  and the  seventh 
day he called unto moses out of the 
midst of the cloud  17and the 
appearance of the glory of the lord 
was like devouring fire on the top of 
the mount in the eyes of the children 
of israel  18and moses entered into the 
midst of the cloud  and went up into 
the mount  and moses was in the 
mount forty days and forty nights   
 
  
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2speak unto 
the children of israel  that they take for 24

and in knowledge  and in all manner of 
workmanship  4to devise skilful works  
to work in gold  and in silver  and in 
brass  5and in cutting of stones for 
setting  and in carving of wood  to 
work in all manner of workmanship  
6and i  behold  i have appointed with 
him oholiab  the son of ahisamach  of 
the tribe of  dan and in the hearts of 
all that are wise hearted i have put 
wisdom  that they may make all that i 
have commanded thee  7the tent of 
meeting  and the ark of the testimony  
and the ark cover that is thereupon  
and all the furniture of the tent  8and

his sons  to minister in the priest s 
office  11and the anointing oil  and the 
incense of sweet spices for the holy place  according to all that i have 
commanded thee shall they do   
12and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  13speak thou al so unto the 
children of israel  saying  verily ye 
shall keep my sabbaths  for it is a sign 
between me and you throughout your 
generations  that ye may know that i 
am the lord who sanctify you  14ye 
shall keep the sabbath therefore  for it 
is holy unto you  every one that 
profaneth it shall surely be put to 
death  for whosoever doeth any work 
therein  that soul shall be cut off from 
among his people  15six days shall 
work be done  but on the seventh day 
is a sabbath of solemn rest  holy to the 
lord whosoeve r doeth any work in 
the sabbath day  he shall surely be put 
to death  16wherefore the children of 
israel shall keep the sabbath  to 
observe the sabbath throughout their 
generations  for a perpetual covenant  
17it is a sign between me and the 
children of is rael for ever  for in six 
days the lord made heaven and earth  
and on the seventh day he ceased from 
work and rested   
18and he gave unto moses  when 
he had made an end of speaking with 
him upon mount sinai  the two tables 
of the testimony  tables of ston e 
written with the finger of god   
and when the people saw that 
moses delayed to come down 
from the mount  the people gathered 
themselves together unto aaron  and 
said unto him  up make us a god 
who shall go before us  for as for this 31 
32 exodus 
123 
 moses  the man that brought us up out 
of the land of egypt  we know not 
what is become of him  2and aaron 
said unto them  break off the golden 
rings  which are in the ears of your 
wives  of your sons  and of your 
daughters  and bring them unto me  
3and all the people broke off the 
golden rings which were in their ears  
and brought them unto aaron  4and he 
received it at their hand  and fashioned 
it with a graving tool  and made it a 
molten calf  and they said  this is thy 
god o israel  which brought thee up 
out of th e land of egypt  5and when 
aaron saw this  he built an altar before 
it and aaron made proclamation  and 
said tomorrow shall be a feast to 
the lord 6and they rose up early on 
the morrow  and offered burnt 
offerings  and brought peace offerings  
and t he people sat down to eat and to 
drink  and rose up to make merry   
7and the lord spoke unto moses  
go get thee down  for thy people  
that thou broughtest up out of the land 
of egypt  have dealt corruptly  8they 
have turned aside quickly out of the 
way w hich i commanded them  they 
have made them a molten calf  and 
have worshipped it  and have 
sacrificed unto it  and said  this is thy 
god o israel  which brought thee up 
out of the land of egypt  9and the 
lord said unto moses  i have seen 
this people  and behold  it is a 
stiffnecked people  10now therefore let 
me alone  that my wrath may wax hot 
against them  and that i may consume them  and i will make of thee a great 
nation  11and moses besought the 
lord his god  and said  lord why 
doth thy wrath wa x hot against thy 
people  that thou hast brought forth 
out of the land of egypt with great 
power and with a mighty hand  
12wherefore should the egyptians 
speak  saying  for evil did he bring 
them forth  to slay them in the 
mountains  and to consume them fr om 
the face of the earth  turn from thy 
fierce wrath  and repent of this evil 
against thy people  13remember 
abraham  isaac  and israel  thy 
servants  to whom thou didst swear by 
thine own self  and saidst unto them  i 
will multiply your seed as the stars of 
heaven  and all this land that i have 
spoken of will i give unto your seed  
and they shall inherit it for ever  
14and the lord repented of the evil 
which he said he would do unto his 
people   
15and moses turned  and went down 
from the mount  with the t wo tables of 
the testimony in his hand  tables that 
were written on both their sides  on the 
one side and on the other were they 
written  16and the tables were the 
work of god  and the writing was the 
writing of god  graven upon the 
tables  17and when josh ua heard the 
noise of the people as they shouted  he 
said unto moses  there is a noise of 
war in the camp  18and he said  it is 
not the voice of them that shout for 
mastery  neither is it the voice of them 
that cry for being overcome  but the exodus 
124 
 noise of t hem that sing do i hear  
19and it came to pass  as soon as he 
came nigh unto the camp  that he saw 
the calf and the dancing  and 
moses anger waxed hot  and he cast 
the tables out of his hands  and broke 
them beneath the mount  20and he 
took the calf which  they had made  
and burnt it with fire  and ground it to 
powder  and strewed it upon the water  
and made the children of israel drink 
of it  21and moses said unto aaron  
what did this people unto thee  that 
thou hast brought a great sin upon 
them  22and aaron said  let not the 
anger of my lord wax hot  thou 
knowest the people  that they are set 
on evil  23so they said unto me  make 
us a god  which shall go before us  for 
as for this moses  the man that brought 
us up out of the land of egypt  we 
know not what is become of him  
24and i said unto them  whosoever 
hath any gold  let them break it off  so 
they gave it me  and i cast it into the 
fire and there came out this calf  
25and when moses saw that the people 
were broken loose for aaron had let 
them loo se for a derision among their 
enemies  26then moses stood in the 
gate of the camp  and said  whoso is 
on the l ords side let him come unto 
me and all the sons of levi gathered 
themselves together unto him  27and 
he said unto them  thus saith the 
lord the god of israel  put ye every 
man his sword upon his thigh  and go 
to and fro from gate to gate throughout 
the camp  and slay every man his brother  and every man his companion  
and every man his neighbour  28and 
the sons of levi did according to the 
word of moses  and there fell of the 
people that day about three thousand 
men 29and moses said  consecrate 
yourselves to day to the lord for 
every man hath been against his son 
and against his brother  that he may 
also bestow upon you a blessing this 
day 30and it came to pass on the 
morrow  that moses said unto the 
people  ye have sinned a great sin  
and now i will go up unto the lord 
peradventure i shall make atonement 
for your sin  31and moses returned 
unto the lord and said  oh this 
people have  sinned a great sin  and 
have made them a god of gold  32yet 
now if thou wilt forgive their sin  
and if not  blot me  i pray thee  out of 
thy book which thou hast written  
33and the lord said unto moses  
whosoever hath sinned against me  
him will i blo t out of my book  34and 
now go  lead the people unto the place 
of which i have spoken unto thee  
behold  mine angel shall go before 
thee nevertheless in the day when i 
visit i will visit their sin upon them  
35and the lord smote the people  
because they  made the calf  which 
aaron made   
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  depart  go up hence  
thou and the people that thou hast 
brought up out of the land of egypt  
unto the land of which i swore unto 
abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  33 exodus 
125 
 saying  unto thy seed wi ll i give it  
2and i will send an angel before thee  
and i will drive out the canaanite  the 
amorite  and the hittite  and the 
perizzite  the hivite  and the 
jebusite  3unto a land flowing with 
milk and honey  for i will not go up in 
the midst of thee  for thou art a 
stiffnecked people  lest i consume thee 
in the way  4and when the people 
heard these evil tidings  they mourned  
and no man did put on him his 
ornaments  5and the lord said unto 
moses  say unto the children of 
israel  ye are a stiffnecked peo ple if i 
go up into the midst of thee for one 
moment  i shall consume thee  
therefore now put off thy ornaments 
from thee  that i may know what to do 
unto thee  6and the children of israel 
stripped themselves of their ornaments 
from mount horeb onward   
7now moses used to take the tent 
and to pitch it without the camp  afar 
off from the camp  and he called it the 
tent of meeting  and it came to pass  
that every one that sought the lord 
went out unto the tent of meeting  
which was without the camp  8and it  
came to pass  when moses went out 
unto the tent  that all the people rose 
up and stood  every man at his tent 
door and looked after moses  until he 
was gone into the tent  9and it came 
to pass  when moses entered into the 
tent the pillar of cloud desce nded  
and stood at the door of the tent  and 
the lord spoke with moses  10and 
when all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent  all 
the people rose up and worshipped  
every man at his tent door  11and the 
lord spoke unto moses fa ce to face  as 
a man speaketh unto his friend  and he 
would return into the camp  but his 
minister joshua  the son of nun  a 
young man  departed not out of the 
tent  
12and moses said unto the lord 
see thou sayest unto me  bring up 
this people  and thou  hast not let me 
know whom thou wilt send with me  
yet thou hast said  i know thee by 
name  and thou hast also found grace 
in my sight  13now therefore  i pray 
thee  if i have found grace in thy 
sight  show me now thy ways  that i 
may know thee  to the end  that i may 
find grace in thy sight  and consider 
that this nation is thy people  14and 
he said  my presence shall go with 
thee and i will give thee rest  15and 
he said unto him  if thy presence go 
not with me  carry us not up hence  
16for wherein now  shall it be known 
that i have found grace in thy sight  i 
and thy people  is it not in that thou 
goest with us  so that we are 
distinguished  i and thy people  from 
all the people that are upon the face of 
the earth   
17and the lord said unto moses  i 
will do this thing also that thou hast 
spoken  for thou hast found grace in 
my sight  and i know thee by name  
18and he said  show me  i pray thee  
thy glory  19and he said  i will 
make all my goodness pass before exodus 
126 
 thee and will proclaim the name of the  
lord before thee  and i will be 
gracious to whom i will be gracious  
and will show mercy on whom i will 
show mercy  20and he said  thou 
canst not see my face  for man shall 
not see me and live  21and the lord 
said behold  there is a place by me  
and thou shalt stand upon the rock  
22and it shall come to pass  while my 
glory passeth by  that i will put thee in 
a cleft of the rock  and will cover thee 
with my hand until i have passed by  
23and i will take away my hand  and 
thou shalt see my back  but my  face 
shall not be seen   
and the lord said unto 
moses  hew thee two tables 
of stone like unto the first  and i will 
write upon the tables the words that 
were on the first tables  which thou 
didst break  2and be ready by the 
morning  and come up in th e morning 
unto mount sinai  and present thyself 
there to me on the top of the mount  
3and no man shall come up with thee  
neither let any man be seen throughout 
all the mount  neither let the flocks nor 
herds feed before that mount  4and he 
hewed two tabl es of stone like unto the 
first and moses rose up early in the 
morning  and went up unto mount 
sinai  as the lord had commanded 
him and took in his hand two tables of 
stone  5and the lord descended in the 
cloud  and stood with him there  and 
proclaimed t he name of the lord 
6and the lord passed by before him  
and proclaimed  the lord the lord god merciful and gracious  long
suffering  and abundant in goodness 
and truth  7keeping mercy unto the 
thousandth generation  forgiving 
iniquity and transgressio n and sin  and 
that will by no means clear the guilty  
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon 
the children  and upon the children s 
children  unto the third and unto the 
fourth generation  8and moses made 
haste  and bowed his head toward the 
earth  and worshipped  9and he said  
if now i have found grace in thy 
sight  o lord  let the lord  i pray 
thee  go in the midst of us  for it is a 
stiffnecked people  and pardon our 
iniquity and our sin  and take us for 
thine inheritance  10and he said  
behold  i make a covenant  before all 
thy people i will do marvels  such as 
have not been wrought in all the earth  
nor in any nation  and all the people 
among which thou art shall see the 
work of the lord that i am about to do 
with thee  that it is tremendous  
11observe thou that which i am 
commanding thee this day  behold  i 
am driving out before thee the 
amorite  and the canaanite  and the 
hittite  and the perizzite  and the 
hivite  and the jebusite  12take heed to 
thyself  lest thou make a covenant with 
the inha bitants of the land whither 
thou goest  lest they be for a snare in 
the midst of thee  13but ye shall break 
down their altars  and dash in pieces 
their pillars  and ye shall cut down 
their asherim  14for thou shalt bow 
down to no other god  for the lord 34 exodus 
127 
 whose name is jealous  is a jealous 
god 15lest thou make a covenant with 
the inhabitants of the land  and they go 
astray after their gods  and do sacrifice 
unto their gods  and they call thee  and 
thou eat of their sacrifice  16and thou 
take of their daugh ters unto thy sons  
and their daughters go astray after 
their gods  and make thy sons go 
astray after their gods  17thou shalt 
make thee no molten gods  18the feast 
of unleavened bread shalt thou keep  
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened 
bread  as i comma nded thee  at the 
time appointed in the month abib  for 
in the month abib thou camest out 
from egypt  19all that openeth the 
womb is mine  and of all thy cattle 
thou shalt sanctify the males  the 
firstlings of ox and sheep  20and the 
firstling of an ass th ou shalt redeem 
with a lamb  and if thou wilt not 
redeem it  then thou shalt break its 
neck  all the first born of thy sons 
thou shalt redeem  and none shall 
appear before me empty  21six days 
thou shalt work  but on the seventh 
day thou shalt rest  in plo wing time 
and in harvest thou shalt rest  22and 
thou shalt observe the feast of weeks  
even of the first fruits of wheat 
harvest  and the feast of ingathering at 
the turn of the year  23three times in 
the year shall all thy males appear 
before the lord g od the god of israel  
24for i will cast out nations before 
thee and enlarge thy borders  neither 
shall any man covet thy land  when 
thou goest up to appear before the lord thy god three times in the year  
25thou shalt not offer the blood of my 
sacrifice wi th leavened bread  neither 
shall the sacrifice of the feast of the 
passover be left unto the morning  
26the choicest first fruits of thy land 
thou shalt bring unto the house of the 
lord thy god  thou shalt not seethe a 
kid in its mother s milk   
27and the  lord said unto moses  
write thou these words  for after the 
tenor of these words i have made a 
covenant with thee and with israel  
28and he was there with the lord forty 
days and forty nights  he did neither 
eat bread  nor drink water  and he 
wrote upon  the tables the words of the 
covenant  the ten words  29and it came 
to pass  when moses came down from 
mount sinai with the two tables of the 
testimony in moses hand  when he 
came down from the mount  that 
moses knew not that the skin of his 
face sent fort h abeams while he talked 
with him  30and when aaron and all 
the children of israel saw moses  
behold  the skin of his face sent forth 
beams  and they were afraid to come 
nigh him  31and moses called unto 
them  and aaron and all the rulers of 
the congregati on returned unto him  
and moses spoke to them  32and 
afterward all the children of israel 
came nigh  and he gave them in 
commandment all that the lord had 
spoken with him in mount sinai  33and 
when moses had done speaking with 
                                                      
a heb horns  exodus 
128 
 them  he put a veil on his fa ce 34but 
when moses went in before the lord 
that he might speak with him  he took 
the veil off  until he came out  and he 
came out  and spoke unto the children 
of israel that which he was 
commanded  35and the children of 
israel saw the face of moses  that the 
skin of moses face sent forth beams  
and moses put the veil back upon his 
face until he went in to speak with 
him  
  
and moses assembled all the 
congregation of the children of 
israel  and said unto them  these are 
the words which the lord hath 
commanded  that ye should do them  
2six days shall work be done  but on 
the seventh day there shall be to you a 
holy day  a sabbath of solemn rest to 
the lord whosoever doeth any work 
therein shall be put to death  3ye shall 
kindle no fire throughout your 
habitations upon the sabbath day   
4and moses spoke unto all the 
congregation of the children of israel  
saying  this is the thing which the 
lord commanded  saying  5take ye 
from among you an offering unto the 
lord whosoever is of a willing heart  
let him bring it  the l ords offering  
gold and silver  and brass  6and blue  
and purple  and scarlet  and fine linen  
and goats hair 7and rams skins dyed 
red and sealskins  and acacia wood  
8and oil for the light  and spices for the 
anointing oil  and for the sweet 
incense  9and onyx stones  and stones to be set  for the ephod  and for the 
breastplate  10and let every wise

and the burnt offering  and the peace 
offerings  23and moses and aaron 
went into the tent of mee ting and 
came out  and blessed the people  and 
the glory of the lord appeared unto all 
the people  24and there came forth fire 
from before the lord and consumed 
upon the altar the burnt offering and 
the fat  and when all the people saw it  
they shouted  and fell on their faces   
and nadab and abihu  the 
sons of aaron  took each of 
them his censer  and put fire therein  
and laid incense thereon  and offered 
strange fire before the lord which he 
had not commanded them  2and there 
came forth fire from be fore the lord 
and devoured them  and they died 
before the lord 3then moses said 
unto aaron  this is it that the lord 
spoke  saying  through them that are 
nigh unto me i will be sanctified  and 
before all the people i will be 
glorified  and aaron held h is peace  
4and moses called mishael and 
elzaphan  the sons of uzziel the uncle 
of aaron  and said unto them  draw 
near carry your brethren from before

they drew near  and carried them in 
their tunics out of the camp  as moses 
had said  6and moses said unto aaron  
and unto eleazar and unto ithamar  his 10 leviticus  
152 
 sons let not the hair of your heads 
go loose  neither tend your clothes  
that ye die not  and that he be not 
wroth with all the congregation  but let 
your brethren  the whole house of 
israel  bewail the burning which the 
lord hath kindled  7and ye shall not 
go out from the door of the tent of 
meeting  lest ye die  for the anointing 
oil of the lord is upon you  and they 
did according to the word of moses   
 
8and the lord spoke unto aaron  
saying  9drink no wine nor strong 
drink  thou nor thy sons with thee  
when ye go into the tent of meeting  
that ye die not  it shall be a statute 
forever throughout your generations  
10and that ye may put difference 
between the holy and  the common  and 
between the unclean and the clean  
11and that ye may teach the children of 
israel all the statutes which the lord 
hath spoken unto them by the hand of 
moses   
12and moses spoke unto aaron  and 
unto eleazar and unto ithamar  his 
sons that were left  take the meal 
offering that remaineth of the offerings 
of the lord made by fire  and eat it 
without leaven beside the altar  for it is 
most holy  13and ye shall eat it in a 
holy place  because it is thy due  and 
thy sons due of the offerings o f the 
lord made by fire  for so i am 
commanded  14and the breast of 
waving and the thigh of heaving shall 
ye eat in a clean place  thou and thy 
sons and thy daughters with thee  for they are given as thy due  and thy 
sonsdue out of the sacrifices of th e 
peace offerings of the children of 
israel  15the thigh of heaving and the 
breast of waving shall they bring with 
the offerings of the fat made by fire  to 
wave it for a wave offering before the 
lord and it shall be thine  and thy 
sonswith thee  as a du e for ever  as 
the lord hath commanded   
16and moses diligently inquired for 
the goat of the sin offering  and 
behold  it was burnt  and he was angry 
with eleazar and with ithamar  the 
sons of aaron that were left  saying  
17wherefore have ye not eaten the sin 
offering in the place of the sanctuary  
seeing it is most holy  and he hath 
given it you to bear the iniquity of the 
congregation  to make atonement for 
them before the lord 18behold  the 
blood of it was not brought into the 
sanctuary within  ye should certainly 
have eaten it in the sanctuary  as i 
commanded  19and aaron spoke unto 
moses  behold  this day have they 
offered their sin offering and their 
burnt offering before the lord and 
there have befallen me such things as 
these  and if i had ea ten the sin 
offering to day would it have been 
wellpleasing in the sight of the lord 
20and when moses heard that  it was 
wellpleasing in his sight

the lord commanded  moses   
 
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2speak unto 
aaron  and unto his sons  and unto all 
the children of israel  and say unto 
them  this is the thing which the lord 
hath commanded  saying   
3what man soever there be of the 
house of israel  that killeth an ox  or 
lamb  or goat  in the camp  or that 
killeth it without the camp  4and hath 
not brought it unto the door of the tent 
of meeting  to present it as an offering 
unto the lord before the tabernacle of 
the lord blood shall be imputed unto 
that man  he hath shed blood  and that 
man shall be cut off from among his

them for sacrifices of peace offerings 
unto the lord 6and the priest shall 
dash the blood against the altar of the

and make the fat smoke for a sweet 
savour unto the lord 7and they shall 
no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto 
the satyrs  after whom they go astray  
this shall be a statute for ever unto 
them throughout their generations   17 leviticus

 8and thou shalt say unto them  
whatsoever man there be of the house 
of israel  or of the strangers that 
sojourn among them  that offereth a 
burnt offering or sacrifice  9and 
bringeth it not unto the door of the tent 
of meeting  to sacrifice it unto the 
lord even that man shall be cut off 
from his people   
10and whatsoever man there be  of 
the house of israel  or of the strangers 
that sojourn among them  that eateth 
any manner of blood  i will set my 
face against that soul that eateth blood  
and will cut him off from among his 
people  11for the life of the flesh is in 
the blood  and i ha ve given it to you 
upon the altar to make atonement for 
your souls  for it is the blood that 
maketh atonement by reason of the 
life 12therefore i said unto the 
children of israel  no soul of you shall 
eat blood  neither shall any stranger 
that sojourneth among you eat blood  
13and whatsoever man there be of the 
children of israel  or of the strangers 
that sojourn among them  that taketh in 
hunting any beast or fowl that may be 
eaten  he shall pour out the blood 
thereof  and cover it with dust  14for as 
to the life of all flesh  the blood thereof 
is all one with the life thereof  
therefore i said unto the children of 
israel  ye shall eat the blood of no 
manner of flesh  for the life of all flesh 
is the blood thereof  whosoever eateth 
it shall be cut off  15and every soul 
that eateth that which dieth of itself  or 
that which is torn of beasts  whether he be home born or a stranger  he shall 
wash his clothes  and bathe himself in 
water  and be unclean until the even  
then shall he be clean  16but if he wash 
them not  nor bathe his flesh  then he 
shall bear his iniquity   
 
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2speak unto 
the children of israel  and say unto 
them

rest and repay her sabbaths  35as long 
as it lieth desolate it shal l have rest  
even the rest which it had not in your 
sabbaths  when ye dwelt upon it  36and 
as for them that are left of you  i will 
send a faintness into their heart in the 
lands of their enemies  and the sound 
of a driven leaf shall chase them  and 
they s hall flee  as one fleeth from the 
sword  and they shall fall when none 
pursueth  37and they shall stumble one 
upon another  as it were before the 
sword  when none pursueth  and ye 
shall have no power to stand before 
your enemies  38and ye shall perish 
amon g the nations  and the land of leviticus  
182 
 your enemies shall eat you up  39and 
they that are left of you shall pine 
away in their iniquity in your 
enemies lands  and also in the 
iniquities of their fathers shall they 
pine away with them  40and they shall 
confess thei r iniquity  and the iniquity 
of their fathers  in their treachery 
which they committed against me  and 
also that they have walked contrary 
unto me  41i also will walk contrary 
unto them  and bring them into the 
land of their enemies  if then 
perchance thei r uncircumcised heart be 
humbled  and they then be paid the 
punishment of their iniquity  42then 
will i remember my covenant with 
jacob  and also my covenant with 
isaac  and also my covenant with 
abraham will i remember  and i will 
remember the land  43for the land shall 
lie forsaken without them  and shall be 
paid her sabbaths  while she lieth 
desolate without them  and they shall 
be paid the punishment of their 
iniquity  because  even because they 
rejected mine ordinances  and their 
soul abhorred my statu tes 44and yet 
for all that  when they are in the land 
of their enemies  i will not reject them  
neither will i abhor them  to destroy 
them utterly  and to break my 
covenant with them  for i am the lord 
their god  45but i will for their sakes 
remember the covenant of their 
ancestors  whom i brought forth out of 
the land of egypt in the sight of the 
nations  that i might be their god  i am

the tent of meeting that he might 
speak with him  then he heard the 
voice speaking un to him from above 
the ark cover that was upon the ark of 
the testimony  from between the two 
cherubim  and he spoke unto him   
 
  
and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  2speak unto aaron  and 
say unto him  when thou lightest the 
lamps  the seven la mps shall give light 
in front of the candlestick  3and 
aaron did so  he lighted the lamps 
thereof so as to give light in front of 
the candlestick  as the lord 
commanded moses  4and this was the 
work of the candlestick  beaten work 
of gold  unto the base t hereof  and 
unto the flowers thereof  it was beaten 
work  according unto the pattern 
which the lord had shown moses  so 
he made the candlestick   
5and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  6take the levites from among 
the children of israel  and cleanse 
them  7and thus shalt thou do unto 
them  to cleanse them  sprinkle the 
water of purification upon them  and 
let them cause a razor to pass over all 
their flesh  and let them wash their 
clothes  and cleanse themselves  8then 
let them take a young bullock  and i ts 
meal offering  fine flour mingled with 
oil and another young bullock shalt 
thou take for a sin offering  9and thou 
shalt present the levites before the 8 numbers  
202 
 tent of meeting  and thou shalt 
assemble the whole congregation of 
the children of israel  10and tho u shalt 
present the levites before the lord 
and the children of israel shall lay their 
hands upon the levites  11and aaron 
shall offer the levites before the lord 
for a wave offering from the children 
of israel  that they may be to do the 
service of the lord 12and the levites 
shall lay their hands upon the heads of 
the bullocks  and offer thou the one for 
a sin offering  and the other for a 
burnt offering  unto the lord to make 
atonement for the levites  13and thou 
shalt set the levites before aaron  and 
before his sons  and offer them for a 
wave offering unto the lord 14thus 
shalt thou separate the levites from 
among the children of israel  and the 
levites shall be mine  15and after that 
shall the levites go in to do the service 
of the tent of meeting  and thou shalt 
cleanse them  and offer them for a 
wave offering  16for they are wholly 
given unto me from among the 
children of israel  instead of all that 
openeth the womb  even the first born 
of all the children of israel  have i 
taken them unto me  17for all the first 
born among the children of israel are 
mine  both man and beast  on the day 
that i smote all the first born in the 
land of egypt i sanctified them for 
myself  18and i have taken the levites 
instead of all the first born among the 
children of  israel  19and i have given 
the levites  they are given to aaron 
and to his sons from among the children of israel  to do the service of 
the children of israel in the tent of 
meeting  and to make atonement for 
the children of israel  that there be no 
plagu e among the children of israel  
through the children of israel coming 
nigh unto the sanctuary  20thus did 
moses  and aaron  and all the 
congregation of the children of israel  
unto the levites  according unto all 
that the lord commanded moses 
touching the  levites  so did the 
children of israel unto them  21and the 
levites purified themselves  and they 
washed their clothes  and aaron 
offered them for a sacred gift before 
the lord and aaron made atonement 
for them to cleanse them  22and after 
that went the levites in to do their 
service in the tent of meeting before 
aaron  and before his sons  as the 
lord had commanded moses 
concerning the levites  so did they 
unto them   
23and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  24this is that which pertaineth 
unto the levi tes from twenty and five 
years old and upward they shall go in 
to perform the service in the work of 
the tent of meeting  25and from the age 
of fifty years they shall return from the 
service of the work  and shall serve no 
more  26but shall minister with their 
brethren in the tent of meeting  to keep 
the charge  but they shall do no 
manner of service  thus shalt thou do 
unto the levites touching their 
charges   numbers  
203 
 and the lord spoke unto moses 
in the wilderness of sinai  in the 
first month of the second ye ar after 
they were come out of the land of 
egypt  saying  2let the children of 
israel keep the passover in its 
appointed season  3in the fourteenth 
day of this month  at dusk  ye shall 
keep it in its appointed season  
according to all the statutes of it  and 
according to all the ordinances thereof  
shall ye keep it  4and moses spoke 
unto the children of israel  that they 
should keep the passover  5and they 
kept the passover in the first month  on 
the fourteenth day of the month  at 
dusk  in the wilderness  of sinai  
according to all that the lord 
commanded moses  so did the children 
of israel  6but there were certain men  
who were unclean by the dead body of 
a man  so that they could not keep the 
passover on that day  and they came 
before moses and before a aron on that 
day 7and those men said unto him  
we are unclean by the dead body of a 
man wherefore are we to be kept 
back  so as not to bring the offering of 
the lord in its appointed season 
among the children of israel  8and 
moses said unto them  stay ye that i 
may hear what the lord will command 
concerning you   
9and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  10speak unto the children of 
israel  saying  if any man of you or of 
your generations shall be unclean by 
reason of a dead body  or be in a 
journey a far off  yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord 11in the 
second month on the fourteenth day at 
dusk they shall keep it  they shall eat it 
with unleavened bread and bitter 
herbs  12they shall leave none of it unto 
the morning  nor break a bone thereo f 
according to all the statute of the 
passover they shall keep it  13but the 
man that is clean  and is not on a 
journey  and forbeareth to keep the 
passover  that soul shall be cut off 
from his people  because he brought 
not the offering of the lord in it s 
appointed season  that man shall bear 
his sin  14and if a stranger shall 
sojourn among you  and will keep the 
passover unto the lord according to 
the statute of the passover  and 
according to the ordinance thereof  so 
shall he do  ye shall have one stat ute 
both for the stranger  and for him that 
is born in the land   
 
15and on the day that the tabernacle 
was reared up the cloud covered the 
tabernacle  even the tent of the 
testimony  and at even there was upon 
the tabernacle as it were the 
appearance of  fire until morning  16so 
it was alway  the cloud covered it  and 
the appearance of fire by night  17and 
whenever the cloud was taken up from 
over the tent  then after that the 
children of israel journeyed  and in the 
place where the cloud abode  there th e 
children of israel encamped  18at the 
commandment of the lord the 
children of israel journeyed  and at the 
commandment of the lord they 9 numbers  
204 
 encamped  as long as the cloud abode 
upon the tabernacle they remained 
encamped  19and when the cloud 
tarried upon the  tabernacle many days  
then the children of israel kept the 
charge of the lord and journeyed not  
20and sometimes the cloud was a few 
days upon the tabernacle  according to 
the commandment of the lord they 
remained encamped  and according to 
the commandme nt of the lord they 
journeyed  21and sometimes the cloud 
was from evening until morning  and 
when the cloud was taken up in the 
morning  they journeyed  or if it 
continued by day and by night  when 
the cloud was taken up  they 
journeyed  22whether it were two days  
or a month  or a year  that the cloud 
tarried upon the tabernacle  abiding 
thereon  the children of israel 
remained encamped  and journeyed 
not but when it was taken up  they 
journeyed  23at the commandment of 
the lord they encamped  and at the 
commandment of the lord they 
journeyed  they kept the charge of the 
lord at the commandment of the 
lord by the hand of moses   
 
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2make thee 
two trumpets of silver  of beaten work 
shalt thou make them  and they sha ll 
be unto thee for the calling of the 
congregation  and for causing the 
camps to set forward  3and when they 
shall blow with them  all the 
congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of 
meeting  4and if they blow but with 
one then the princes  the heads of the 
thousands of israel  shall gather 
themselves unto thee  5and when ye 
blow an alarm  the camps that lie on 
the east side shall take their journey  
6and when ye blow an alarm the 
second time  the camps that lie on the 
south side shall set forward  they shall 
blow an alarm for their journeys  7but 
when the assembly is to be gathered 
together  ye shall blow  but ye shall 
not sound an alarm  8and the sons of 
aaron  the priests  shall blow with the 
trumpets  and they shall be to you for a 
statute for ever throughout your 
generations  9and when ye go to war 
in your land against the adversary that 
oppresseth you  then ye shall sound an 
alarm with the trumpets  and ye shall 
be remembered before the lord your 
god and ye shall be save d from your 
enemies  10also in the day of your 
gladness  and in your appointed 
seasons  and in your new moons  ye 
shall blow with the trumpets over your 
burnt offerings  and over the sacrifices 
of your peace offerings  and they shall 
be to you for a memori al before your 
god i am the lord your god   
 
11and it came to pass in the second 
year in the second month  on the 
twentieth day of the month  that the 
cloud was taken up from over the 
tabernacle of the testimony  12and the 
children of israel set forward  by their 
stages out of the wilderness of sinai  10 numbers  
205 
 and the cloud abode in the wilderness 
of paran 13and they took their first 
journey  according to the 
commandment of the lord by the hand 
of moses  14and in the first place the 
standard of the camp of the ch ildren of 
judah set forward according to their 
hosts  and over his host was nahshon 
the son of amminadab  15and over the 
host of the tribe of the children of 
issachar was nethanel the son of zuar  
16and over the host of the tribe of the 
children of zebulun  was eliab the son 
of helon  17and the tabernacle was 
taken down  and the sons of gershon 
and the sons of merari  who bore the 
tabernacle  set forward  18and the

shedeur  19and over the host of the 
tribe of the children of simeon was

20and over the host of the tribe of the

bearers of the sanctuar y set forward  
that the tabernacle might be set up

standard of the camp of the children of 
ephraim set forward according to their

27and over the host of the tribe of the 
children of naphtali was ahira the son

of the children of israel according to 
their hosts and they set forward   
29and moses said unto hobab  the 
son of reuel the midianite  
moses father inlaw we are 
journeying unto the place of which the 
lord said i will giv e it you  come 
thou with us  and we will do thee 
good  for the lord hath spoken good 
concerning israel  30and he said unto 
him i will not go  but i will depart to 
mine own land  and to my kindred  
31and he said  leave us not  i pray 
thee forasmuch as  thou knowest how 
we are to encamp in the wilderness  
and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes  
32and it shall be  if thou go with us  
yea it shall be  that what good soever 
the lord shall do unto us  the same 
will we do unto thee   
33and they set forward  from the 
mount of the lord three days journey  
and the ark of the covenant of the lord 
went before them three days journey  
to seek out a resting place for them  
34and the cloud of the lord was over 
them by day  when they set forward 
from the camp   
35and it came to pass  when the ark 
set forward  that moses said  rise up  numbers  
206 
 o lord and let thine enemies be 
scattered  and let them that hate thee 
flee before thee  36and when it 
rested  he said  return  o lord unto 
the ten thousands of the families of 
israel  
and the people were as 
murmurers  speaking evil in 
the ears of the lord and when the 
lord heard it  his anger was kindled  
and the fire of the lord burnt among 
them  and devoured in the uttermost 
part of the camp  2and the people cried 
unto moses  and moses prayed unto 
the lord and the fire abated  3and the 
name of that place was called 
ataberah  because the fire of the lord 
burnt among them   
4and the mixed multitude that was 
among them fell a lusting  and the 
children of israel also wept on the ir 
part and said  would that we were 
given flesh to eat  5we remember the 
fish which we were wont to eat in 
egypt for nought  the cucumbers  and 
the melons  and the leeks  and the 
onions  and the garlic  6but now our 
soul is dried away  there is nothing  at 
all we have nought save this manna to 
look to 7now the manna was like 
coriander seed  and the appearance 
thereof as the appearance of bdellium  
8the people went about  and gathered 
it and ground it in mills  or beat it in 
mortars  and seethed it in  pots and 
made cakes of it  and the taste of it 
was as the taste of a cake baked with 
                                                      
a that is burning  oil 9and when the dew fell upon the 
camp in the night  the manna fell upon 
it10and moses heard the people 
weeping  family by family  every man 
at the door of his tent  and the anger of 
the lord was kindled greatly  and 
moses was displeased  11and moses 
said unto the lord wherefore hast 
thou dealt ill with thy servant  and 
wherefore have i not found favour in 
thy sight  that thou layest the burden 
of all this people u pon me  12have i 
conceived all this people  have i 
brought them forth  that thou 
shouldest say unto me  carry them in 
thy bosom  as a nursing father carrieth 
the sucking child  unto the land which 
thou didst swear unto their fathers  
13whence should i have  flesh to give 
unto all this people  for they trouble 
me with their weeping  saying  give us 
flesh  that we may eat  14i am not able 
to bear all this people myself alone  
because it is too heavy for me  15and if 
thou deal thus with me  kill me  i pray 
thee  out of hand  if i have found 
favour in thy sight  and let me not 
look upon my wretchedness   
16and the lord said unto moses  
gather unto me seventy men of the 
elders of israel  whom thou knowest to 
be the elders of the people  and 
officers over them  and bring them 
unto the tent of meeting  that they may 
stand there with thee  17and i will 
come down and speak with thee there  
and i will take of the spirit which is 
upon thee  and will put it upon them  
and they shall bear the burden of the 11 numbers  
207 
 people with th ee that thou bear it not 
thyself alone  18and say thou unto the 
people  sanctify yourselves against to 
morrow  and ye shall eat flesh  for ye 
have wept in the ears of the lord 
saying  would that we were given 
flesh to eat  for it was well with us in 
egyp t therefore the lord will give 
you flesh  and ye shall eat  19ye shall 
not eat one day  nor two days  nor five 
days neither ten days  nor twenty 
days 20but a whole month  until it 
come out at your nostrils  and it be 
loathsome unto you  because that ye 
have rejected the lord who is among 
you and have troubled him with 
weeping  saying  why  now came we 
forth out of egypt  21and moses said  
the people  among whom i am  are 
six hundred thousand men on foot  and 
yet thou hast said  i will give them 
flesh  that they may eat a whole 
month  22if flocks and herds be slain 
for them  will they suffice them  or if 
all the fish of the sea be gathered 
together for them  will they suffice 
them  23and the lord said unto 
moses  is the l ords hand waxed 
short  now s halt thou see whether my 
word shall come to pass unto thee or 
not  
24and moses went out  and told the 
people the words of the lord and he 
gathered seventy men of the elders of 
the people  and set them round about 
the tent  25and the lord came down 
in th e cloud  and spoke unto him  and 
took of the spirit that was upon him  
and put it upon the seventy elders  and it came to pass  that when the spirit 
rested upon them  they prophesied  but 
they did so no more  26but there 
remained two men in the camp  the 
name of the one was eldad  and the 
name of the other medad  and the 
spirit rested upon them  and they were 
of them that were recorded  but had 
not gone out unto the tent  and they 
prophesied in the camp  27and there 
ran a young man  and told moses  and 
said eldad and medad are 
prophesying in the camp  28and 
joshua the son of nun  the minister of 
moses from his youth up  answered 
and said  my lord moses  shut them 
in 29and moses said unto him  art 
thou jealous for my sake  would that 
all the l ords people were prophets  
that the lord would put his spirit 
upon them   30and moses withdrew 
into the camp  he and the elders of 
israel   
31and there went forth a wind from 
the lord and brought across quails 
from the sea  and let them fall by the 
camp  about a day s journey on this 
side and a day s journey on the other 
side round about the camp  and about 
two cubits above the face of the earth  
32and the people rose up all that day  
and all the night  and all the next day  
and gathered the quails  he that 
gathered least gathered ten heaps  and 
they spread them all abroad for 
themselves round about the camp  
33while the flesh was yet between their 
teeth  ere it was chewed  the anger of 
the lord was kindled against the numbers  
208 
 people  and the lord smote the people 
with a very great plague  34and the 
name of that place was called kibroth 
hattaavah  because there they buried 
the people that lusted  35from 
akibroth hattaavah the people 
journeyed unto hazeroth  and they 
abode at hazeroth   
and miriam and aaron spoke 
against moses because of the 
cushite woman whom he had married  
for he had married a cushite woman  
2and they said  hath the lord indeed 
spoken only with moses  hath he not 
spoken also with us  and the lord 
heard it  3now the man moses was 
very meek  above all the men that 
were upon the face of the earth  
4and the lord spoke suddenly unto 
moses  and unto aaron  and unto 
miriam  come out ye three unto the 
tent of meeting  and they three came 
out 5and the lord came down in a 
pillar of cloud  and stood at t he door of 
the tent  and called aaron and 
miriam  and they both came forth  
6and he said  hear now my words  if 
there be a prophet among you  i the 
lord do make myself known unto him 
in a vision  i do speak with him in a 
dream  7my servant moses is not so  
he is trusted in all my house  8with 
him do i speak mouth to mouth  even 
manifestly  and not in dark speeches  
and the similitude of the lord doth he 
behold  wherefore then were ye not 
afraid to speak against my servant  
                                                      
a that is the graves of lust  against moses  9and the anger of  the 
lord was kindled against them  and 
he departed  10and when the cloud 
was removed from over the tent  
behold  miriam was leprous  as white 
as snow  and aaron looked upon 
miriam  and behold  she was leprous  
11and aaron said unto moses  oh my 
lord lay not  i pray thee  sin upon us  
for that we have done foolishly  and 
for that we have sinned  12let her not  i 
pray be as one dead  of whom the 
flesh is half consumed when he 
cometh out of his mother s womb  
13and moses cried unto the lord 
saying  heal her now  o god  i 
beseech thee   
14and the lord said unto moses  if 
her father had but spit in her face  
should she not hide in shame seven 
days let her be shut up without the 
camp seven days  and after that she 
shall be brought in again  15and 
miria m was shut up without the camp 
seven days  and the people journeyed 
not till miriam was brought in again  
16and afterward the people journeyed 
from hazeroth  and pitched in the 
wilderness of paran   
 
 
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2send thou 
men that they may spy out the land of 
canaan  which i give unto the children 
of israel  of every tribe of their fathers 
shall ye send a man  every one a prince 
among them  3and moses sent them 
from the wilderness of paran 12 
13 numbers  
209

16these are the names of the men that 
moses sent to spy out the land  and 
moses called hoshea the son of nun 
joshua  17and moses sent them to spy 
out the land of canaan  and said unto 
them  get you up here into the south  
and g o up into the mountains  18and 
see the land  what it is  and the people 
that dwelleth therein  whether they are 
strong or weak  whether they are few 
or many  19and what the land is that 
they dwell in  whether it is good or 
bad and what cities they are tha t they 
dwell in  whether in camps  or in 
strongholds  20and what the land is  
whether it is fat or lean  whether there 
is wood therein  or not  and be ye of 
good courage  and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time 
of the first ripe grap es 21so they 
went up  and spied out the land from 
the wilderness of zin unto rehob  at 
the entrance to hamath  22and they 
went up into the south  and came unto 
hebron  and ahiman  sheshai  and 
talmai  the children of anak  were 
there now hebron was buil t seven 
years before zoan in egypt  23and 
they came unto the valley of eshcol  
and cut down from thence a branch 
with one cluster of grapes  and they 
bore it upon a pole between two  they 
took also of the pomegranates  and of 
the figs  24that place was c alled the 
valley of aeshcol  because of the 
cluster which the children of israel cut 
down from thence  25and they 
returned from spying out the land at 
the end of forty days  26and they went 
and came to moses  and to aaron  and 
to all the congregation of t he children 
of israel  unto the wilderness of paran  
to kadesh  and brought back word 
unto them  and unto all the 
congregation  and showed them the 
fruit of the land  27and they told him  
and said  we came unto the land 
whither thou sentest us  and surely  it 
floweth with milk and honey  and this 
is the fruit of it  28howbeit the people 
that dwell in the land are fierce  and 
the cities are fortified  and very great  
and moreover we saw the children of 
anak there  29amalek dwelleth in the 
land of the south  and the hittite  and 
                                                      
a that is a cluster  numbers  
210 
 the jebusite  and the amorite  dwell in 
the mountains  and the canaanite 
dwelleth by the sea  and along by the 
side of the jordan  30and caleb stilled 
the people toward moses  and said  
we should go up at once  and possess 
it for we  are well able to overcome it  
31but the men that went up with him 
said we are not able to go up against 
the people  for they are stronger than 
we 32and they spread an evil report 
of the land which they had spied out 
unto the children of israel  sayin g 
the land  through which we have 
passed to spy it out  is a land that 
eateth up the inhabitants thereof  and 
all the people that we saw in it are men 
of great stature  33and there we saw 
the nephilim  the sons of anak  who 
come of the nephilim  and we w ere in 
our own sight as grasshoppers  and so 
we were in their sight   
and all the congregation lifted 
up their voice  and cried  and 
the people wept that night  2and all the 
children of israel murmured against 
moses and against aaron  and the 
whole con gregation said unto them  
would that we had died in the land of 
egypt  or would we had died in this 
wilderness  3and wherefore doth the 
lord bring us unto this land  to fall by 
the sword  our wives and our little 
ones will be a prey  were it not better 
for us to return into egypt  4and they 
said one to another  let us make a 
captain  and let us return into egypt  
5then moses and aaron fell on their 
faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel  
6and joshua the son of nun an d caleb 
the son of jephunneh  who were of 
them that spied out the land  rent their 
clothes  7and they spoke unto all the 
congregation of the children of israel  
saying  the land  which we passed 
through to spy it out  is an exceeding 
good land  8if the lord delight in us  
then he will bring us into this land  
and give it unto us a land which 
floweth with milk and honey  9only 
rebel not against the lord neither fear 
ye the people of the land  for they are 
bread for us  their defence is removed 
from over th em and the lord is with 
us fear them not  10but all the 
congregation bade stone them with 
stones  when the glory of the lord 
appeared in the tent of meeting unto all 
the children of israel   
11and the lord said unto moses  
how long will this people des pise 
me and how long will they not 
believe in me  for all the signs which i 
have wrought among them  12i will 
smite them with the pestilence  and 
destroy them  and will make of thee a 
nation greater and mightier than they  
13and moses said unto the lord 
when the egyptians shall hear for 
thou broughtest up this people in thy 
might from among them 14they will 
say to the inhabitants of this land  who 
have heard that thou lord art in the 
midst of this people  inasmuch as 
thou lord art seen face to face  and 
thy cloud standeth over them  and 
thou goest before them  in a pillar of 14 numbers  
211 
 cloud by day  and in a pillar of fire by 
night  15now if thou shalt kill this 
people as one man  then the nations 
which have heard the fame of thee 
will speak  saying  16because the lord 
was not able to bring this people into 
the land which he swore unto them  
therefore he hath slain them in the 
wilderness  17and now  i pray thee  
let the power of the lord be great  
according as thou hast spoken  
saying  18the lord is slow to anger  
and plenteous in lovingkindness  
forgiving iniquity and transgression  
and that will by no means clear the 
guilty  visiting the iniquity of the 
fathers upon the children  upon the 
third and upon the fourth generation  
19pardon  i pray thee  the iniquity of 
this people according unto the 
greatness of thy lovingkindness  and 
according as thou hast forgiven this 
people  from egypt even until now  
20and the lord said i have pardoned 
according to thy word 21but in very 
deed  as i live and all the earth shall 
be filled with the glory of the lord 
22surely all those men that have seen 
my glory  and my signs  which i 
wrought in egypt and in the 
wilderness  yet have put me to proof 
these ten times  and have not 
hearkened to my voice  23surely they 
shall not see the  land which i swore 
unto their fathers  neither shall any of 
them that despised me see it  24but my 
servant caleb  because he had another 
spirit with him  and hath followed me 
fully  him will i bring into the land whereinto he went  and his seed shall 
possess it  25now the amalekite and 
the canaanite dwell in the vale  
tomorrow turn ye  and get you into the 
wilderness by the way to the red sea   
26and the lord spoke unto moses 
and unto aaron  saying  27how long 
shall i bear with this evil congregation  
that keep murmuring against me  i 
have heard the murmurings of the 
children of israel  which they keep 
murmuring against me  28say unto 
them  as i live  saith the lord surely 
as ye have spoken in mine ears  so will 
i do to you  29your carcasses shall fall 
in this wilderness  and all that were 
numbered of you  according to your 
whole number  from twenty years old 
and upward  ye that have murmured 
against me  30surely ye shall not come 
into the land  concerning which i lifted 
up my hand that i would make you 
dwell therein  save caleb the son of 
jephunneh  and joshua the son of nun  
31but your little ones  that ye said 
would be a prey  them will i bring in  
and they shall know the land which ye 
have rejected  32but as for you  your 
carcasses shall fall in this w ilderness  
33and your children shall be wanderers 
in the wilderness forty years  and shall 
bear your strayings  until your 
carcasses be consumed in the 
wilderness  34after the number of the 
days in which ye spied out the land  
even forty days  for every da y a year  
shall ye bear your iniquities  even forty 
years  and ye shall know my 
displeasure  35i the lord have spoken  numbers  
212 
 surely this will i do unto all this evil 
congregation  that are gathered 
together against me  in this wilderness 
they shall be consumed  and there they 
shall die  36and the men  whom 
moses sent to spy out the land  and 
who when they returned  made all the 
congregation to murmur against him  
by bringing up an evil report against 
the land  37even those men that did 
bring up an evil report o f the land  died 
by the plague before the lord 38but 
joshua the son of nun  and caleb the 
son of jephunneh  remained alive of 
those men that went to spy out the 
land 39and moses told these words 
unto all the children of israel  and the 
people mourned gre atly 40and they 
rose up early in the morning  and got 
them up to the top of the mountain  
saying  lo we are here  and will go 
up unto the place which the lord hath 
promised  for we have sinned  41and 
moses said  wherefore now do ye 
transgress the comm andment of the 
lord seeing it shall not prosper  42go 
not up  for the lord is not among you  
that ye be not smitten down before 
your enemies  43for there the 
amalekite and the canaanite are 
before you  and ye shall fall by the 
sword  forasmuch as ye are t urned 
back from following the lord and the 
lord will not be with you  44but they 
presumed to go up to the top of the 
mountain  nevertheless the ark of the 
covenant of the lord and moses  
departed not out of the camp  45then 
the amalekite and the canaani te who dwelt in that hill country  came down  
and smote them and beat them down  
even unto hormah   
 
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2speak unto 
the children of israel  and say unto 
them   
when ye are come into the land of 
your habitations  whic h i give unto 
you 3and will make an offering by fire 
unto the lord a burnt offering  or a 
sacrifice  in fulfilment of a vow clearly 
uttered  or as a freewill offering  or in 
your appointed seasons  to make a 
sweet savour unto the lord of the 
herd or of  the flock  4then shall he that 
bringeth his offering present unto the 
lord a meal offering of a tenth part of 
an ephah of fine flour mingled with the 
fourth part of a hin of oil  5and wine 
for the drink offering  the fourth part 
of a hin  shalt thou prepa re with the 
burnt offering or for the sacrifice  for 
each lamb  6or for a ram  thou shalt 
prepare for a meal offering two tenth 
parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled 
with the third part of a hin of oil  7and 
for the drink offering thou shalt 
present the third part of a hin of wine  
of a sweet savour unto the lord 8and 
when thou preparest a bullock for a 
burnt offering  or for a sacrifice  in 
fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered  or 
for peace offerings unto the lord 
9then shall there be presented with the  
bullock a meal offering of three tenth 
parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled 
with half a hin of oil  10and thou shalt 15 numbers  
213 
 present for the drink offering half a 
hin of wine  for an offering made by 
fire of a sweet savour unto the lord 
11thus shall it be do ne for each 
bullock  or for each ram  or for each of 
the he lambs  or of the kids  
12according to the number that ye may 
prepare  so shall ye do for every one 
according to their number  13all that 
are home born shall do these things 
after this manner  in p resenting an 
offering made by fire  of a sweet 
savour unto the lord 14and if a 
stranger sojourn with you  or 
whosoever may be among you  
throughout your generations  and will 
offer an offering made by fire  of a 
sweet savour unto the lord as ye do  
so he  shall do  15as for the 
congregation  there shall be one statute 
both for you  and for the stranger that 
sojourneth with you  a statute for ever 
throughout your generations  as ye are  
so shall the stranger be before the 
lord 16one law and one ordinance 
shall be both for you  and for the 
stranger that sojourneth with you   
 
17and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  18speak unto the children of 
israel  and say unto them   
when ye come into the land whither 
i bring you  19then it shall be  that 
when ye eat o f the bread of the land  
ye shall set apart a portion for a gift 
unto the lord 20of the first of your 
dough ye shall set apart a cake for a 
gift as that which is set apart of the 
threshing floor  so shall ye set it apart  21of the first of your dough ye shall 
give unto the lord a portion for a gift 
throughout your generations   
 
22and when ye shall err  and not 
observe all these commandments  
which the lord hath spoken unto 
moses  23even all that the lord hath 
commanded you by the hand of 
moses  from the day that the lord 
gave commandment  and onward 
throughout your generations  24then it 
shall be  if it be done in error by the 
congregation  it being hid from their 
eyes that all the congregation shall 
offer one young bullock for a burnt 
offering  for a sw eet savour unto the 
lordwith the meal offering thereof  
and the drink offering thereof  
according to the ordinance and one 
hegoat for a sin offering  25and the 
priest shall make atonement for all the 
congregation of the children of israel  
and they shall  be forgiven  for it was 
an error  and they have brought their 
offering  an offering made by fire unto 
the lord and their sin offering before 
the lord for their error  26and all the 
congregation of the children of israel 
shall be forgiven  and the strang er that 
sojourneth among them  for in respect 
of all the people it was done in error   
27and if one person sin through 
error  then he shall offer a she goat of 
the first year for a sin offering  28and 
the priest shall make atonement for the 
soul that erret h when he sinneth 
through error  before the lord to 
make atonement for him  and he shall numbers  
214 
 be forgiven  29both he that is home 
born among the children of israel  and 
the stranger that sojourneth among 
them  ye shall have one law for him 
that doeth aught in  error  30but the soul 
that doeth aught with a high hand  
whether he be home born or a 
stranger  the same blasphemeth the 
lord and that soul shall be cut off 
from among his people  31because he 
hath despised the word of the lord 
and hath broken his comma ndment  
that soul shall utterly be cut off  his 
iniquity shall be upon him   
 
32and while the children of israel 
were in the wilderness  they found a 
man gathering sticks upon the sabbath 
day 33and they that found him 
gathering sticks brought him unto 
moses and aaron  and unto all the 
congregation  34and they put him in 
ward  because it had not been declared 
what should be done to him  35and the 
lord said unto moses  the man shall 
surely be put to death  all the 
congregation shall stone him with 
stones wi thout the camp  36and all the 
congregation brought him without the 
camp  and stoned him with stones  and 
he died  as the lord commanded 
moses   
37and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  38speak unto the children of 
israel  and bid them that they make 
them  throughout their generations 
fringes in the corners of their 
garments  and that they put with the 
fringe of each corner a thread of blue  39and it shall be unto you for a fringe  
that ye may look upon it  and 
remember all the commandments of 
the lord and do them  and that ye go 
not about after your own heart and 
your own eyes  after which ye use to 
go astray  40that ye may remember and 
do all my commandments  and be holy 
unto your god  41i am the lord your 
god who brought you out of the land 
of egypt  to be your god  i am the 
lord your god   
 
now korah  the son of izhar  
the son of kohath  the son of 
levi with dathan and abiram  the 
sons of eliab  and on  the son of 
peleth  sons of reuben  took men  2and 
they rose up in face of moses  with 
certain  of the children of israel  two 
hundred and fifty men  they were 
princes of the congregation  the elect 
men of the assembly  men of renown  
3and they assembled themselves 
together against moses and against 
aaron  and said unto them  ye take 
too much upon you seeing all the 
congregation are holy  every one of 
them  and the lord is among them  
wherefore then lift ye up yourselves 
above the assembly of the lord 
4and when moses heard it  he fell 
upon his face  5and he spoke unto 
korah and unto all his compa ny 
saying  in the morning the lord will 
show who are his  and who is holy  
and will cause him to come near unto 
him even him whom he may choose 
will he cause to come near unto him  16 numbers  
215 
 6this do  take you censors  korah  and 
all his company  7and put fire th erein  
and put incense upon them before the 
lord tomorrow  and it shall be that 
the man whom the lord doth choose  
he shall be holy  ye take too much 
upon you  ye sons of levi  8and 
moses said unto korah  hear now  ye 
sons of levi  9is it but a small th ing 
unto you  that the god of israel hath 
separated you from the congregation 
of israel  to bring you near to himself  
to do the service of the tabernacle of 
the lord and to stand before the 
congregation to minister unto them  
10and that he hath brought t hee near  
and all thy brethren the sons of levi 
with thee  and will ye seek the 
priesthood also  11therefore thou and 
all thy company that are gathered 
together against the lord and as to 
aaron  what is he that ye murmur 
against him  12and moses sent to  call 
dathan and abiram  the sons of eliab  
and they said  we will not come up  
13is it a small thing that thou hast 
brought us up out of a land flowing 
with milk and honey  to kill us in the 
wilderness  but thou must needs make 
thyself also a prince over  us 
14moreover thou hast not brought us 
into a land flowing with milk and 
honey  nor given us inheritance of 
fields and vineyards  wilt thou put out 
the eyes of these men  we will not 
come up  15and moses was very 
wroth  and said unto the lord 
respect not thou their offering  i have 
not taken one ass from them  neither have i hurt one of them  16and moses 
said unto korah  be thou and all thy 
congregation before the lord thou 
and they  and aaron  tomorrow  17and 
take ye every man his fire pan and p ut 
incense upon them  and bring ye 
before the lord every man his fire 
pan two hundred and fifty fire pans 
thou also  and aaron  each his fire 
pan 18and they took every man his 
firepan and put fire in them  and laid 
incense thereon  and stood at the d oor 
of the tent of meeting with moses and 
aaron  19and korah assembled all the 
congregation against them unto the 
door of the tent of meeting  and the 
glory of the lord appeared unto all the 
congregation   
20and the lord spoke unto moses 
and unto aaron  saying 21separate 
yourselves from among this 
congregation  that i may consume 
them in a moment  22and they fell 
upon their faces  and said  o god  the 
god of the spirits of all flesh  shall one 
man sin  and wilt thou be wroth with 
all the congregation   
23and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  24speak unto the 
congregation  saying  get you up from 
about the dwelling of korah  dathan  
and abiram  25and moses rose up and 
went unto dathan and abiram  and the 
elders of israel followed him  26and he 
spoke u nto the congregation  saying  
depart  i pray you  from the tents of 
these wicked men  and touch nothing 
of theirs  lest ye be swept away in all 
their sins  27so they got them up from numbers  
216 
 the dwelling of korah  dathan  and 
abiram  on every side  and dathan an d 
abiram came out  and stood at the 
door of their tents  with their wives  
and their sons  and their little ones  
28and moses said  hereby ye shall 
know that the lord hath sent me to do 
all these works  and that i have not 
done them of mine own mind  29if 
these men die the common death of all 
men and be visited after the visitation 
of all men  then the lord hath not sent 
me 30but if the lord make a new 
thing  and the ground open her mouth  
and swallow them up  with all that 
appertain unto them  and they go down 
alive into the pit  then ye shall 
understand that these men have 
despised the lord 31and it came to 
pass as he made an end of speaking all 
these words  that the ground did cleave 
asunder that was under them  32and 
the earth opened her mouth and 
swallowed them up  and their 
households  and all the men that 
appertained unto korah  and all their 
goods  33so they  and all that 
appertained to them  went down alive 
into the pit  and the earth closed upon 
them  and they perished from among 
the assembly  34and all israel that 
were round about them fled at the cry 
of them  for they said  lest the earth 
swallow us up  35and fire came forth 
from the lord and devoured the two 
hundred and fifty men that offered the 
incense   
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2speak  unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest  
that he take up the fire pans out of the 
burning  and scatter thou the fire 
yonder  for they are become holy  
3even the fire pans of these men who 
have sinned at the cost of their lives  
and let t hem be made beaten plates for 
a covering of the altar for they are 
become holy  because they were 
offered before the l ordthat they 
may be a sign unto the children of 
israel  4and eleazar the priest took 
the brazen fire pans which they that 
were burnt ha d offered  and they beat 
them out for a covering of the altar  5to 
be a memorial unto the children of 
israel  to the end that no common man  
that is not of the seed of aaron  draw 
near to burn incense before the lord 
that he fare not as korah  and as his 
company  as the lord spoke unto him 
by the hand of moses   
6but on the morrow all the 
congregation of the children of israel 
murmured against moses and against 
aaron  saying  ye have killed the 
people of the lord 7and it came to 
pass when the congregat ion was 
assembled against moses and against 
aaron  that they looked toward the tent 
of meeting  and behold  the cloud 
covered it  and the glory of the lord 
appeared  8and moses and aaron 
came to the front of the tent of 
meeting  9and the lord spoke unto 
moses saying  10get you up from 
among this congregation  that i may 
consume them in a moment  and they 
fell upon their faces  11and moses said 17 numbers  
217 
 unto aaron  take thy fire pan and 
put fire therein from off the altar  and 
lay incense thereon  and carry it 
quickly unto the congregation  and 
make atonement for them  for there is 
wrath gone out from the lord the 
plague is begun  12and aaron took as 
moses spoke  and ran into the midst of 
the assembly  and behold  the plague 
was begun among the people  and he  
put on the incense  and made 
atonement for the people  13and he 
stood between the dead and the living  
and the plague was stayed  14now they 
that died by the plague were fourteen 
thousand and seven hundred  besides 
them that died about the matter of 
korah  15and aaron returned unto 
moses unto the door of the tent of 
meeting  and the plague was stayed   
16and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  17speak  unto the children of 
israel  and take of them rods  one for 
each fathers house  of all their princes 
accor ding to their fathers houses  
twelve rods  thou shalt write every 
mans name upon his rod  18and thou 
shalt write aaron s name upon the rod 
of levi  for there shall be one rod for 
the head of their fathers houses  19and 
thou shalt lay them up in the tent o f 
meeting before the testimony  where i 
meet with you  20and it shall come to 
pass that the man whom i shall 
choose  his rod shall bud  and i will 
make to cease from me the 
murmurings of the children of israel  
which they murmur against you  
21and moses spoke unto the children of israel  and all their princes gave him 
rods for each prince one  according to 
their fathers houses  even twelve rods  
and the rod of aaron was among their 
rods 22and moses laid up the rods 
before the lord in the tent of the 
testimony  23and it came to pass on the 
morrow  that moses went into the tent 
of the testimony  and behold  the rod 
of aaron for the house of levi was 
budded  and put forth buds  and 
bloomed blossoms  and bore ripe 
almonds  24and moses brought out all 
the ro ds from before the lord unto all 
the children of israel  and they looked  
and took every man his rod   
25and the lord said unto moses  
put back the rod of aaron before the 
testimony  to be kept there  for a token 
against the rebellious children  that 
there may be made an end of their 
murmurings against me  that they die 
not 26thus did moses  as the lord 
commanded him  so did he   
27and the children of israel spoke 
unto moses  saying  behold  we 
perish  we are undone  we are all 
undone  28every one that cometh near  
that cometh near unto the tabernacle of 
the lord is to die  shall we wholly 
perish   
and the lord said unto aaron  
thou and thy sons and thy 
fathers house with thee shall bear the 
iniquity of the sanctuary  and thou and 
thy sons with the e shall bear the 
iniquity of your priesthood  2and thy 
brethren also  the tribe of levi  the 
tribe of thy father  bring thou near with 18 numbers  
218 
 thee that they may be joined unto 
thee and minister unto thee  thou and 
thy sons with thee being before the 
tent of the  testimony  3and they shall 
keep thy charge  and the charge of all 
the tent  only they shall not come nigh 
unto the holy furniture and unto the 
altar that they die not  neither they  
nor ye  4and they shall be joined unto 
thee and keep the charge of the tent of 
meeting  whatsoever the service of the 
tent may be  but a common man shall 
not draw nigh unto you  5and ye shall 
keep the charge of the holy things  and 
the charge of the altar  that there be 
wrath no more upon the children of 
israel  6and i  behol d i have taken 
your brethren the levites from among 
the children of israel  for you they are 
given as a gift unto the lord to do the 
service of the tent of meeting  7and 
thou and thy sons with thee shall keep 
your priesthood in everything that 
pertaineth  to the altar  and to that 
within the veil  and ye shall serve  i 
give you the priesthood as a service of 
gift and the common man that 
draweth nigh shall be put to death   
8and the lord spoke unto aaron  
and i  behold  i have given thee the 
charge of my  heave offerings  even of 
all the hallowed things of the children 
of israel unto thee have i given them 
for a consecrated portion  and to thy 
sons as a due for ever  9this shall be 
thine of the most holy things  reserved 
from the fire  every offering of t heirs  
even every meal offering of theirs  and 
every sin offering of theirs  and every guiltoffering of theirs  which they 
may render unto me  shall be most 
holy for thee and for thy sons  10in a 
most holy place shalt thou eat thereof  
every male may eat thereof  it shall be 
holy unto thee  11and this is thine  the 
heave offering of their gift  even all 
the wave offerings of the children of 
israel  i have given them unto thee  
and to thy sons and to thy daughters 
with thee  as a due for ever  every one 
that is clean in thy house may eat 
thereof  12all the best of the oil  and all 
the best of the wine  and of the corn  
the first part of them which they give 
unto the lord to thee have i given 
them  13the first ripe fruits of all that 
is in their land  which they bring unto 
the lord shall be thine  every one that 
is clean in thy house may eat thereof  
14every thing devoted in israel shall be 
thine  15every thing that openeth the 
womb  of all flesh which they offer 
unto the lord both of man and beast  
shall b e thine  howbeit the first born of 
man shalt thou surely redeem  and the 
firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou 
redeem  16and their redemption 
money from a month old shalt thou 
redeem them shall be  according to 
thy valuation  five shekels of silver  
after the shekel of the sanctuary the 
same is twenty gerahs  17but the 
firstling of an ox  or the firstling of a 
sheep  or the firstling of a goat  thou 
shalt not redeem  they are holy  thou 
shalt dash their blood against the altar  
and shalt make their fat smo ke for an 
offering made by fire  for a sweet numbers  
219 
 savour unto the lord 18and the flesh 
of them shall be thine  as the wave 
breast and as the right thigh  it shall be 
thine  19all the heave offerings of the 
holy things  which the children of 
israel offer unto t he lord have i given 
thee and thy sons and thy daughters 
with thee  as a due for ever  it is an 
everlasting covenant of salt before the 
lord unto thee and to thy seed with 
thee  
20and the lord said unto aaron  
thou shalt have no inheritance in 
their l and neither shalt thou have any 
portion among them  i am thy portion 
and thine inheritance among the 
children of israel  21and unto the 
children of levi  behold  i have given 
all the tithe in israel for an inheritance  
in return for their service which th ey 
serve  even the service of the tent of 
meeting  22and henceforth the children 
of israel shall not come nigh the tent 
of meeting  lest they bear sin  and die  
23but the levites alone shall do the 
service of the tent of meeting  and they 
shall bear their iniquity  it shall be a 
statute for ever throughout your 
generations  and among the children of 
israel they shall have no inheritance  
24for the tithe of the children of israel  
which they set apart as a gift unto the 
lord i have given to the levites for 
an inheritance  therefore i have said 
unto them  among the children of 
israel they shall have no inheritance   
25and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  26moreover thou shalt speak 
unto the levites  and say unto them  when ye take of the children of israe l 
the tithe which i have given you from 
them for your inheritance  then ye 
shall set apart of it a gift for the lord 
even a tithe of the tithe  27and the gift 
which ye set apart shall be reckoned 
unto you  as though it were the corn of 
the threshing floor  and as the fulness 
of the wine press  28thus ye also shall 
set apart a gift unto the lord of all 
your tithes  which ye receive of the 
children of israel  and thereof ye shall 
give the gift which is set apart unto the 
lord to aaron the priest  29out of al l 
that is given you ye shall set apart all 
of that which is due unto the lord of 
all the best thereof  even the hallowed 
part thereof out of it  30therefore thou 
shalt say unto them  when ye set apart 
the best thereof from it  then it shall be 
counted unt o the levites as the 
increase of the threshing floor  and as 
the increase of the wine press  31and 
ye may eat it in every place  ye and 
your households  for it is your reward 
in return for your service in the tent of 
meeting  32and ye shall bear no sin by 
reason of it  seeing that ye have set 
apart from it the best thereof  and ye 
shall not profane the holy things of the 
children of israel  that ye die not   
 
 
and the lord spoke unto 
moses and unto aaron  
saying   
2this is the statute of the law which 
the lord hath commanded  saying  
speak unto the children of israel  that 19 numbers  
220 
 they bring thee a red heifer  faultless  
wherein is no blemish  and upon which 
neve r came yoke  3and ye shall give 
her unto eleazar the priest  and she

10and he that gathereth the ashes of 
the heifer shall wash his clothes  and

15and every open vessel  which hath 
no covering close bound upon it  is

the unclean person toucheth shall be

and the children of israel  
even the whole congregation  
came into the wilderness of zin in the 
first month  and the people abode in 
kadesh  and miriam died there  and 
was buried there  2and there was no 
water for the congregation  and they 
assembled themselves together against 
moses and against aaron  3and the 
people strove with moses  and spoke  
saying  would that we had perished 
when our bre thren perished before the 
lord 4and why have ye brought the 
assembly of the lord into this 
wilderness  to die there  we and our 
cattle  5and wherefore have ye made 
us to come up out of egypt  to bring us 
in unto this evil place  it is no place of 
seed or of figs  or of vines  or of 
pomegranates  neither is there any 
water to drink  6and moses and 
aaron went from the presence of the 
assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting  and fell upon their faces  and 
the glory of the lord appeared unto 
them  7and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  8take the rod  and 
assemble the congregation  thou and 
aaron thy brother  and speak ye unto 
the rock before their eyes  that it give 
forth its water  and thou shalt bring 
forth to them water out of the rock  so 
thou sh alt give the congregation and 
their cattle drink  9and moses took 
the rod from before the lord as he 
commanded him  10and moses and 
aaron gathered the assembly together 
before the rock  and he said unto them  
hear now  ye rebels  are we to bring 
you for th water out of this rock  
11and moses lifted up his hand  and 
smote the rock with his rod twice  and 
water came forth abundantly  and the 
congregation drank  and their cattle  
12and the lord said unto moses and 
aaron  because ye believed not in 
me to sanctify me in the eyes of the 
children of israel  therefore ye shall 
not bring this assembly into the land 
which i have given them  13these are 
the waters of ameribah  where the 
children of israel strove with the lord 
and he was sanctified in them   
14and moses sent messengers from 
kadesh unto the king of edom  thus 
saith thy brother israel  thou knowest 
all the travail that hath befallen us  
15how our fathers went down into 
egypt  and we dwelt in egypt a long 
time and the egyptians dealt ill with 
                                                      
a that is strife  20 numbers  
222 
 us and our fathers  16and when we 
cried unto the lord he heard our 
voice  and sent an angel  and brought 
us forth out of egypt  and behold  we 
are in kadesh  a city in the uttermost 
of thy border  17let us pass  i pray 
thee through thy land  we will not 
pass through field or through vineyard  
neither will we drink of the water of 
the wells  we will go along the king s 
highway  we will not turn aside to the 
right hand nor to the left  until we have 
passed thy border  18and edom said 
unto him  thou shalt not  pass through 
me lest i come out with the sword 
against thee  19and the children of 
israel said unto him  we will go up 
by the highway  and if we drink of thy 
water  i and my cattle  then will i give 
the price thereof  let me only pass 
through on my fee t there is no hurt  
20and he said  thou shalt not pass 
through  and edom came out against 
him with much people  and with a 
strong hand  21thus edom refused to 
give israel passage through his border  
wherefore israel turned away from 
him  
22and they jo urneyed from kadesh  
and the children of israel  even the 
whole congregation  came unto mount 
hor 23and the lord spoke unto moses 
and aaron in mount hor  by the border 
of the land of edom  saying  24aaron 
shall be gathered unto his people  for 
he shall n ot enter into the land which i 
have given unto the children of israel  
because ye rebelled against my word 
at the waters of meribah  25take aaron and eleazar his son  and bring them up 
unto mount hor  26and strip aaron of 
his garments  and put them upon 
eleazar his son  and aaron shall be 
gathered unto his people  and shall die 
there  27and moses did as the lord 
commanded  and they went up into 
mount hor in the sight of all the 
congregation  28and moses stripped 
aaron of his garments  and put them 
upon ele azar his son  and aaron died 
there in the top of the mount  and 
moses and eleazar came down from 
the mount  29and when all the 
congregation saw that aaron was 
dead  they wept for aaron thirty days  
even all the house of israel   
 
and the canaanite  the king of 
arad  who dwelt in the south  
heard tell that israel came by the way 
of atharim  and he fought against 
israel  and took some of them captive  
2and israel vowed a vow unto the 
lord and said  if thou wilt indeed 
deliver this people into my hand  then 
i will utterly destroy their cities  3and 
the lord hearkened to the voice of 
israel  and delivered up the 
canaanites  and they utterly destroyed 
them and their cities  and the name of 
the place was called ahormah   
4and they journeyed from mount 
hor by  the way to the red sea  to 
compass the land of edom  and the 
soul of the people became impatient 
because of the way  5and the people 
                                                      
a that is utter destruction  21 numbers  
223 
 spoke against god  and against moses  
wherefore have ye brought us up out 
of egypt to die in the wilderness  for 
there is  no bread  and there is no 
water  and our soul loatheth this light 
bread  6and the lord sent fiery 
serpents among the people  and they 
bit the people  and much people of 
israel died  7and the people came to 
moses  and said  we have sinned  
because we hav e spoken against the 
lord and against thee  pray unto the 
lord that he take away the serpents 
from us  and moses prayed for the 
people  8and the lord said unto 
moses  make thee a fiery serpent  and 
set it upon a pole  and it shall come to 
pass that ev ery one that is bitten  
when he seeth it  shall live  9and 
moses made a serpent of brass  and set 
it upon the pole  and it came to pass  
that if a serpent had bitten any man  
when he looked unto the serpent of 
brass  he lived  10and the children of 
israel  journeyed  and pitched in oboth  
11and they journeyed from oboth  and 
pitched at ije abarim  in the wilderness 
which is in front of moab  toward the 
sunrising  12from thence they 
journeyed  and pitched in the valley of 
zered  13from thence they journeyed  
and pitched on the other side of the 
arnon  which is in the wilderness  that 
cometh out of the border of the 
amorites for arnon is the border of 
moab  between moab and the 
amorites  14wherefore it is said in the 
book of the wars of the lord  
vaheb in s uphah   and the valleys of arnon   
15and the slope of the valleys  
that inclineth toward the seat of ar   
and leaneth upon the border of 
moab  
16and from thence to abeer  that is 
the well whereof the lord said unto 
moses  gather the people together  
and i will give them water  17then 
sang israel this song   
spring up  o well sing ye unto 
it 
18the well  which the princes 
digged   
which the nobles of the people 
delved   
with the sceptre  and with their 
staves   
and from the wilderness to 
mattanah  19and f rom mattanah to 
nahaliel  and from nahaliel to 
bamoth  20and from bamoth to the 
valley that is in the field of moab  by 
the top of pisgah  which looketh down 
upon the desert   
21and israel sent messengers unto 
sihon king of the amorites  saying  
22let me pass through thy land  we 
will not turn aside into field  or into 
vineyard  we will not drink of the 
water of the wells  we will go by the 
kings highway  until we have passed 
thy border  23and sihon would not 
suffer israel to pass through his 
border  but sihon gathered all his 
people together  and went out against 
israel into the wilderness  and came to 
                                                      
a that is a well numbers  
224 
 jahaz  and he fought against israel  
24and israel smote him with the edge 
of the sword  and possessed his land 
from the arnon unto the jabbok  even 
unto t he children of ammon  for the 
border of the children of ammon was 
strong  25and israel took all these 
cities  and israel dwelt in all the cities 
of the amorites  in heshbon  and in all 
the towns thereof  26for heshbon was 
the city of sihon the king of the 
amorites  who had fought against the 
former king of moab  and taken all his 
land out of his hand  even unto the 
arnon  27wherefore they that speak in 
parables say   
come ye to heshbon   
let the city of sihon be built and 
established   
28for a fire is gone out of heshbon   
a flame from the city of sihon   
it hath devoured ar of moab   
the lords of the high places of 
arnon   
29woe to thee  moab   
thou art undone  o people of 
chemosh   
he hath given his sons as fugitives   
and his daughters into captivity   
unto sihon king of the amorites   
30we have shot at them heshbon 
is perished even unto dibon   
and we have laid waste even unto 
nophah   
which reacheth unto medeba   
31thus israel dwelt in the land of the 
amorites  32and moses sent to spy out 
jazer  and they  took the towns thereof  
and drove out the amorites that were there  33and they turned and went up 
by the way of bashan  and og the king 
of bashan went out against them  he 
and all his people  to battle at edrei  
34and the lord said unto moses  fear 
him n ot for i have delivered him into 
thy hand  and all his people  and his 
land and thou shalt do to him as thou 
didst unto sihon king of the amorites  
who dwelt at heshbon  35so they 
smote him  and his sons  and all his 
people  until there was none left hi m 
remaining  and they possessed his 
land  
and the children of israel 
journeyed  and pitched in the 
plains of moab beyond the jordan at 
jericho   
 
2and balak the son of zippor saw 
all that israel had done to the 
amorites  3and moab was sore afraid 
of the people  because they were 
many  and moab was overcome with 
dread because of the children of israel  
4and moab said unto the elders of 
midian  now will this multitude lick 
up all that is round about us  as the ox 
licketh up the grass of the field and 
balak the son of zippor was king of 
moab at that time  5and he sent 
messengers unto balaam the son of 
beor  to pethor  which is by the river  
to the land of the children of his 
people  to call him  saying  behold  
there is a people come out from egypt  
behold  they cover the face of the 
earth  and they abide over against me  
6come now therefore  i pray thee  22 numbers  
225 
 curse me this people  for they are too 
mighty for me  peradventure i shall 
prevail  that we may smite them  and 
that i may drive them out of the land  
for i know that he whom thou blessest 
is blessed  and he whom thou cursest 
is cursed  7and the elders of moab 
and the elders of midian departed with 
the rewards of divination in their hand  
and they came unto balaam  and spoke 
unto him the words of balak  8and he 
said unto them  lodge here this night  
and i will bring you back word  as the 
lord may speak unto me  and the 
princes of moab abode wi th balaam  
9and god came unto balaam  and 
said what men are these with thee  
10and balaam said unto god  balak 
the son of zippor  king of moab  hath 
sent unto me saying  11behold the 
people that is come out of egypt  it 
covereth the face of the earth  now 
come curse me them  peradventure i 
shall be able to fight against them  and 
shall drive them out  12and god said 
unto balaam  thou shalt not go with 
them  thou shalt not curse the people  
for they are blessed  13and balaam 
rose up in the morning  and said unto 
the princes of balak  get you into 
your land  for the lord refuseth to 
give me leave to go with you  14and 
the princes of moab rose up  and they 
went unto balak  and said  balaam 
refuseth to come with us  15and balak 
sent yet again princ es more  and more 
honourable than they  16and they came 
to balaam  and said to him  thus 
saith balak the son of zippor  let nothing  i pray thee  hinder thee from 
coming unto me  17for i will promote 
thee unto very great honour  and 
whatsoever thou sayes t unto me i will 
do come therefore  i pray thee  curse 
me this people  18and balaam 
answered and said unto the servants of 
balak  if balak would give me his 
house full of silver and gold  i cannot 
go beyond the word of the lord my 
god to do any thing  small or great  
19now therefore  i pray you  tarry ye 
also here this night  that i may know 
what the lord will speak unto me 
more  20and god came unto balaam 
at night  and said unto him  if the men 
are come to call thee  rise up  go with 
them  but only t he word which i speak 
unto thee  that shalt thou do  21and 
balaam rose up in the morning  and 
saddled his ass  and went with the 
princes of moab  22and god s anger 
was kindled because he went  and the 
angel of the lord placed himself in the 
way for an adv ersary against him 
now he was riding upon his ass  and 
his two servants were with him  
23and the ass saw the angel of the 
lord standing in the way  with his 
sword drawn in his hand  and the ass 
turned aside out of the way  and went 
into the field  and ba laam smote the 
ass to turn her into the way  24then 
the angel of the lord stood in a hollow 
way between the vineyards  a fence 
being on this side  and a fence on that 
side 25and the ass saw the angel of the 
lord and she thrust herself unto the 
wall and crushed balaam s foot numbers  
226 
 against the wall  and he smote her 
again  26and the angel of the lord 
went further  and stood in a narrow 
place  where was no way to turn either 
to the right hand or to the left  27and 
the ass saw the angel of the lord and 
she lay d own under balaam  and 
balaam s anger was kindled  and he 
smote the ass with his staff  28and the 
lord opened the mouth of the ass  and 
she said unto balaam  what have i 
done unto thee  that thou hast smitten 
me these three times  29and balaam 
said unto t he ass  because thou hast 
mocked me  i would there were a 
sword in my hand  for now i had killed 
thee 30and the ass said unto balaam  
am not i thine ass  upon which thou 
hast ridden all thy life long unto this 
day was i ever wont to do so unto 
thee and he said  nay 31then the 
lord opened the eyes of balaam  and 
he saw the angel of the lord standing 
in the way  with his sword drawn in 
his hand  and he bowed his head  and 
fell on his face  32and the angel of the 
lord said unto him  wherefore hast 
thou smitten thine ass these three 
times  behold  i am come forth for an 
adversary  because thy way is contrary 
unto me  33and the ass saw me  and 
turned aside before me these three 
times  unless she had turned aside 
from me  surely now i had even slain 
thee and saved her alive  34and 
balaam said unto the angel of the 
lord i have sinned  for i knew not 
that thou stoodest in the way against 
me now therefore  if it displease thee  i will get me back  35and the angel of 
the lord said unto balaam  go with  
the men  but only the word that i shall 
speak unto thee  that thou shalt speak  
so balaam went with the princes of 
balak  36and when balak heard that 
balaam was come  he went out to meet 
him unto ir moab  which is on the 
border of arnon  which is in the 
utmost part of the border  37and balak 
said unto balaam  did i not earnestly 
send unto thee to call thee  wherefore 
camest thou not unto me  am i not 
able indeed to promote thee to 
honour  38and balaam said unto 
balak  lo i am come unto thee  have 
i now any power at all to speak any 
thing  the word that god putteth in my 
mouth  that shall i speak  39and 
balaam went with balak  and they 
came unto kiriath huzoth  40and 
balak sacrificed oxen and sheep  and 
sent to balaam  and to the princes that 
were with  him 41and it came to pass 
in the morning that balak took 
balaam  and brought him up into 
bamoth baal and he saw from thence 
the utmost part of the people   
and balaam said unto balak  
build me here seven altars  
and prepare me here seven bullocks 
and seven rams  2and balak did as 
balaam had spoken  and balak and 
balaam offered on every altar a 
bullock and a ram  3and balaam said 
unto balak  stand by thy burnt 
offering  and i will go  peradventure 
the lord will come to meet me  and 
whatsoever he sho weth me i will tell 23 numbers  
227 
 thee and he went to a bare height  
4and god met balaam  and he said 
unto him  i have prepared the seven 
altars  and i have offered up a bullock 
and a ram on every altar  5and the 
lord put a word in balaam s mouth  
and said  return unto balak  and thus 
thou shalt speak  6and he returned 
unto him  and lo he stood by his 
burnt offering  he and all the princes 
of moab  7and he took up his parable  
and said   
from aram balak bringeth me   
the king of moab from the 
mountains of the ea st  
come  curse me jacob   
and come  execrate israel   
8how shall i curse  whom god hath 
not cursed   
and how shall i execrate  whom the 
lord hath not execrated   
9for from the top of the rocks i see 
him  
and from the hills i behold him   
lo it is a p eople that shall dwell 
alone   
and shall not be reckoned among 
the nations   
10who hath counted the dust of 
jacob   
or numbered the stock of israel   
let me die the death of the 
righteous   
and let mine end be like his   
11and balak said unto balaam  what  
hast thou done unto me  i took thee to 
curse mine enemies  and behold  thou 
hast blessed them altogether  12and he 
answered and said  must i not take heed to speak that which the lord 
putteth in my mouth  13and balak 
said unto him  come  i pray thee  
with me unto another place  from 
whence thou mayest see them  thou 
shalt see but the utmost part of them  
and shalt not see them all  and curse 
me them from thence  14and he took 
him into the field of zophim  to the top 
of pisgah  and built seven altars  and 
offered up a bullock and a ram on 
every altar  15and he said unto balak  
stand here by thy burnt offering  
while i go toward a meeting yonder  
16and the lord met balaam  and put a 
word in his mouth  and said  return 
unto balak  and thus shalt thou speak  
17and he came to him  and lo he 
stood by his burnt offering  and the 
princes of moab with him  and balak 
said unto him  what hath the lord 
spoken  18and he took up his parable  
and said   
arise  balak  and hear   
give ear unto me  thou son of 
zippor   
19god is not a man  that he should 
lie  
neither the son of man  that he 
should repent   
when he hath said  will he not do 
it  
or when he hath spoken  will he 
not make it good   
20behold  i am bidden to bless   
and when he hath blessed  i cannot 
call it back   
21none hath beheld iniquity in 
jacob   numbers  
228 
 neither hath one seen perverseness 
in israel   
the lord his god is with him   
and the shouting for the king is 
among them   
22god who brought them forth out 
of egypt  
is for them like the lofty horns of 
the wild ox  
23for there is no enchantment with 
jacob   
neither is there any divination with 
israel   
now is it said of jacob and of israel   
what hath god wrought    
24behold a people that riseth up as a 
lioness   
and as a lion doth he lift himself up   
he shall not lie down until he eat of 
the prey   
and drink the blood of the slain   
25and balak said unto balaam  
neither curse them at all  nor bless 
them at all  26but balaam answered 
and said unto balak  told not i thee  
saying  all that the lord speaketh  that 
i must do  27and balak said unto 
balaam  come now  i will take thee 
unto another place  peradventure it 
will please god that thou mayest curse 
me them from thence  28and balak 
took balaam unto the top of peor  that 
looketh down upon the de sert 29and 
balaam said unto balak  build me 
here seven altars  and prepare me here 
seven bullocks and seven rams  30and 
balak did as balaam had said  and 
offered up a bullock and a ram on 
every altar   and when balaam saw that it 
pleased the lord to bless 
israel  he went not  as at the other 
times  to meet with enchantments  but 
he set his face toward the wilderness  
2and balaam lifted up his eyes  and he 
saw israel dwelling tribe by tribe  and 
the spirit of god came upon him  3and 
he took up his para ble and said   
the saying of balaam the son of 
beor   
and the saying of the man whose 
eye is opened   
4the saying of him who heareth the 
words of god   
who seeth the vision of the 
almighty  fallen down  yet with 
opened eyes   
5how goodly are thy tents  o jacob   
thy dwellings  o israel   
6as valleys stretched out   
as gardens by the river side  
as aloes planted of the lord  
as cedars beside the waters   
7water shall flow from his branches   
and his seed shall be in many 
waters   
and his king shall be hig her than 
agag   
and his kingdom shall be exalted   
8god who brought him forth out of 
egypt  
is for him like the lofty horns of the 
wildox  
he shall eat up the nations that are 
his adversaries   
and shall break their bones in 
pieces   24 numbers  
229 
 and pierce them thro ugh with his 
arrows   
9he couched  he lay down as a lion   
and as a lioness  who shall rouse 
him up   
blessed be every one that blesseth 
thee  
and cursed be every one that 
curseth thee   
10and balak s anger was kindled 
against balaam  and he smote his 
hands together  and balak said unto 
balaam  i called thee to curse mine 
enemies  and behold  thou hast 
altogether blessed them these three 
times  11therefore now flee thou to thy 
place  i thought to promote thee unto 
great honour  but lo the lord hath 
kept thee back from honour  12and 
balaam said unto balak  spoke i not 
also to thy messengers that thou didst 
send unto me  saying  13if balak would 
give me his house full of silver and 
gold i cannot go beyond the word of 
the lord to do either good or bad of 
mine own mind  what the lord 
speaketh  that will i speak  14and now  
behold  i go unto my people  come  
and i will announce to thee what this 
people shall do to thy people in the 
end of days  15and he took up his 
parable  and said   
the saying of balaa m the son of 
beor   
and the saying of the man whose 
eye is opened   
16the saying of him who heareth the 
words of god   and knoweth the knowledge of the 
most high   
who seeth the vision of the 
almighty   
fallen down  yet with opened eyes   
17i see him  but not now   
i behold him  but not nigh   
there shall step forth a star out of 
jacob   
and a scepter shall rise out of israel   
and shall smite through the corners 
of moab   
and break down all the sons of 
seth  
18and edom shall be a possession   
seir also  even his enemies  shall be 
a possession   
while israel doeth valiantly   
19and out of jacob shall one have 
dominion   
and shall destroy the remnant from 
the city   
 
20and he looked on amalek  and 
took up his parable  and said   
amalek was the first of the n ations   
but his end shall come to 
destruction   
 
21and he looked on the kenite  and 
took up his parable  and said   
though firm be thy dwelling place   
and though thy nest be set in the 
rock  
22nevertheless kain shall be wasted   
how long  asshur shall c arry thee 
away captive   
 numbers  
230 
 23and he took up his parable  and 
said  
alas who shall live after god hath 
appointed him   
24but ships shall come from the 
coast of kittim   
and they shall afflict asshur  and 
shall afflict eber   
and he also shall come to 
destr uction   
 
25and balaam rose up  and went and 
returned to his place  and balak also 
went his way   
 
and israel abode in shittim  
and the people began to 
commit harlotry with the daughters of 
moab  2and they called the people 
unto the sacrifices of their gods  and 
the people did eat  and bowed down to 
their gods  3and israel joined himself 
unto the baal of peor  and the anger of 
the lord was kindled against israel  
4and the lord said unto moses  take 
all the chiefs of the people  and hang 
them up unto the  lord in face of the 
sun that the fierce anger of the lord 
may turn away from israel  5and 
moses said unto the judges of israel  
slay ye every one his men that have 
joined themselves unto the baal of 
peor 6and behold  one of the 
children of israel ca me and brought 
unto his brethren a midianitish woman 
in the sight of moses  and in the sight 
of all the congregation of the children 
of israel  while they were weeping at 
the door of the tent of meeting  7and when phinehas  the son of eleazar  the 
son of a aron the priest  saw it  he rose 
up from the midst of the congregation  
and took a spear in his hand  8and he 
went after the man of israel into the 
chamber  and thrust both of them 
through  the man of israel  and the 
woman through her belly  so the 
plague was stayed from the children of 
israel  9and those that died by the 
plague were twenty and four thousand   
  
10and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  11phinehas  the son of eleazar  
the son of aaron the priest  hath turned 
my wrath away from the child ren of 
israel  in that he was very jealous for 
my sake among them  so that i 
consumed not the children of israel in 
my jealousy  12wherefore say  behold  
i give unto him my covenant of peace  
13and it shall be unto him  and to his 
seed after him  the coven ant of an 
everlasting priesthood  because he was 
jealous for his god  and made 
atonement for the children of israel  
14now the name of the man of israel 
that was slain  who was slain with the 
midianitish woman  was zimri  the 
son of salu  a prince of a fa thers house 
among the simeonites  15and the name 
of the midianitish woman that was 
slain was cozbi  the daughter of zur  
he was head of the people of a 
fathers house in midian   
16and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  17harass the midianites  and 
smite t hem 18for they harass you  by 
their wiles wherewith they have 25 numbers  
231 
 beguiled you in the matter of peor  and 
in the matter of cozbi  the daughter of 
the prince of midian  their sister  who 
was slain on the day of the plague in 
the matter of peor   
19and it came  to pass after the  
plague  1that the lord spoke 
unto moses and unto eleazar 
the son of aaron the priest  saying

of the children of israel  from twenty

not a man of them that w ere numbered 
by moses and aaron the priest  who 
numbered the children of israel in the 
wilderness of sinai  65for the lord had numbers  
234 
 said of them  they shall surely die in 
the wilderness  and there was not left 
a man of them  save caleb the son of 
jephunneh  and joshua the son of nun

3our father died in the wilderness  
and he was not among the compa ny of 
them that gathered themselves together 
against the lord in the company of

he had no sons  4why should the name

surely give them a possession of an 
inheritance among their father s 
brethren  and thou shalt cause the 
inheritance of their father to pass unto 
them  8and thou shalt speak unto the 
children of israel  saying  if a man die  
and have no son  then ye shall cause 
his inheritance to pass unto his 
daughter  9and if he have no daughter  then ye shall give his inheritance unto 
his brethren  10and if he have no 
brethren  then ye shall give his 
inheritance unto his father s brethren  
11and if his father have no brethren  
then ye shall give his inheritance unto 
his kinsman that is next to him of  his 
family  and he shall possess it  and it 
shall be unto the children of israel a 
statute of judgment  as the lord 
commanded moses   
12and the lord said unto moses  
get thee up into this mountain of 
abarim  and behold the land which i 
have given unto t he children of israel  
13and when thou hast seen it  thou also 
shalt be gathered unto thy people  as 
aaron thy brother was gathered  
14because ye rebelled against my 
commandment in the wilderness of 
zin in the strife of the congregation  
to sanctify me at  the waters before 
their eyes these are the waters of 
meribath kadesh in the wilderness of 
zin15and moses spoke unto the 
lord saying  16let the lord the god 
of the spirits of all flesh  set a man 
over the congregation  17who may go 
out before them  and who may come in 
before them  and who may lead them 
out and who may bring them in  that 
the congregation of the lord be not as 
sheep which have no shepherd  18and 
the lord said unto moses  take thee 
joshua the son of nun  a man in whom 
is spirit  and lay thy hand upon him  
19and set him before eleazar the priest  
and before all the congregation  and 
give him a charge in their sight  20and 27 numbers  
235 
 thou shalt put of thy honour upon him  
that all the congregation of the 
children of israel may hearken  21and 
he shall stand before eleazar the priest  
who shall inquire for him by the 
judgment of the urim before the lord 
at his word shall they go out  and at his 
word they shall come in  both he  and 
all the children of israel with him  
even all the congregation  22and 
moses did as the lord commanded

and moses told the children 
of israel according to all that 
the lord commanded moses   
 
 
2and moses spoke unto the heads of 
the tribes of the children of is rael 
saying   
this is the thing which the lord 
hath commanded  3when a man 
voweth a vow unto the lord or 
sweareth an oath to bind his soul with 
a bond  he shall not break his word  he 
shall do according to all that 
proceedeth out of his mouth  4also 
when  a woman voweth a vow unto the 
lord and bindeth herself by a bond  
being in her father s house  in her 
youth  5and her father heareth her vow  
or her bond wherewith she hath bound 
her soul  and her father holdeth his 
peace at her  then all her vows shall 
stand  and every bond wherewith she 
hath bound her soul shall stand  6but if 
her father disallow her in the day that 
he heareth  none of her vows  or of her 
bonds wherewith she hath bound her 
soul shall stand  and the lord will 
forgive her  because her fa ther 30 numbers  
239 
 disallowed her  7and if she be married 
to a husband  while her vows are upon 
her or the clear utterance of her lips  
wherewith she hath bound her soul  
8and her husband hear it  whatsoever 
day it be that he heareth it  and hold 
his peace at her  then her vows shall 
stand  and her bonds wherewith she 
hath bound her soul shall stand  9but if 
her husband disallow her in the day 
that he heareth it  then he shall make 
void her vow which is upon her  and 
the clear utterance of her lips  
wherewith she hath b ound her soul  
and the lord will forgive her  10but 
the vow of a widow  or of her that is 
divorced  even every thing wherewith 
she hath bound her soul  shall stand 
against her  11 and if a woman vowed 
in her husband s house  or bound her 
soul by a bond wit h an oath  12and her 
husband heard it  and held his peace at 
her and disallowed her not  then all 
her vows shall stand  and every bond 
wherewith she bound her soul shall 
stand  13but if her husband make them 
null and void in the day that he heareth 
them  then whatsoever proceeded out 
of her lips  whether it were her vows  
or the bond of her soul  shall not stand  
her husband hath made them void  and 
the lord will forgive her  14every 
vow and every binding oath to afflict 
the soul  her husband may let it s tand 
or her husband may make it void  
15but if her husband altogether hold 
his peace at her from day to day  then 
he causeth all her vows to stand  or all 
her bonds  which are upon her  he hath let them stand  because he held his 
peace at her in the day t hat he heard 
them  16but if he shall make them null 
and void after that he hath heard them  
then he shall bear her iniquity  17these 
are the statutes  which the lord 
commanded moses  between a man 
and his wife  between a father and his 
daughter  being in h er youth  in her 
father s house   
and the lord spoke unto 
moses  saying  2avenge the 
children of israel of the midianites  
afterward shalt thou be gathered unto 
thy people  3and moses spoke unto 
the people  saying  arm ye men from 
among you for the w ar that they may 
go against midian  to execute the 
lords vengeance on midian  4of 
every tribe a thousand  throughout all 
the tribes of israel  shall ye send to the 
war 5so there were delivered  out of 
the thousands of israel  a thousand of 
every tribe  twelve thousand armed for 
war 6and moses sent them  a 
thousand of every tribe  to the war  
them and phinehas the son of eleazar 
the priest  to the war  with the holy 
vessels and the trumpets for the alarm 
in his hand  7and they warred against 
midian  as the lord commanded 
moses  and they slew every male  
8and they slew the kings of midian 
with the rest of their slain  evi and 
rekem  and zur  and hur  and reba  
the five kings of midian  balaam also 
the son of beor they slew with the 
sword  9and the childr en of israel took 
captive the women of midian and their 31 numbers  
240 
 little ones  and all their cattle  and all 
their flocks  and all their goods  they 
took for a prey  10and all their cities in 
the places wherein they dwelt  and all 
their encampments  they burnt with 
fire 11and they took all the spoil  and 
all the prey  both of man and of beast  
12and they brought the captives  and 
the prey  and the spoil  unto moses  
and unto eleazar the priest  and unto 
the congregation of the children of 
israel  unto the camp  unto the plains 
of moab  which are by the jordan at 
jericho   
13and moses  and eleazar the priest  
and all the princes of the congregation  
went forth to meet them without the 
camp  14and moses was wroth with 
the officers of the host  the captains of 
thousands  and the captains of 
hundreds  who came from the service 
of the war  15and moses said unto 
them  have ye saved all the women 
alive  16behold  these caused the 
children of israel  through the counsel 
of balaam  to revolt so as to break 
faith with the lord in the matter of 
peor and so the plague was among the 
congregation of the lord 17now 
therefore kill every male among the 
little ones  and kill every woman that 
hath known man by lying with him  
18but all the women children  that have 
not known man by lyi ng with him  
keep alive for yourselves  19and 
encamp ye without the camp seven 
days whosoever hath killed any 
person  and whosoever hath touched 
any slain  purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day  ye 
and your captives  20and as to every 
garment  and all that is made of skin  
and all work of goats hair and all 
things made of wood  ye shall purify   
21and eleazar the priest said unto 
the men of war that went to the battle  
this is the statute of the law which 
the lord hath commanded mose s 
22howbeit the gold  and the silver  the 
brass  the iron  the tin  and the lead  
23every thing that may abide the fire  
ye shall make to go through the fire  
and it shall be clean  nevertheless it 
shall be purified with the water of 
sprinkling  and all t hat abideth not the 
fire ye shall make to go through the 
water  24and ye shall wash your 
clothes on the seventh day  and ye 
shall be clean  and afterward ye may 
come into the camp   
25and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  26take the sum of the prey 
that was taken  both of man and of 
beast  thou and eleazar the priest  and 
the heads of the fathers houses of the 
congregation  27and divide the prey 
into two parts  between the men 
skilled in war  that went out to battle  
and all the congregation  28and levy  a 
tribute unto the lord of the men of 
war that went out to battle  one soul of 
five hundred  both of the persons  and 
of the beeves  and of the asses  and of 
the flocks  29take it of their half  and 
give it unto eleazar the priest  as a 
portion set apart for the lord 30and of 
the children of israel s half  thou shalt 
take one drawn out of every fifty  of numbers  
241 
 the persons  of the beeves  of the asses  
and of the flocks  even of all the cattle  
and give them unto the levites  that 
keep the charge of the tabernac le of 
the lord 31and moses and eleazar 
the priest did as the lord commanded 
moses  32now the prey  over and 
above the booty which the men of war 
took was six hundred thousand and 
seventy thousand and five thousand 
sheep  33and threescore and twelve 
thousand beeves  34and threescore and 
one thousand asses  35and thirty and 
two thousand persons in all  of the 
women that had not known man by 
lying with him  36and the half  which 
was the portion of them that went out 
to war  was in number three hundred 
thous and and thirty thousand and 
seven thousand and five hundred 
sheep  37and the l ords tribute of the 
sheep was six hundred and threescore 
and fifteen  38and the beeves were 
thirty and six thousand  of which the 
lords tribute was threescore and 
twelve  39and the asses were thirty 
thousand and five hundred  of which 
the l ords tribute was threescore and 
one 40and the persons were sixteen 
thousand  of whom the l ords tribute 
was thirty and two persons  41and 
moses gave the tribute  which was set 
apart for the lord unto eleazar the 
priest  as the lord commanded moses  
42and of the children of israel s half  
which moses divided off from the men 
that warred  43now the congregation s 
half was three hundred thousand and 
thirty thousand and seven thousand and five h undred sheep  44and thirty 
and six thousand beeves  45and thirty 
thousand and five hundred asses  46and 
sixteen thousand persons  47even of 
the children of israel s half  moses 
took one drawn out of every fifty  both 
of man and of beast  and gave them 
unto the levites  that kept the charge 
of the tabernacle of the lord as the 
lord commanded moses   
48and the officers that were over the 
thousands of the host  the captains of 
thousands  and the captains of 
hundreds  came near unto moses  
49and they said unto  moses  thy 
servants have taken the sum of the 
men of war that are under our charge  
and there lacketh not one man of us  
50and we have brought the l ords 
offering  what every man hath gotten  
of jewels of gold  armlets  and 
bracelets  signet rings  earrings and 
girdles  to make atonement for our 
souls before the lord 51and moses 
and eleazar the priest took the gold of 
them  even all wrought jewels  52and 
all the gold of the gift that they set 
apart for the lord of the captains of 
thousands  and of th e captains of 
hundreds  was sixteen thousand seven 
hundred and fifty shekels  53for the 
men of war had taken booty  every 
man for himself  54and moses and 
eleazar the priest took the gold of the 
captains of thousands and of hundreds  
and brought it into the tent of meeting  
for a memorial for the children of 
israel before the lord  
 numbers  
242 
 now the children of reuben 
and the children of gad had a 
very great multitude of cattle  and 
when they saw the land of jazer  and 
the land of gilead  that behold  the 
place was a place for cattle  2the 
children of gad and the children of 
reuben came and spoke unto moses  
and to eleazar the priest  and unto the 
princes of the congregation  saying  
3ataroth  and dibon  and jazer  and 
nimrah  and heshbon  and elealeh  
and se bam and nebo  and beon  4the 
land which the lord smote before the 
congregation of israel  is a land for 
cattle  and thy servants have cattle  
5and they said  if we have found 
favour in thy sight  let this land be 
given unto thy servants for a 
possession  bring us not over the 
jordan  6and moses said unto the 
children of gad and to the children of 
reuben  shall your brethren go to the 
war and shall ye sit here  7and 
wherefore will ye turn away the heart 
of the children of israel from going 
over into th e land which the lord hath 
given them  8thus did your fathers  
when i sent them from kadesh barnea 
to see the land  9for when they went 
up unto the valley of eshcol  and saw 
the land  they turned away the heart of 
the children of israel  that they should 
not go into the land which the lord 
had given them  10and the l ords 
anger was kindled in that day  and he 
swore  saying  11surely none of the 
men that came up out of egypt  from 
twenty years old and upward  shall see the land which i swore unto abraham  
unto isaac  and unto jacob  because 
they have not wholly followed me  
12save caleb the son of jephunneh the 
kenizzite  and joshua the son of nun  
because they have wholly followed the 
lord 13and the l ords anger was 
kindled against israel  and he made 
them wander to and fro in the 
wilderness forty years  until all the 
generation  that had done evil in the 
sight of the lord was consumed  
14and behold  ye are risen up in your 
fathers stead  a brood of sinful men  to 
augment yet the fierce anger of the 
lord toward israel  15for if ye turn 
away from after him  he will yet 
again leave them in the wilderness  
and so ye will destroy all this people   
16and they came near unto him  and 
said we will build sheepfolds here 
for our cattle  and cities for our little 
ones 17but we ourselves will be ready 
armed to go before the children of 
israel  until we have brought them 
unto their place  and our little ones 
shall dwell in the fortified cities 
because of the inhabitants of the land  
18we will not return unto our hou ses 
until the children of israel have 
inherited every man his inheritance  
19for we will not inherit with them on 
the other side of the jordan  and 
forward  because our inheritance is 
fallen to us on this side of the jordan 
eastward   
20and moses said un to them  if ye 
will do this thing  if ye will arm 
yourselves to go before the lord to the 32 numbers  
243 
 war 21and every armed man of you 
will pass over the jordan before the 
lord until he hath driven out his 
enemies from before him  22and the 
land be subdued before t he lord and 
ye return afterward  then ye shall be 
clear before the lord and before 
israel  and this land shall be unto you 
for a possession before the lord 23but 
if ye will not do so  behold  ye have 
sinned against the lord and know ye 
your sin which w ill find you  24build 
you cities for your little ones  and 
folds for your sheep  and do that which 
hath proceeded out of your mouth   
25and the children of gad and the 
children of reuben spoke unto moses  
saying  thy servants will do as my 
lord commandet h 26our little ones  
our wives  our flocks  and all our 
cattle  shall be there in the cities of 
gilead  27but thy servants will pass 
over every man that is armed for war  
before the lord to battle  as my lord 
saith   
28so moses gave charge concerning 
them to eleazar the priest  and to 
joshua the son of nun  and to the 
heads of the fathers houses of the 
tribes of the children of israel  29and 
moses said unto them  if the children 
of gad and the children of reuben will 
pass with you over the jordan  every  
man that is armed to battle  before the 
lord and the land shall be subdued 
before you  then ye shall give them the 
land of gilead for a possession  30but if 
they will not pass over with you 
armed  they shall have possessions among you in the land of cana an 
31and the children of gad and the 
children of reuben answered  saying  
as the lord hath said unto thy 
servants  so will we do  32we will pass 
over armed before the lord into the 
land of canaan  and the possession of 
our inheritance shall remain with us 
beyond the jordan   
33and moses gave unto them  even 
to the children of gad  and to the 
children of reuben  and unto the half 
tribe of manasseh the son of joseph  
the kingdom of sihon king of the 
amorites  and the kingdom of og king 
of bashan  the land  according to the 
cities thereof with their borders  even 
the cities of the land round about  
34and the children of gad built dibon  
and ataroth  and aroer  35and atroth 
shophan  and jazer  and jogbehah  
36and beth nimrah  and beth haran  
fortified cities  and folds for sheep  
37and the children of reuben built 
heshbon  and elealeh  and kiriathaim  
38and nebo  and baal meon their 
names being changed and sibmah  
and gave their names unto the cities 
which they builded  39and the children 
of machir the son of  manasseh went to 
gilead  and took it  and dispossessed 
the amorites that were therein  40and 
moses gave gilead unto machir the 
son of manasseh  and he dwelt therein  
41and jair the son of manasseh went

9and the lord spoke unto moses  
saying  10speak unto the children of 
israel  and say unto them  when ye 
pass over the jordan into the land of 
canaan  11then ye shall appoint you 
cities to be cities of refuge for you  
that the manslayer that killeth any 
person through error may flee thither  
12and the cities shall be unto you for 
refuge from the avenger  that the 
manslayer die not  until he stand 
before the congregation for judgment  
13and as to the cities which ye shall 
give there shall be for you six cities of 
refuge  14ye shall give three cities 
beyond the jordan  and three citi es 
shall ye give in the land of canaan  
they shall be cities of refuge  15for the 
children of israel  and for the stranger 35 numbers  
248 
 and for the settler among them  shall 
these six cities be for refuge  that 
every one that killeth any person 
through error may flee t hither  16but if 
he smote him with an instrument of 
iron so that he died  he is a murderer  
the murderer shall surely be put to 
death  17and if he smote him with a 
stone in the hand  whereby a man may 
die and he died  he is a murderer  the 
murderer shall  surely be put to death  
18or if he smote him with a weapon of 
wood in the hand  whereby a man may 
die and he died  he is a murderer  the 
murderer shall surely be put to death  
19the avenger of blood shall himself 
put the murderer to death  when he 
meetet h him  he shall put him to death  
20and if he thrust him of hatred  or 
hurled at him any thing  lying in wait  
so that he died  21or in enmity smote 
him with his hand  that he died  he that 
smote him shall surely be put to death  
he is a murderer  the aven ger of blood 
shall put the murderer to death when 
he meeteth him  22but if he thrust him 
suddenly without enmity  or hurled 
upon him any thing without lying in 
wait 23or with any stone  whereby a 
man may die  seeing him not  and cast 
it upon him  so that he died  and he

ordinances  25and the congregation 
shall deliver the manslayer out of the

refuge until the death of the high 
priest  but after the death of the high 
priest the manslayer may return into 
the land of his possession  29and these 
things shall be for a statute of 
judgment unto you throughout your 
generations in all your dwellings

murderer shall be slain at the mouth of 
witnesses  but one witness shall not 
testify against any person that he die  
31moreover ye shall take no ransom for 
the life of a murderer  that is guilty of 
death  but he shall surely be put to 
death 32and ye shall take no ransom 
for him that is fled to his city of 
refuge  that he should come again to 
dwell in the land  until the death of the 
priest  33so ye shall not pollute the 
land wherein ye are  for blood  it 
polluteth the land  and no expiatio n 
can be made for the land for the blood 
that is shed therein  but by the blood of 
him that shed it  34and thou shalt not 
defile the land which ye inhabit  in the 
midst of which i dwell  for i the lord numbers  
249 
 dwell in the midst of the children of 
israel   
 
and the heads of the 
fathers houses of the family of 
the children of gilead  the son of 
machir  the son of manasseh  of the 
families of the sons of joseph  came 
near and spoke before moses  and 
before the princes  the heads of the 
fathers houses of the chil dren of israel  
2and they said  the lord commanded 
my lord to give the land for inheritance 
by lot to the children of israel  and my 
lord was commanded by the lord to 
give the inheritance of zelophehad our 
brother unto his daughters  3and if 
they be marri ed to any of the sons of 
the other tribes of the children of 
israel  then will their inheritance be 
taken away from the inheritance of our 
fathers  and will be added to the 
inheritance of the tribe whereunto they 
shall belong  so will it be taken away 
from  the lot of our inheritance  4and 
when the jubilee of the children of 
israel shall be  then will their 
inheritance be added unto the 
inheritance of the tribe whereunto they 
shall belong  so will their inheritance 
be taken away from the inheritance of 
the t ribe of our fathers  5and moses 
commanded the children of israel 
according to the word of the lord 
saying  the tribe of the sons of 
joseph speaketh right  6this is the thing which the lord hath commanded 
concerning the daughters of 
zelophehad  saying  let them be 
married to whom they think best  only 
into the family of the tribe of their 
father shall they be married  7so shall 
no inheritance of the children of israel 
remove from tribe to tribe  for the 
children of israel shall cleave every 
one to the inh eritance of the tribe of 
his fathers  8and every daughter  that 
possesseth an inheritance in any tribe 
of the children of israel  shall be wife 
unto one of the family of the tribe of 
her father  that the children of israel 
may possess every man the inherit ance 
of his fathers  9so shall no inheritance 
remove from one tribe to another tribe  
for the tribes of the children of israel 
shall cleave each one to its own 
inheritance  10even as the lord 
commanded moses  so did the 
daughters of zelophehad  11for 
mahl ah tirzah  and hoglah  and 
milcah  and noah  the daughters of 
zelophehad  were married unto their 
father s brothers sons 12they were 
married into the families of the sons of 
manasseh the son of joseph  and their 
inheritance remained in the tribe of the 
family of their father   
13these are the commandments and 
the ordinances  which the lord 
commanded by the hand of moses 
unto the children of israel in the plains 
of moab by the jordan at jericho

deuteronomy  
 
these are the words which moses 
spoke unto all israel beyond the 
jordan  in the wilderness  in the 
arabah  over against suph  between 
paran and tophel  and laban  and 
hazeroth  and di zahab  2it is eleven 
days journey from horeb unto kadesh 
barnea by the way of mount seir  3and 
it came to pass in the fortieth year  in 
the eleventh month  on the first day of 
the month  that moses spoke unto the 
children of israel  according unto all 
that the lord had given him in 
commandment unto them  4after he 
had smitten sihon the king of the 
amorites  who dwelt in heshbon  and 
og the king of bashan  who dwelt in 
ashtaroth  at edrei  5beyond the 
jordan  in the land of moab  took 
moses upon him to expound this law  
saying  6the lord our god spoke unto 
us in horeb  saying  ye have dwelt 
long enough in this mountain  7turn 
you and take your journey  and go to 
the hill country of the amorites and 
unto all the places nigh thereunto  in 
the arabah  in the hill country  and in 
the lowland  and in the south  and by 
the sea shore  the land of the 
canaanites  and lebanon  as far as the 
great river  the river euphrates  
8behold  i have set the land before 
you go in and possess the land which 
the lord swore unto your fathers  to abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  to 
give unto them and to their seed after 
them   
9and i spoke unto you at that time  
saying  i am not able to bear you 
myself alone  10the lord your god 
hath multiplied you  and behold  ye 
are this day as the stars of heaven for 
multitude 11the lord the god of 
your fathers  make you a thousand 
times so many more as ye are  and 
bless you  as he hath promised you 
12how can i myself alone bear your 
cumbrance  and your burden  and your 
strife  13get you  from each one of 
your tribes  wise men  and 
underst anding  and full of knowledge  
and i will make them heads over you  
14and ye answered me  and said  the 
thing which thou hast spoken is good 
for us to do  15so i took the heads of 
your tribes  wise men  and full of 
knowledge  and made them heads over 
you captains of thousands  and 
captains of hundreds  and captains of 
fifties  and captains of tens  and 
officers  tribe by tribe  16and i charged 
your judges at that time  saying  hear 
the causes between your brethren  and 
judge righteously between a man a nd 
his brother  and the stranger that is 
with him  17ye shall not respect 
persons in judgment  ye shall hear the 
small and the great alike  ye shall not 1 deuteronomy  
251 
 be afraid of the face of any man  for 
the judgment is god s and the cause 
that is too hard for you ye shall bring 
unto me  and i will hear it  18and i 
commanded you at that time all the 
things which ye should do   
19and we journeyed from horeb  
and went through all that great and 
dreadful wilderness which ye saw  by 
the way to the hill country of the 
amor ites as the lord our god 
commanded us  and we came to 
kadesh barnea  20and i said unto you  
ye are come unto the hill country of 
the amorites  which the lord our god 
giveth unto us  21behold  the lord thy 
god hath set the land before thee  go 
up take po ssession  as the lord the 
god of thy fathers  hath spoken unto 
thee fear not  neither be dismayed  
22and ye came near unto me every one 
of you  and said  let us send men 
before us  that they may search the 
land for us  and bring us back word of 
the way  by which we must go up  and 
the cities unto which we shall come  
23and the thing pleased me well  and i 
took twelve men of you  one man for 
every tribe  24and they turned and went 
up into the mountains  and came unto 
the valley of eshcol  and spied it ou t 
25and they took of the fruit of the land 
in their hands  and brought it down 
unto us  and brought us back word  
and said  good is the land which the 
lord our god giveth unto us  26yet ye 
would not go up  but rebelled against 
the commandment of the lord your 
god 27and ye murmured in your tents  and said  because the lord hated us  
he hath brought us forth out of the 
land of egypt  to deliver us into the 
hand of the amorites  to destroy us  
28whither are we going up  our 
brethren have made our heart to  melt 
saying  the people is greater and taller 
than we  the cities are great and 
fortified up to heaven  and moreover 
we have seen the sons of the anakim 
there  29then i said unto you  dread 
not neither be afraid of them  30the 
lord your god who goeth before you  
he shall fight for you  according to all 
that he did for you in egypt before 
your eyes  31and in the wilderness  
where thou hast seen how that the 
lord thy god bore thee  as a man doth 
bear his son  in all the way that ye 
went  until ye came un to this place  
32yet in this thing ye do not believe the 
lord your god  33who went before 
you in the way  to seek you out a place 
to pitch your tents in  in fire by night  
to show you by what way ye should 
go and in the cloud by day   
34and the lord heard the voice of 
your words  and was wroth  and swore  
saying  35surely there shall not one of 
these men  even this evil generation  
see the good land  which i swore to 
give unto your fathers  36save caleb 
the son of jephunneh  he shall see it  
and to him w ill i give the land that he 
hath trodden upon  and to his children  
because he hath wholly followed the 
lord 37also the lord was angry with 
me for your sakes  saying  thou also 
shalt not go in thither  38joshua the son deuteronomy  
252 
 of nun  who standeth before thee  he 
shall go in thither  encourage thou 
him for he shall cause israel to inherit 
it 39moreover your little ones  that ye 
said should be a prey  and your 
children  that this day have no 
knowledge of good or evil  they shall 
go in thither  and unto them will  i give 
it and they shall possess it  40but as 
for you  turn you  and take your 
journey into the wilderness by the way 
to the red sea  41then ye answered 
and said unto me  we have sinned 
against the lord we will go up and 
fight  according to all that t he lord our 
god commanded us  and ye girded 
on every man his weapons of war  and 
deemed it a light thing to go up into 
the hill country  42and the lord said 
unto me  say unto them  go not up  
neither fight  for i am not among you  
lest ye be smitten befo re your 
enemies  43so i spoke unto you  and 
ye hearkened not  but ye rebelled 
against the commandment of the lord 
and were presumptuous  and went up 
into the hill country  44and the 
amorites  that dwell in that hill 
country  came out against you  and 
chased you  as bees do  and beat you 
down in seir  even unto hormah  
45and ye returned and wept before the 
lord but the lord hearkened not to 
your voice  nor gave ear unto you  46so 
ye abode in kadesh many days  
according unto the days that ye abode 
there   
then we turned  and took our 
journey into the wilderness by the way to the red sea  as the lord spoke 
unto me  and we compassed mount 
seir many days   
2and the lord spoke unto me  
saying  3ye have compassed this 
mountain long enough  turn you 
northward  4and command thou the 
people  saying  ye are to pass through 
the border of your brethren the 
children of esau  that dwell in seir  
and they will be afraid of you  take ye 
good heed unto yourselves therefore  
5contend not with them  for i will not 
give you  of their land  no not so much 
as for the sole of the foot to tread on  
because i have given mount seir unto 
esau for a possession  6ye shall 
purchase food of them for money  that 
ye may eat  and ye shall also buy 
water of them for money  that ye may 
drink 7for the lord thy god hath 
blessed thee in all the work of thy 
hand  he hath known thy walking 
through this great wilderness  these 
forty years the lord thy god hath been 
with thee  thou hast lacked nothing  
8so we passed by from our brethren 
the child ren of esau  that dwell in seir  
from the way of the arabah  from 
elath and from ezion geber   
and we turned and passed by the 
way of the wilderness of moab  9and 
the lord said unto me  be not at 
enmity with moab  neither contend 
with them in battle  for i will not give 
thee of his land for a possession  
because i have given ar unto the 
children of lot for a possession 
10the emim dwelt therein aforetime  a 2 deuteronomy  
253 
 people great  and many  and tall  as the 
anakim  11these also are accounted 
rephaim  as the anakim  but the 
moabites call them emim  12and in 
seir dwelt the horites aforetime  but 
the children of esau succeeded them  
and they destroyed them from before 
them  and dwelt in their stead  as israel 
did unto the land of his possession  
which the lord gave unto  them 
13now rise up  and get you over the 
brook zered  and we went over the 
brook zered  14and the days in which 
we came from kadesh barnea  until 
we were come over the brook zered  
were thirty and eight years  until all 
the generation  even the men of w ar 
were consumed from the midst of the 
camp  as the lord swore unto them  
15moreover the hand of the lord was 
against them  to discomfit them from 
the midst of the camp  until they were 
consumed   
16so it came to pass  when all the 
men of war were consume d and dead 
from among the people  17that the lord 
spoke unto me saying  18thou art this 
day to pass over the border of moab  
even ar  19and when thou comest nigh 
over against the children of ammon  
harass them not  nor contend with 
them  for i will not gi ve thee of the 
land of the children of ammon for a 
possession  because i have given it 
unto the children of lot for a 
possession  20that also is accounted 
a land of rephaim  rephaim dwelt 
therein aforetime  but the ammonites 
call them zamzummim  21a peopl e great  and many  and tall  as the 
anakim  but the lord destroyed them 
before them  and they succeeded them  
and dwelt in their stead  22as he did for 
the children of esau  that dwell in seir  
when he destroyed the horites from 
before them  and they succe eded them  
and dwelt in their stead even unto this 
day 23and the avvim  that dwelt in 
villages as far as gaza  the caphtorim  
that came forth out of caphtor  
destroyed them  and dwelt in their 
stead  24rise ye up  take your 
journey  and pass over the val ley of 
arnon  behold  i have given into thy 
hand sihon the amorite  king of 
heshbon  and his land  begin to 
possess it  and contend with him in 
battle  25this day will i begin to put 
the dread of thee and the fear of thee 
upon the peoples that are under th e 
whole heaven  who when they hear 
the report of thee  shall tremble  and be 
in anguish because of thee   
26and i sent messengers out of the 
wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon 
king of heshbon with words of peace  
saying  27let me pass through thy 
land i will go along by the highway  i 
will neither turn unto the right hand 
nor to the left  28thou shalt sell me 
food for money  that i may eat  and 
give me water for money  that i may 
drink  only let me pass through on my 
feet 29as the children of esau that 
dwell in seir  and the moabites that 
dwell in ar  did unto me  until i shall 
pass over the jordan into the land 
which the lord our god giveth us  deuteronomy  
254 
 30but sihon king of heshbon would 
not let us pass by him  for the lord thy 
god hardened his spirit  and made his 
heart obstinate  that he might deliver 
him into thy hand  as appeareth this 
day  
31and the lord said unto me  
behold  i have begun to deliver up 
sihon and his land before thee  begin 
to possess his land  32then sihon 
came out against us  he and all his 
people  unto battle at jahaz  33and the 
lord our god delivered him up before 
us and we smote him  and his sons  
and all his people  34and we took all 
his cities at that time  and utterly 
destroyed every city  the men  and the 
women  and the little one s we left 
none remaining  35only the cattle we 
took for a prey unto ourselves  with 
the spoil of the cities which we had 
taken  36from aroer  which is on the 
edge of the valley of arnon  and from 
the city that is in the valley  even unto 
gilead  there was  not a city too high 
for us  the lord our god delivered up 
all before us  37only to the land of the 
children of ammon thou camest not 
near all the side of the river jabbok  
and the cities of the hill country  and 
wheresoever the lord our god forbade 
us  
 
then we turned  and went up the 
way to bashan  and og the king 
of bashan came out against us  he and 
all his people  unto battle at edrei  
2and the lord said unto me  fear him 
not for i have delivered him  and all his people  and his land  into thy ha nd 
and thou shalt do unto him as thou 
didst unto sihon king of the amorites  
who dwelt at heshbon  3so the lord 
our god delivered into our hand og 
also the king of bashan  and all his 
people  and we smote him until none 
was left to him remaining  4and w e 
took all his cities at that time  there 
was not a city which we took not from 
them  threescore cities  all the region 
of argob  the kingdom of og in 
bashan  5all these were fortified cities  
with high walls  gates  and bars  beside 
the unwalled towns a g reat many  
6and we utterly destroyed them  as we 
did unto sihon king of heshbon  
utterly destroying every city  the men  
and the women  and the little ones  
7but all the cattle  and the spoil of the 
cities  we took for a prey unto 
ourselves   
8and we took the land at that time 
out of the hand of the two kings of the 
amorites that were beyond the jordan  
from the valley of arnon unto mount 
hermon  9which hermon the 
sidonians call sirion  and the 
amorites call it senir 10all the cities 
of the plain  and all g ilead  and all 
bashan  unto salcah and edrei  cities 
of the kingdom of og in bashan 
11for only og king of bashan 
remained of the remnant of the 
rephaim  behold  his bedstead was a 
bedstead of iron  is it not in rabbah of 
the children of ammon  nine cubits  
was the length thereof  and four cubits 
the breadth of it  after the cubit of a 3 deuteronomy  
255 
 man12and this land we took in 
possession at that time  from aroer  
which is by the valley of arnon  and 
half the hill country of gilead  and the 
cities thereof  gave i unto the 
reubenites and to the gadites  13and 
the rest of gilead  and all bashan  the 
kingdom of og  gave i unto the half 
tribe of manasseh  all the region of 
argob all that bashan is called the 
land of rephaim  14jair the son of 
manasseh took all the region of  argob  
unto the border of the geshurites and 
the maacathites  and called them  even 
bashan  after his own name  havvoth 
jair unto this day 15and i gave 
gilead unto machir  16and unto the 
reubenites and unto the gadites i gave 
from gilead even unto the v alley of 
arnon  the middle of the valley for a 
border  even unto the river jabbok  
which is the border of the children of 
ammon  17the arabah also  the jordan 
being the border thereof  from 
chinnereth even unto the sea of the 
arabah  the salt sea  under th e slopes 
of pisgah eastward   
18and i commanded you at that 
time saying  the lord your god hath 
given you this land to possess it  ye 
shall pass over armed before your 
brethren the children of israel  all the 
men of valour  19but your wives  and 
your lit tle ones  and your cattle i 
know that ye have much cattle shall 
abide in your cities which i have given 
you 20until the lord give rest unto 
your brethren  as unto you  and they 
also possess the land which the lord your god giveth them beyond the 
jordan  then shall ye return every man 
unto his possession  which i have 
given you  21and i commanded joshua 
at that time  saying  thine eyes have 
seen all that the lord your god hath 
done unto these two kings  so shall the 
lord do unto all the kingdoms whither 
thou goest over  22ye shall not fear 
them  for the lord your god  he it is 
that fighteth for you   
 
  
23and i besought the lord at that 
time saying  24o lord g od thou hast 
begun to show thy servant thy 
greatness  and thy strong hand  for 
what god is there in heaven or on 
earth  that can do according to thy 
works  and according to thy mighty 
acts 25let me go over  i pray thee  
and see the good land that is beyond 
the jordan  that goodly hill country  
and lebanon  26but the lord was 
wroth with me for your sakes  and 
hearkened not unto me  and the lord 
said unto me  let it suffice thee  
speak no m ore unto me of this matter  
27get thee up into the top of pisgah  
and lift up thine eyes westward  and 
northward  and southward  and 
eastward  and behold with thine eyes  
for thou shalt not go over this jordan  
28but charge joshua  and encourage 
him and s trengthen him  for he shall 
go over before this people  and he 
shall cause them to inherit the land 
which thou shalt see  29so we abode 
in the valley over against beth peor  deuteronomy  
256 
 and now  o israel  hearken unto 
the statutes and unto the 
ordinances  which i teach you  to do 
them  that ye may live  and go in and 
possess the land which the lord the 
god of your fathers  giveth you  2ye 
shall not add unto the word which i 
command you  neither shall ye 
diminish from it  that ye may keep the 
commandments of the lord your god 
which i command you  3your eyes 
have seen what the lord did in baal 
peor for all the men that followed the 
baal of peor  the lord thy god hath 
destroyed them from the midst of thee  
4but ye that did cleave unto the lord 
your god are alive ever y one of you 
this day  5behold  i have taught you 
statutes and ordinances  even as the 
lord my god commanded me  that ye 
should do so in the midst of the land 
whither ye go in to possess it  
6observe therefore and do them  for 
this is your wisdom and your 
understanding in the sight of the 
peoples  that when they hear all these 
statutes  shall say  surely this great 
nation is a wise and understanding 
people  7for what great nation is 
there  that hath god so nigh unto them  
as the lord our god is whensoeve r we 
call upon him  8and what great nation 
is there  that hath statutes and 
ordinances so righteous as all this law  
which i set before you this day  9only 
take heed to thyself  and keep thy soul 
diligently  lest thou forget the things 
which thine eyes saw  and lest they 
depart from thy heart all the days of thy life  but make them known unto 
thy children and thy children s 
children  10the day that thou stoodest 
before the lord thy god in horeb  
when the lord said unto me  
assemble me the people  and i wil l 
make them hear my words that they 
may learn to fear me all the days that 
they live upon the earth  and that they 
may teach their children  11and ye 
came near and stood under the 
mountain  and the mountain burned 
with fire unto the heart of heaven  with 
darkness  cloud  and thick darkness  
12and the lord spoke unto you out of 
the midst of the fire  ye heard the 
voice of words  but ye saw no form  
only a voice  13and he declared unto 
you his covenant  which he 
commanded you to perform  even the 
ten words  and he wrote them upon 
two tables of stone  14and the lord 
commanded me at that time to teach 
you statutes and ordinances  that ye 
might do them in the land whither ye 
go over to possess it  15take ye 
therefore good heed unto yourselves 
for ye saw no manne r of form on the 
day that the lord spoke unto you in 
horeb out of the midst of the fire 
16lest ye deal corruptly  and make you 
a graven image  even the form of any 
figure  the likeness of male or female  
17the likeness of any beast that is on 
the earth  the likeness of any winged 
fowl that flieth in the heaven  18the 
likeness of any thing that creepeth on 
the ground  the likeness of any fish 
that is in the water under the earth  4 deuteronomy  
257 
 19and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto 
heaven  and when thou seest the sun 
and the moon and the stars  even all 
the host of heaven  thou be drawn 
away and worship them  and serve 
them  which the lord thy god hath 
allotted unto all the peoples under the 
whole heaven  20but you hath the lord 
taken and brought forth out of the iron 
furnace out of egypt  to be unto him 
a people of inheritance  as ye are this 
day 21now the lord was angered with 
me for your sakes  and swore that i 
should not go over the jordan  and that 
i should not go in unto that good land  
which the lord thy god givet h thee 
for an inheritance  22but i must die in 
this land  i must not go over the 
jordan  but ye are to go over  and 
possess that good land  23take heed 
unto yourselves  lest ye forget the 
covenant of the lord your god  which 
he made with you  and make you a 
graven image  even the likeness of any 
thing which the lord thy god hath 
forbidden thee  24for the lord thy god 
is a devouring fire  a jealous god   
25when thou shalt beget children  
and children s children  and ye shall 
have been long in the land  and s hall 
deal corruptly  and make a graven 
image  even the form of any thing  and 
shall do that which is evil in the sight 
of the lord thy god  to provoke him  
26i call heaven and earth to witness 
against you this day  that ye shall soon 
utterly perish from of f the land 
whereunto ye go over the jordan to 
possess it  ye shall not prolong your days upon it  but shall utterly be 
destroyed  27and the lord shall scatter 
you among the peoples  and ye shall 
be left few in number among the 
nations  whither the lord shall lead 
you away  28and there ye shall serve 
gods  the work of men s hands  wood 
and stone  which neither see  nor hear  
nor eat  nor smell  29but from thence 
ye will seek the lord thy god  and 
thou shalt find him  if thou search 
after him with all thy hea rt and with 
all thy soul  30in thy distress  when all 
these things are come upon thee  in the 
end of days  thou wilt return to the 
lord thy god  and hearken unto his 
voice  31for the lord thy god is a 
merciful god  he will not fail thee  
neither destroy th ee nor forget the 
covenant of thy fathers which he 
swore unto them  32for ask now of the 
days past  which were before thee  
since the day that god created man 
upon the earth  and from the one end 
of heaven unto the other  whether there 
hath been any such thing as this great 
thing is  or hath been heard like it  
33did ever a people hear the voice of 
god speaking out of the midst of the 
fire as thou hast heard  and live  34or 
hath god assayed to go and take him a 
nation from the midst of another 
nation  by trials  by signs  and by 
wonders  and by war  and by a mighty 
hand  and by an outstretched arm  and 
by great terrors  according to all that 
the lord your god did for you in 
egypt before thine eyes  35unto thee it 
was shown  that thou mightiest know deuteronomy  
258 
 that th e lord he is god  there is none 
else beside him  36out of heaven he 
made thee to hear his voice  that he 
might instruct thee  and upon earth he 
made thee to see his great fire  and 
thou didst hear his words out of the 
midst of the fire  37and because he 
loved thy fathers  and chose their seed 
after them  and brought thee out with 
his presence  with his great power  
out of egypt  38to drive out nations 
from before thee greater and mightier 
than thou  to bring thee in  to give thee 
their land for an inherita nce as it is 
this day  39know this day  and lay it to 
thy heart  that the lord he is god in 
heaven above and upon the earth 
beneath  there is none else  40and thou 
shalt keep his statutes  and his 
commandments  which i command 
thee this day  that it may go well with 
thee and with thy children after thee  
and that thou mayest prolong thy days 
upon the land  which the lord thy god 
giveth thee  for ever   
 
41then moses separated three cities 
beyond the jordan toward the 
sunrising  42that the manslayer might  
flee thither  that slayeth his neighbour 
unawares  and hated him not in time 
past and that fleeing unto one of these 
cities he might live  43bezer in the 
wilderness  in the table land for the 
reubenites  and ramoth in gilead  for 
the gadites  and golan in bashan  for 
the manassites   
 44and this is the law which moses 
set before the children of israel  45these 
are the testimonies  and the statutes  
and the ordinances  which moses 
spoke unto the children of israel  when 
they came forth out of egypt  46beyond 
the jordan  in the valley over against 
beth peor in the land of sihon king of 
the amorites  who dwelt at heshbon  
whom moses and the children of israel 
smote  when they came forth out of 
egypt  47and they took his land in 
possession  and the land of o g king of 
bashan  the two kings of the amorites  
who were beyond the jordan toward 
the sunrising  48from aroer  which is 
on the edge of the valley of arnon  
even unto mount sion the same is 
hermon  49and all the arabah beyond 
the jordan eastward  even unto  the sea 
of the arabah  under the slopes of 
pisgah   
and moses called unto all israel  
and said unto them   
hear  o israel  the statutes and the 
ordinances which i speak in your ears 
this day  that ye may learn them  and 
observe to do them  2the lord our 
god made a covenant with us in 
horeb  3the lord made not this 
covenant with our fathers  but with us  
even us  who are all of us here alive 
this day  4the lord spoke with you 
face to face in the mount out of the 
midst of the fire  5i stood between the 
lord and you at that time  to declare 
unto you the word of the lord for ye 
were afraid because of the fire  and 
went not up into the mount saying   5 deuteronomy  
259 
 6i am the lord thy god  who 
brought thee out of the land of egypt  
out of the house of bondage   
7thou shalt h ave no other gods 
before me  8thou shalt not make unto 
thee a graven image  even any manner 
of likeness  of any thing that is in 
heaven above  or that is in the earth 
beneath  or that is in the water under 
the earth  9thou shalt not bow down 
unto them  nor serve them  for i the 
lord thy god am a jealous god  
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon 
the children  and upon the third and 
upon the fourth generation of them 
that hate me  10and showing mercy 
unto the thousandth generation of them 
that love me an d keep my 
commandments   
11thou shalt not take the name of 
the lord thy god in vain  for the lord 
will not hold him guiltless that taketh 
his name in vain   
12observe the sabbath day  to keep it 
holy as the lord thy god commanded 
thee 13six days shalt th ou labour  and 
do all thy work  14but the seventh day 
is a sabbath unto the lord thy god  in 
it thou shalt not do any manner of 
work  thou nor thy son  nor thy 
daughter  nor thy man servant  nor thy 
maid servant  nor thine ox  nor thine 
ass nor any of th y cattle  nor thy 
stranger that is within thy gates  that 
thy man servant and thy maid servant 
may rest as well as thou  15and thou 
shalt remember that thou was a servant 
in the land of egypt  and the lord thy 
god brought thee out thence by a mighty hand a nd by an outstretched 
arm therefore the lord thy god 
commanded thee to keep the sabbath 
day  
16honour thy father and thy mother  
as the lord thy god commanded thee  
that thy days may be long  and that it 
may go well with thee  upon the land 
which the lord thy god giveth thee   
17thou shalt not murder   
neither shalt thou commit adultery   
neither shalt thou steal   
neither shalt thou bear false witness 
against thy neighbour   
18neither shalt thou covet thy 
neighbour s wife  neither shalt thou 
desire thy n eighbour s house  his field  
or his man servant  or his maid 
servant  his ox  or his ass  or any thing 
that is thy neighbour s  
19these words the lord spoke unto 
all your assembly in the mount out of 
the midst of the fire  of the cloud  and 
of the thick d arkness  with a great 
voice  and it went on no more  and he 
wrote them upon two tables of stone  
and gave them unto me  20and it came 
to pass  when ye heard the voice out of 
the midst of the darkness  while the 
mountain did burn with fire  that ye 
came nea r unto me  even all the heads 
of your tribes  and your elders  21and 
ye said  behold  the lord our god 
hath shown us his glory and his 
greatness  and we have heard his 
voice out of the midst of the fire  we 
have seen this day that god doth speak 
with man  and he liveth  22now 
therefore why should we die  for this deuteronomy  
260 
 great fire will consume us  if we hear 
the voice of the lord our god any 
more  then we shall die  23for who is 
there of all flesh  that hath heard the 
voice of the living god speaking out of 
the m idst of the fire  as we have  and 
lived  24go thou near  and hear all that 
the lord our god may say  and thou 
shalt speak unto us all that the lord 
our god may speak unto thee  and we 
will hear it and do it  25and the lord 
heard the voice of your words  when 
ye spoke unto me  and the lord said 
unto me  i have heard the voice of the 
words of this people  which they have 
spoken unto thee  they have well said 
all that they have spoken  26oh that 
they had such a heart as this alway  to 
fear me  and keep all m y 
commandments  that it might be well 
with them  and with their children for 
ever 27go say to them  return ye to 
your tents  28but as for thee  stand thou 
here by me  and i will speak unto thee 
all the commandment  and the statutes  
and the ordinances  which thou shalt 
teach them  that they may do them in 
the land which i give them to possess 
it 29ye shall observe to do therefore 
as the lord your god hath 
commanded you  ye shall not turn 
aside to the right hand or to the left  
30ye shall walk in all the way which 
the lord your god hath commanded 
you that ye may live  and that it may 
be well with you  and that ye may 
prolong your days in the land which ye 
shall possess   now this is the commandment  
the statutes  and the ordinances  
which the lord your god commanded 
to teach you  that ye might do them in 
the land whither ye go over to possess 
it 2that thou mightest fear the lord 
thy god  to keep all his statutes and 
his commandments  which i command 
thee thou and thy son  and thy son s 
son all the da ys of thy life  and that 
thy days may be prolonged  3hear 
therefore  o israel  and observe to do 
it that it may be well with thee  and 
that ye may increase mightily  as the 
lord the god of thy fathers  hath 
promised unto thee a land flowing 
with milk and  honey   
4hear  o israel  the lord  our g od 
the lord  is one  5and thou shalt love 
the lord thy god with all thy heart  
and with all thy soul  and with all thy 
might  6and these words  which i 
command thee this day  shall be upon 
thy heart  7and thou shalt teach them 
diligently unto thy children  and shalt 
talk of them when thou sittest in thy 
house  and when thou walkest by the 
way and when thou liest down  and 
when thou risest up  8and thou shalt 
bind them for a sign upon thy hand  
and they shall be for f rontlets between 
thine eyes  9and thou shalt write them 
upon the door posts of thy house  and 
upon thy gates   
10and it shall be  when the lord thy 
god shall bring thee into the land 
which he swore unto thy fathers  to 
abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  to 
give thee great and goodly cities  6 deuteronomy  
261 
 which thou didst not build  11and 
houses full of all good things  which 
thou didst not fill  and cisterns hewn 
out which thou the didst not hew  
vineyards and olive trees  which thou 
didst not plant  and thou shalt eat an d 
be satisfied 12then beware lest thou 
forget the lord who brought thee 
forth out of the land of egypt  out of 
the house of bondage  13thou shalt 
fear the lord thy god  and him shalt 
thou serve  and by his name shalt thou 
swear  14ye shall not go after ot her 
gods  of the gods of the peoples that 
are round about you  15for a jealous 
god even the lord thy god  is in the 
midst of thee  lest the anger of the 
lord thy god be kindled against thee  
and he destroy thee from off the face 
of the earth   
16ye shall not try the lord your 
god as ye tried him in massah  17ye 
shall diligently keep the 
commandments of the lord your god  
and his testimonies  and his statutes  
which he hath commanded thee  
18and thou shalt do that which is right 
and good in the sight of th e lord that 
it may be well with thee  and that thou 
mayest go in and possess the good 
land which the lord swore unto thy 
fathers  19to thrust out all thine 
enemies from before thee  as the lord 
hath spoken   
20when thy son asketh thee in time 
to come  saying what mean the 
testimonies  and the statutes  and the 
ordinances  which the lord our god 
hath commanded you  21then thou shalt say unto thy son  we were 
pharaoh s bondmen in egypt  and the 
lord brought us out of egypt with a 
mighty hand  22and the lord showed 
signs and wonders  great and sore  
upon egypt  upon pharaoh  and upon 
all his house  before our eyes  23and 
he brought us out from thence  that he 
might bring us in  to give us the land 
which he swore unto our fathers  
24and the lord commanded us  to do 
all these statutes  to fear the lord our 
god for our good always  that he 
might preserve us alive  as it is at this 
day 25and it shall be righteousness 
unto us  if we observe to do all this 
commandment before the lord our 
god as he hath commanded  us  
when the lord thy god shall 
bring thee into the land whither 
thou goest to possess it  and shall cast 
out many nations before thee  the 
hittite  and the girgashite  and the 
amorite  and the canaanite  and the 
perizzite  and the hivite  and the 
jebusite  seven nations greater and 
mightier than thou  2and when the 
lord thy god shall deliver them up 
before thee  and thou shalt smite them  
then thou shalt utterly destroy them  
thou shalt make no covenant with 
them  nor show mercy unto them  
3neither sh alt thou make marriages 
with them  thy daughter thou shalt not 
give unto his son  nor his daughter 
shalt thou take unto thy son  4for he 
will turn away thy son from following 
me that they may serve other gods  so 
will the anger of the lord be kindled 7 deuteronomy  
262 
 against you  and he will destroy thee 
quickly  5but thus shall ye deal with 
them  ye shall break down their altars  
and dash in pieces their pillars  and 
hew down their asherim  and burn 
their graven images with fire  6for 
thou art a holy people unto the lord 
thy god  the lord thy god hath 
chosen thee to be his own treasure  
out of all peoples that are upon the 
face of the earth  7the lord did not set 
his love upon you  nor choose you  
because ye were more in number than 
any people for ye were the fewest of 
all peoples  8but because the lord 
loved you  and because he would keep 
the oath which he swore unto your 
fathers  hath the lord brought you out 
with a mighty hand  and redeemed you 
out of the house of bondage  from the 
hand of pharaoh king of egypt  9know 
therefore that the lord thy god  he is 
god the faithful god  who keepeth 
covenant and mercy with them that 
love him and keep his 
commandments to a thousand 
generations  10and repayeth them that 
hate him to their face  to destroy 
them  he will not be slack t o him that 
hateth him  he will repay him to his 
face 11thou shalt therefore keep the 
commandment  and the statutes  and 
the ordinances  which i command thee 
this day  to do them   
 
 
12and it shall come to pass  because 
ye hearken to these ordinances  and 
keep  and do them  that the lord thy god shall keep with thee the covenant 
and the mercy which he swore unto 
thy fathers  13and he will love thee  
and bless thee  and multiply thee  he 
will also bless the fruit of thy body and 
the fruit of thy land  thy corn and thy 
wine and thine oil  the increase of thy 
kine and the young of thy flock  in the 
land which he swore unto thy fathers 
to give thee  14thou shalt be blessed 
above all peoples  there shall not be 
male or female barren among you  or 
among your ca ttle 15and the lord will 
take away from thee all sickness  and 
he will put none of the evil diseases of 
egypt  which thou knowest  upon thee  
but will lay them upon all them that 
hate thee  16and thou shalt consume all 
the peoples that the lord thy god sh all 
deliver unto thee  thine eye shall not 
pity them  neither shalt thou serve 
their gods  for that will be a snare unto 
thee  
17if thou shalt say in thy heart  
these nations are more than i  how 
can i dispossess them  18thou shalt 
not be afraid of them  thou shalt well 
remember what the lord thy god did 
unto pharaoh  and unto all egypt  19the 
great trials which thine eyes saw  and 
the signs  and the wonders  and the 
mighty hand  and the outstretched arm  
whereby the lord thy god brought 
thee out  so sha ll the lord thy god do 
unto all the peoples of whom thou art 
afraid  20moreover the lord thy god 
will send the hornet among them  until 
they that are left  and they that hide 
themselves  perish from before thee  deuteronomy  
263 
 21thou shalt not be affrighted at them  
for the lord thy god is in the midst of 
thee a god great and awful  22and the 
lord thy god will cast out those 
nations before thee by little and little  
thou mayest not consume them 
quickly  lest the beasts of the field 
increase upon thee  23but the lord thy 
god shall deliver them up before thee  
and shall discomfit them with a great 
discomfiture  until they be destroyed  
24and he shall deliver their kings into 
thy hand  and thou shalt make their 
name to perish from under heaven  
there shall no man be able to stand 
against thee  until thou have destroyed 
them  25the graven images of their 
gods shall ye burn with fire  thou shalt 
not covet the silver or the gold that is 
on them  nor take it unto thee  lest thou 
be snared therein  for it is an 
abomination to the lord thy god  
26and thou shalt not bring an 
abomination into thy house  and be 
accursed like unto it  thou shalt utterly 
detest it  and thou shalt utterly abhor 
it for it is a devoted thing   
all the commandment which i 
command thee this day shall ye 
observe to do  that ye may live  and 
multiply  and go in and possess the 
land which the lord swore unto your 
fathers  2and thou shalt remember all 
the way which the lord thy god hath 
led thee these forty years in the 
wilderness  that he might afflict thee  
to prove thee  to know what was in thy 
heart  whether thou wouldest keep his 
commandments  or no  3and he afflicted thee  and suffered thee to 
hunger  and fed thee with manna  
which thou knewest not  neither did 
thy fathers know  that he might make 
thee kno w that man doth not live by 
bread only  but by every thing that 
proceedeth out of the mouth of the 
lord doth man live  4thy raiment 
waxed not old upon thee  neither did 
thy foot swell  these forty years  5and 
thou shalt consider in thy heart  that as 
a ma n chasteneth his son  so the lord 
thy god chasteneth thee  6and thou 
shalt keep the commandments of the 
lord thy god  to walk in his ways  
and to fear him  7for the lord thy 
god bringeth thee into a good land  a 
land of brooks of water  of fountains 
and de pths springing forth in valleys 
and hills  8a land of wheat and barley  
and vines and fig trees and 
pomegranates  a land of olive trees 
and honey  9a land wherein thou shalt 
eat bread without scarceness  thou 
shalt not lack any thing in it  a land 
whose s tones are iron  and out of 
whose hills thou mayest dig brass  
10and thou shalt eat and be satisfied  
and bless the lord thy god for the 
good land which he hath given thee  
11beware lest thou forget the lord thy 
god in not keeping his 
commandments  and his  ordinances  
and his statutes  which i command 
thee this day  12lest when thou hast 
eaten and art satisfied  and hast built 
goodly houses  and dwelt therein  
13and when thy herds and thy flocks 
multiply  and thy silver and thy gold is 8 deuteronomy  
264 
 multiplied  and all t hat thou hast is 
multiplied  14then thy heart be lifted 
up and thou forget the lord thy god  
who brought thee forth out of the land 
of egypt  out of the house of bondage  
15who led thee through the great and 
dreadful wilderness  wherein were 
serpents  fiery serpents  and scorpions  
and thirsty ground where was no 
water  who brought thee forth water 
out of the rock of flint  16who fed thee 
in the wilderness with manna  which 
thy fathers knew not  that he might 
afflict thee  and that he might prove 
thee to do thee good at thy latter end  
17and thou say in thy heart  my power 
and the might of my hand hath gotten 
me this wealth  18but thou shalt 
remember the lord thy god  for it is 
he that giveth thee power to get 
wealth  that he may establish his 
covenant w hich he swore unto thy 
fathers  as it is this day   
19and it shall be  if thou shalt forget 
the lord thy god  and walk after other 
gods  and serve them  and worship 
them  i forewarn you this day that ye 
shall surely perish  20as the nations 
that the lord maketh to perish before 
you so shall ye perish  because ye 
would not hearken unto the voice of 
the lord your god   
hear  o israel  thou art to pass 
over the jordan this day  to go in 
to dispossess nations greater and 
mightier than thyself  cities great a nd 
fortified up to heaven  2a people great 
and tall  the sons of the anakim  
whom thou knowest  and of whom thou hast heard say  who can stand 
before the sons of anak  3know 
therefore this day  that the lord thy 
god is he who goeth over before thee 
as a devouring fire  he will destroy 
them  and he will bring them down 
before thee  so shalt thou drive them 
out and make them to perish quickly  
as the lord hath spoken unto thee  
4speak not thou in thy heart  after that 
the lord thy god hath thrust them out 
from before thee  saying  for my 
righteousness the lord hath brought 
me in to possess this land  whereas 
for the wickedness of these nations the 
lord doth drive them out from before 
thee 5not for thy righteousness  or for 
the uprightness of thy heart  dost thou 
go in to possess their land  but for the 
wickedness of these nations the lord 
thy god doth drive them out from 
before thee  and that he may establish 
the word which the lord swore unto 
thy fathers  to abraham  to isaac  and 
to jacob  6know therefo re that it is not 
for thy righteousness that the lord thy 
god giveth thee this good land to 
possess it  for thou art a stiffnecked 
people   
7remember  forget thou not  how 
thou didst make the lord thy god 
wroth in the wilderness  from the day 
that thou did st go forth out of the land 
of egypt  until ye came unto this place  
ye have been rebellious against the 
lord 8also in horeb ye made the 
lord wroth  and the lord was angered 
with you to have destroyed you  
9when i was gone up into the mount to 9 deuteronomy  
265 
 receive the  tables of stone  even the 
tables of the covenant which the lord 
made with you  then i abode in the 
mount forty days and forty nights  i 
did neither eat bread nor drink water  
10and the lord delivered unto me the 
two tables of stone written with the 
finger  of god  and on them was 
written according to all the words  
which the lord spoke with you in the 
mount out of the midst of the fire in 
the day of the assembly  11and it came 
to pass at the end of forty days and 
forty nights  that the lord gave me the 
two tables of stone  even the tables of 
the covenant  12and the lord said unto 
me arise  get thee down quickly 
from hence  for thy people that thou 
hast brought forth out of egypt have 
dealt corruptly  they are quickly turned 
aside out of the way which i 
commanded them  they have made 
them a molten image  13furthermore 
the lord spoke unto me  saying  i 
have seen this people  and behold  it is 
a stiffnecked people  14let me alone  
that i may destroy them  and blot out 
their name from under heaven  and i 
will make of thee a nation mightier 
and greater than they  15so i turned 
and came down from the mount  and 
the mount burned with fire  and the 
two tables of the covenant were in my 
two hands  16and i looked  and 
behold  ye had sinned against the lord 
your g od ye had made you a molten 
calf ye had turned aside quickly out of 
the way which the lord had 
commanded you  17and i took hold of the two tables  and cast them out of my 
two hands  and broke them before your 
eyes 18and i fell down before the 
lord as at the first  forty days and 
forty nights  i did neither eat bread nor 
drink water  because of all your sin 
which ye sinned  in doing that which 
was evil in the sight of the lord to 
provoke him  19for i was in dread of 
the anger and hot displeasure  
wherew ith the lord was wroth against 
you to destroy you  but the lord 
hearkened unto me that time also  
20moreover the lord was very angry 
with aaron to have destroyed him  and 
i prayed for aaron also the same time  
21and i took your sin  the calf which 
ye had m ade and burnt it with fire  
and beat it in pieces  grinding it very 
small  until it was as fine as dust  and i 
cast the dust thereof into the brook that 
descended out of the mount  22and 
at taberah  and at massah  and at 
kibroth hattaavah  ye made the lord 
wroth  23and when the lord sent you 
from kadesh barnea  saying  go up 
and possess the land which i have 
given you  then ye rebelled against 
the commandment of the lord your 
god and ye believed him not  nor 
hearkened to his voice  24ye have 
been rebel lious against the lord from 
the day that i knew you  25so i fell 
down before the lord the forty days 
and forty nights that i fell down  
because the lord had said he would 
destroy you  26and i prayed unto the 
lord and said  o lord g od destroy 
not thy pe ople and thine inheritance  deuteronomy  
266 
 that thou hast redeemed through thy 
greatness  that thou hast brought forth 
out of egypt with a mighty hand  
27remember thy servants  abraham  
isaac  and jacob  look not unto the 
stubbornness of this people  nor to 
their wickedn ess nor to their sin  28lest 
the land whence thou broughtest us 
out say  because the lord was not 
able to bring them into the land which 
he promised unto them  and because 
he hated them  he hath brought them 
out to slay them in the wilderness  
29yet they are thy people and thine 
inheritance  that thou didst bring out 
by thy great power and by thy 
outstretched arm   
at that time the lord said unto 
me hew thee two tables of 
stone like unto the first  and come up 
unto me into the mount  and make 
thee an  ark of wood  2and i will write 
on the tables the words that were on 
the first tables which thou didst break  
and thou shalt put them in the ark  3so 
i made an ark of acacia wood  and 
hewed two tables of stone like unto the 
first and went up into the mou nt 
having the two tables in my hand  
4and he wrote on the tables according 
to the first writing  the ten words  
which the lord spoke unto you in the 
mount out of the midst of the fire in 
the day of the assembly  and the lord 
gave them unto me  5and i turn ed and 
came down from the mount  and put 
the tables in the ark which i had made  
and there they are  as the lord 
commanded me  6and the children of israel journeyed from beeroth 
benejaakan to moserah  there aaron 
died and there he was buried  and 
eleazar  his son ministered in the 
priest s office in his stead  7from 
thence they journeyed unto gudgod  
and from gudgod to jotbah  a land of 
brooks of water  8at that time the 
lord separated the tribe of levi  to 
bear the ark of the covenant of the 
lord to sta nd before the lord to 
minister unto him  and to bless in his 
name  unto this day  9wherefore levi 
hath no portion nor inheritance with 
his brethren  the lord is his 
inheritance  according as the lord thy 
god spoke unto him 10now i stayed 
in the mount  as at the first time  forty 
days and forty nights  and the lord 
hearkened unto me that time also  the 
lord would not destroy thee  11and 
the lord said unto me  arise  go 
before the people  causing them to set 
forward  that they may go in and 
possess the land  which i swore unto 
their fathers to give unto them   
12and now  israel  what doth the 
lord thy god require of thee  but to 
fear the lord thy god  to walk in all 
his ways  and to love him  and to 
serve the lord thy god with all thy 
heart and with all thy  soul 13to keep 
for thy good the commandments of the 
lord and his statutes  which i 
command thee this day  14behold  
unto the lord thy god belongeth the 
heaven  and the heaven of heavens  the 
earth  with all that therein is  15only 
the lord had a delight  in thy fathers to 10 deuteronomy  
267 
 love them  and he chose their seed 
after them  even you  above all 
peoples  as it is this day  16circumcise 
therefore the foreskin of your heart  
and be no more stiffnecked  17for the 
lord your god  he is god of gods  
and lord of lords  the great god  the 
mighty  and the awful  who regardeth 
not persons  nor taketh reward  18he 
doth execute justice for the fatherless 
and widow  and loveth the stranger  in 
giving him food and raiment  19love 
ye therefore the stranger  for ye were 
strangers  in the land of egypt  20thou 
shalt fear the lord thy god  him shalt 
thou serve  and to him shalt thou 
cleave  and by his name shalt thou 
swear  21he is thy glory  and he is thy 
god that hath done for thee these 
great and tremendous things  which 
thine ey es have seen  22thy fathers 
went down into egypt with threescore 
and ten persons  and now the lord thy 
god hath made thee as the stars of 
heaven for multitude   
therefore thou shalt love the 
lord thy god  and keep his 
charge  and his statutes  and his 
ordinances  and his commandments  
alway  2and know ye this day  for i 
speak not with your children that have 
not known  and that have not seen the 
chastisement of the lord your god  
his greatness  his mighty hand  and 
his outstretched arm  3and his signs  
and his works  which he did in the 
midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king 
of egypt  and unto all his land  4and 
what he did unto the army of egypt  unto their horses  and to their chariots  
how he made the water of the red sea 
to overflow them as they pursued  after 
you and how the lord hath destroyed 
them unto this day  5and what he did 
unto you in the wilderness  until ye 
came unto this place  6and what he did 
unto dathan and abiram  the sons of 
eliab  the son of reuben  how the 
earth opened her mouth  and 
swallowed them up  and their 
households  and their tents  and every 
living substance that followed them  in 
the midst of all israel  7but your eyes 
have seen all the great work of the 
lord which he did  8therefore shall 
ye keep all the commandment which i 
command thee this day  that ye may be 
strong  and go in and possess the land  
whither ye go over to possess it  9and 
that ye may prolong your days upon 
the land  which the lord swore unto 
your fathers to give unto them and to 
their seed  a land flowing with  milk 
and honey   
10for the land  whither thou goest in 
to possess it  is not as the land of 
egypt  from whence ye came out  
where thou didst sow thy seed  and 
didst water it with thy foot  as a garden 
of herbs  11but the land  whither ye go 
over to posses s it is a land of hills and 
valleys  and drinketh water as the rain 
of heaven cometh down  12a land 
which the lord thy god careth for  the 
eyes of the lord thy god are always 
upon it  from the beginning of the year 
even unto the end of the year   11 deuteronomy  
268 
 13and it  shall come to pass  if ye 
shall hearken diligently unto my 
commandments which i command you 
this day  to love the lord your god  
and to serve him with all your heart 
and with all your soul  14that i will 
give the rain of your land in its season  
the forme r rain and the latter rain  that 
thou mayest gather in thy corn  and thy 
wine  and thine oil  15and i will give 
grass in thy fields for thy cattle  and 
thou shalt eat and be satisfied  16take 
heed to yourselves  lest your heart be 
deceived  and ye turn asi de and serve 
other gods  and worship them  17and 
the anger of the lord be kindled 
against you  and he shut up the 
heaven  so that there shall be no rain  
and the ground shall not yield her fruit  
and ye perish quickly from off the 
good land which the lord giveth you  
18therefore shall ye lay up these my 
words in your heart and in your soul  
and ye shall bind them for a sign upon 
your hand  and they shall be for 
frontlets between your eyes  19and ye 
shall teach them your children  talking 
of them  when thou  sittest in thy 
house  and when thou walkest by the 
way and when thou liest down  and 
when thou risest up  20and thou shalt 
write them upon the door posts of thy 
house  and upon thy gates  21that your 
days may be multiplied  and the days 
of your children  upon the land which 
the lord swore unto your fathers to 
give them  as the days of the heavens 
above the earth   22for if ye shall diligently keep all 
this commandment which i command 
you to do it  to love the lord your 
god to walk in all his ways  and t o 
cleave unto him  23then will the lord 
drive out all these nations from before 
you and ye shall dispossess nations 
greater and mightier than yourselves  
24every place whereon the sole of your 
foot shall tread shall be yours  from 
the wilderness  and leba non from the 
river  the river euphrates  even unto 
the hinder sea shall be your border  
25there shall no man be able to stand 
against you  the lord your god shall 
lay the fear of you and the dread of 
you upon all the land that ye shall 
tread upon  as he h ath spoken unto 
you  
 
26behold  i set before you this day a 
blessing and a curse  27the blessing  if 
ye shall hearken unto the 
commandments of the lord your god  
which i command you this day  28and 
the curse  if ye shall not hearken unto 
the commandments of the lord your 
god but turn aside out of the way 
which i command you this day  to go 
after other gods  which ye have not 
known   
29and it shall come to pass  when 
the lord thy god shall bring thee into 
the land whither thou goest to possess 
it that thou shalt set the ble ssing upon 
mount gerizim  and the curse upon 
mount ebal  30are they not beyond the 
jordan  behind the way of the going 
down of the sun  in the land of the deuteronomy  
269 
 canaanites that dwell in the arabah  
over against gilgal  beside the 
terebinths of moreh  31for ye ar e to 
pass over the jordan to go in to 
possess the land which the lord your 
god giveth you  and ye shall possess 
it and dwell therein  32and ye shall 
observe to do all the statutes and the 
ordinances which i set before you this 
day  
 
these are the stat utes and the 
ordinances  which ye shall 
observe to do in the land which the 
lord the god of thy fathers  hath 
given thee to possess it  all the days 
that ye live upon the earth  2ye shall 
surely destroy all the places  wherein 
the nations that ye are to d ispossess 
served their gods  upon the high 
mountains  and upon the hills  and 
under every leafy tree  3and ye shall 
break down their altars  and dash in 
pieces their pillars  and burn their 
asherim with fire  and ye shall hew 
down the graven images of thei r gods  
and ye shall destroy their name out of 
that place  4ye shall not do so unto the 
lord your god  5but unto the place 
which the lord your god shall choose 
out of all your tribes to put his name 
there  even unto his habitation shall ye 
seek and thithe r thou shalt come  6and 
thither ye shall bring your burnt 
offerings  and your sacrifices  and your 
tithes  and the offering of your hand  
and your vows  and your freewill 
offerings  and the firstlings of your 
herd and of your flock  7and there ye shall eat  before the lord your god  
and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put 
your hand unto  ye and your 
households  wherein the lord thy god 
hath blessed thee  8ye shall not do 
after all that we do here this day  every 
man whatsoever is right in his own 
eyes 9for ye are not as yet come to the 
rest and to the inheritance  which the 
lord your god giveth thee  10but 
when ye go over the jordan  and dwell 
in the land which the lord your god 
causeth you to inherit  and he giveth 
you rest from all your enemies round 
about  so that ye dwell in safety  11then 
it shall come to pass that the place 
which the lord your god shall choose 
to cause his name to dwell there  
thither shall ye bring all that i 
command you  your burnt offerings  
and your sacrifices  your tithes  and 
the offering of your hand  and all your 
choice vows which ye vow unto the 
lord 12and ye shall rejoice before the 
lord your god  ye and your sons  and 
your daughters  and your men 
servants  and your maid servants  and 
the levite that is within your gates  
forasmuch as he hath no portion nor 
inheritance with you  13take heed to 
thyself that thou offer not thy burnt 
offerings in every place that thou 
seest  14but in the place which the lord 
shall choose in one of thy tribes  there 
thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings  
and there thou shalt do all that i 
command thee   
15notwithstanding thou mayest kill 
and eat flesh within all thy gates  after 12 deuteronomy  
270 
 all the desire of thy soul  according to 
the blessing of the lord thy god 
which he hath given thee  the unclean 
and the cl ean may eat thereof  as of the 
gazelle  and as of the hart  16only ye 
shall not eat the blood  thou shalt pour 
it out upon the earth as water  17thou 
mayest not eat within thy gates the 
tithe of thy corn  or of thy wine  or of 
thine oil  or the firstlings of thy herd or 
of thy flock  nor any of thy vows 
which thou vowest  nor thy freewill 
offerings  nor the offering of thy hand  
18but thou shalt eat them before the 
lord thy god in the place which the 
lord thy god shall choose  thou and 
thy son  and thy dau ghter  and thy 
manservant  and thy maid servant  
and the levite that is within thy gates  
and thou shalt rejoice before the lord 
thy god in all that thou puttest thy 
hand unto  19take heed to thyself that

desireth to eat flesh  thou mayest eat 
flesh  after all the desire of thy soul  
21if the place which the lord thy god

too far from thee  then thou shalt kill 
of thy herd and of thy flock  which the 
lord hath given thee  as i have 
commanded thee  and thou shalt eat

thyself that thou be not ensnared to

lord your god who brought you out 
of the land of egypt  and redeemed 
thee out of the house of bondage  to 
draw thee aside out of the way which

about you  nigh unto thee  or far off 
from thee  from the one end of the 
earth even unto the other end of the 
earth  9thou shalt not consent unto him  
nor hearken unto him  neither shall 
thine eye pity him  neither shalt thou 
spare  neith er shalt thou conceal him  
10but thou shalt surely kill him  thy 
hand shall be first upon him to put him 
to death  and afterwards the hand of all

with stones  that he die  because he 
hath sought to draw thee away from  
the lord thy god  who brought thee 
out of the land of egypt  out of the 
house of bondage  12and all israel

edge of the sword  destroying it 13 deuteronomy  
272 
 utterly and all that is therein and the 
cattle thereof  with the edge of the 
sword  17and thou shalt gather all the 
spoil of it into the midst of the broad 
place thereof  and shall burn with fire 
the city  and all the spoil thereof every 
whit unto the lord thy god  and it 
shall be a heap for ever  it shall not be 
built again  18and there shall cleave

hand  that the lord may turn from the 
fierceness of his anger  and show thee 
mercy  and have compassion upon 
thee and multi ply thee  as he hath 
sworn unto thy fathers  19 when thou

21ye shall not eat of any thing that 
dieth of itself  thou mayest give it unto 
the stranger that is within thy gates  
that he may eat it  or thou mayest sell 
it unto a foreigner  for thou art a  holy 
people unto the lord thy god  thou 14 deuteronomy  
273

milk  
22thou shalt surely tithe all the 
increase of thy seed  that which is

23and thou shalt eat before the lord 
thy god  in the place  which he shall 
choose to cause his name to dwell 
there  the tithe of thy corn  of thy wine  
and of thine oil  and the firstlings of 
thy herd and of thy flock  that thou 
mayest learn to fear the lord thy god 
always  24and if the way be too long 
for thee  so that thou art not able to 
carry it  because the place is too far 
from thee  which the lord thy god 
shall choose to set his name there  
when the lord thy god shall bless 
thee 25then shalt thou turn it into 
money  and bind up the money in thy 
hand  and sh alt go unto the place 
which the lord thy god shall choose  
26and thou shalt bestow the money for 
whatsoever thy soul desireth  for oxen  
or for sheep  or for wine  or for strong 
drink  or for whatsoever thy soul 
asketh of thee  and thou shalt eat there 
before the lord thy god  and thou 
shalt rejoice  thou and thy household

thee  
28at the end of every three years  
even in the same year  thou s halt bring 
forth all the tithe of thine increase  and 
shall lay it up within thy gates  29and 
the levite  because he hath no portion 
nor inheritance with thee  and the stranger  and the fatherless  and the 
widow  that are within thy gates  shall 
come  and shall eat and be satisfied  
that the lord thy god may bless thee 
in all the work of thy hand which thou 
doest   
at the end of every seven 
years thou shalt make a 
release  2and this is the manner of the 
release  every creditor shall release 
that which he  hath lent unto his 
neighbour  he shall not exact it of his 
neighbour and his brother  because the 
lords release hath been proclaimed  
3of a foreigner thou mayest exact it  
but whatsoever of thine is with thy 
brother thy hand shall release  
4howbeit there  shall be no needy 
among you for the lord will surely 
bless thee in the land which the lord 
thy god giveth thee for an inheritance 
to possess it  5if only thou diligently

god to observe to do all this 
commandment whi ch i command thee

one of thy brethren  within any of thy 
gates  in thy land which the lord thy 
god giveth thee  thou shalt not harden 
thy heart  nor shut thy hand from thy 
needy brother  8but thou shalt surely 
open thy hand unto him  and shalt 
surely lend him suffi cient for his need 15 deuteronomy  
274 
 in that which he wanteth  9beware that 
there be not a base thought in thy 
heart  saying  the seventh year  the 
year of release  is at hand  and thine 
eye be evil against thy needy brother  
and thou give him nought  and he cry 
unto the lord against thee  and it be 
sin in thee  10thou shalt surely give 
him and thy heart shall not be grieved 
when thou givest unto him  because 
that for this thing the lord thy god 
will bless thee in all thy work  and in 
all that thou puttest thy hand unto  
11for the poor shall never cease out of 
the land  therefore i command thee  
saying  thou shalt surely open thy 
hand unto thy poor and needy brother  
in thy land   
12if thy brother  a hebrew man  or a 
hebrew woman  be sold unto thee  he 
shall serve thee s ix years  and in the 
seventh year thou shalt let him go free 
from thee  13and when thou lettest him 
go free from thee  thou shalt not let 
him go empty  14thou shalt furnish him 
liberally out of thy flock  and out of 
thy threshing floor  and out of thy 
wine press  of that wherewith the lord 
thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt 
give unto him  15and thou shalt 
remember that thou wast a bondman in 
the land of egypt  and the lord thy 
god redeemed thee  therefore i 
command thee this thing to day 16and 
it shall be  if he say unto thee  i will 
not go out from thee  because he 
loveth thee and thy house  because he 
fareth well with thee  17then thou shalt 
take an awl  and thrust it through his ear and into the door  and he shall be 
thy bondman for ever  and also unt o 
thy bondwoman thou shalt do 
likewise  18it shall not seem hard unto 
thee when thou lettest him go free 
from thee  for to the double of the hire 
of a hireling hath he served thee six 
years  and the lord thy god will bless 
thee in all that thou doest   
19all the firstling males that are born 
of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt 
sanctify unto the lord thy god  thou 
shalt do no work with the firstling of 
thine ox  nor shear the firstling of thy

hart 23only thou shalt not eat the 
blood thereof  thou shalt pour it out 
upon the ground as water

over thee  thou mayest not put a 
foreigner over thee  who is not thy 
brother  16only he shall not multiply 
horses to himself  nor cause the people 
to return to egypt  to the end that he 
should multiply horses  forasmuch as 
the lord hath said unto you  ye shall 
henceforth return no more that way  
17neither shall he multiply wives to 
himself  that his heart turn not away  
neither shall he greatly multiply to 
himself silve r and gold  18and it shall

which is before the priests the levites

among their brethren  the lord is their 
inheritance  as he hath spoken unto

that they shall give unto the priest the 
shoulder  and the two cheeks  and the 
maw  4the first fruits of thy corn  of 
thy wine  and of thine oil  and the first 
of the fleece of thy sheep  shalt thou 
give him  5for the lord thy god hath 
chosen him ou t of all thy tribes  to 
stand to minister in the name of the 
lord him and his sons for ever   
6and if a levite come from any of 
thy gates out of all israel  where he 
sojourneth  and come with all the 
desire of his soul unto the place which 
the lord shall choose  7then he shall 
minister in the name of the lord his 
god as all his brethren the levites do  
who stand there before the lord 
8they shall have like portions to eat  
beside that which is his due according

divination  a so othsayer  or an 
enchanter  or a sorcerer  11or a 
charmer  or one that consulteth a ghost 
or a familiar spirit  or a necromancer  
12for whosoever doeth these things is 
an abomination unto the lord and 
because of these abominations the 
lord thy god is drivi ng them out from 
before thee  13thou shalt be whole 
hearted with the lord thy god  14for 
these nations  that thou art to 
dispossess  hearken unto soothsayers  
and unto diviners  but as for thee  the 
lord thy god hath not suffered thee so 
to do  15a prophet  will the lord thy 
god raise up unto thee  from the midst 
of thee  of thy brethren  like unto me  
unto him ye shall hearken  16according 
to all that thou didst desire of the lord 
thy god in horeb in the day of the 
assembly  saying  let me not hear 
again t he voice of the lord my god  
neither let me see this great fire any 
more  that i die not  17and the lord 
said unto me  they have well said 
that which they have spoken  18i will 
raise them up a prophet from among 
their brethren  like unto thee  and i 
will put my words in his mouth  and 
he shall speak unto them all that i shall 
command him  19and it shall come to 
pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in 
my name  i will require it of him  
20but the prophet  that shall speak  a 
word presumptuously in my name  
which i have not commanded him to 
speak  or that shall speak in the name 
of other gods  that same prophet shall 
die 21and if thou say in thy heart  
how shall we know the word which 
the lord hath not spoken  22when a 
prophet speaketh in the name of the 
lord if the thing follow not  nor come 
to pass  that is the thing which the 
lord hath not spoken  the prophet hath 
spoken it presumptuously  thou shalt 
not be afraid of him   
when the lord thy god shall 
cut off the na tions  whose land 
the lord thy god giveth thee  and thou 
dost succeed them  and dwell in their 
cities  and in their houses  2thou shalt 
separate three cities for thee in the 
midst of thy land  which the lord thy 
god giveth thee to possess it  3thou 
shalt p repare thee the way  and divide 
the borders of thy land  which the 
lord thy god causeth thee to inherit  
into three parts  that every manslayer 
may flee thither  4and this is the case 
of the manslayer  that shall flee thither 
and live  whoso killeth his ne ighbour 
unawares  and hated him not in time 
past 5as when a man goeth into the 
forest with his neighbour to hew wood  
and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the 
axe to cut down the tree  and the head 
slippeth from the helve  and lighteth 
upon his neighbour  that he die  he 
shall flee unto one of these cities and 19 deuteronomy

the manslayer  while his heart is hot  
and overtake him  because the way is 
long and smite him mortally  whereas 
he was not deserving of death  
inasmuch as he hated him not in time 
past 7wherefore i command thee  
saying  thou shalt separate three 
cities for thee  8and if the lord thy 
god enlarge thy border  as he hath 
sworn unto thy fathers  and give thee 
all the land which he promised to give 
unto thy father s 9if thou shalt keep 
all this commandment to do it  which i 
command thee this day  to love the 
lord thy god  and to walk ever in his 
ways then shalt thou add three cities 
more for thee  beside these three  10that 
innocent blood be not shed in the 
midst o f thy land  which the lord thy 
god giveth thee for an inheritance  and 
so blood be upon thee   
11but if any man hate his neighbour  
and lie in wait for him  and rise up 
against him  and smite him mortally 
that he die  and he flee into one of 
these cities  12then the elders of his city 
shall send and fetch him thence  and 
deliver him into the hand of the 
avenger of blood  that he may die  
13thine eye shall not pity him  but thou 
shalt put away the blood of the 
innocent from israel  that it may go 
well with t hee  
14thou shalt not remove thy 
neighbour s landmark  which they of 
old time have set  in thine inheritance 
which thou shalt inherit  in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to 
possess it   
15one witness shall not rise up 
against a man for any iniq uity or for 
any sin  in any sin that he sinneth  at 
the mouth of two witnesses  or at the 
mouth of three witnesses  shall a 
matter be establishment16if an 
unrighteous witness rise up against any 
man to bear perverted witness against 
him 17then both the m en between 
whom the controversy is  shall stand 
before the lord before the priests and 
the judges that shall be in those days  
18and the judges shall inquire 
diligently  and behold  if the witness 
be a false witness  and hath testified 
falsely against h is brother  19then shall 
ye do unto him  as he had purposed to 
do unto his brother  so shalt thou put 
away the evil from the midst of thee  
20and those that remain shall hear  and 
fear and shall henceforth commit no 
more any such evil in the midst of 
thee 21and thine eye shall not pity  
life for life  eye for eye  tooth for 
tooth  hand for hand  foot for foot   
 
when thou goest forth to 
battle against thine enemies  
and seest horses  and chariots  and a 
people more than thou  thou shalt not 
be afraid o f them  for the lord thy 
god is with thee  who brought thee up 
out of the land of egypt  2and it shall 
be when ye draw nigh unto the battle  
that the priest shall approach and 
speak unto the people  3and shall say 
unto them  hear  o israel  ye draw 20 deuteronomy  
280 
 nigh this day unto battle against your 
enemies  let not your heart faint  fear 
not nor be alarmed  neither be ye 
affrighted at them  4for the lord your 
god is he that goeth with you  to fight 
for you against your enemies  to save 
you 5and the officers shall speak 
unto the people  saying  what man is 
there that hath built a new house  and 
hath not dedicated it  let him go and 
return to his house  lest he die in the 
battle  and another man dedicate it  
6and what man is there that hath 
planted a vineyard  and h ath not used 
the fruit thereof  let him go and return 
unto his house  lest he die in the battle  
and another man use the fruit thereof  
7and what man is there that hath 
betrothed a wife  and hath not taken 
her let him go and return unto his 
house  lest he  die in the battle  and 
another man take her  8and the 
officers shall speak further unto the 
people  and they shall say  what man 
is there that is fearful and faint 
hearted  let him go and return unto his 
house  lest his brethren s heart melt as 
his hear t 9and it shall be  when the 
officers have made an end of speaking 
unto the people  that captains of hosts 
shall be appointed at the head of the 
people   
10when thou drawest nigh unto a 
city to fight against it  then proclaim 
peace unto it  11and it shal l be if it 
make thee answer of peace  and open 
unto thee  then it shall be  that all the 
people that are found therein shall 
become tributary unto thee  and shall serve thee  12and if it will make no 
peace with thee  but will make war 
against thee  then t hou shalt besiege it  
13and when the lord thy god 
delivereth it into thy hand  thou shalt 
smite every male thereof with the edge 
of the sword  14but the women  and the 
little ones  and the cattle  and all that is 
in the city  even all the spoil thereof  
shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself  
and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine 
enemies  which the lord thy god hath 
given thee  15thus shalt thou do unto 
all the cities which are very far off 
from thee  which are not of the cities 
of these nations  16howbeit  of the 
cities of these peoples  that the lord 
thy god giveth thee for an inheritance  
thou shalt save alive nothing that 
breatheth  17but thou shalt utterly 
destroy them  the hittite  and the 
amorite  the canaanite  and the 
perizzite  the hivite  and the jebusite  
as the lord thy god hath commanded 
thee 18that they teach you not to do 
after all their abominations  which 
they have done unto their gods  and so 
ye sin against the lord your god   
19when thou shalt besiege a city a 
long time  in making war aga inst it to 
take it  thou shalt not destroy the trees 
thereof by wielding an axe against 
them  for thou mayest eat of them  but 
thou shalt not cut them down  for is 
the tree of the field man  that it should 
be besieged of thee  20only the trees 
of which tho u knowest that they are 
not trees for food  them thou mayest 
destroy and cut down  that thou mayest deuteronomy

 build bulwarks against the city that 
maketh war with thee  until it fall   
if one be found slain in the 
land which the lord thy god 
giveth thee to posses s it lying in the 
field and it be not known who hath 
smitten him  2then thy elders and thy 
judges shall come forth  and they shall 
measure unto the cities which are 
round about him that is slain  3and it 
shall be  that the city which is nearest 
unto the slain man  even the elders of 
that city shall take a heifer of the herd  
which hath not been wrought with  and 
which hath not drawn in the yoke  
4and the elders of that city shall bring 
down the heifer unto a rough valley  
which may neither be plowed nor 
sown and shall break the heifer s neck 
there in the valley  5and the priests the 
sons of levi shall come near for 
them the lord thy god hath chosen to 
minister unto him  and to bless in the 
name of the lord and according to 
their word shall every controve rsy and 
every stroke be  6and all the elders of 
that city  who are nearest unto the slain 
man shall wash their hands over the 
heifer whose neck was broken in the 
valley  7and they shall speak and say  
our hands have not shed this blood  
neither have our eyes seen it  8forgive  
o lord thy people israel  whom 
thou hast redeemed  and suffer not 
innocent blood to remain in the midst 
of thy people israel  and the blood 
shall be forgiven them  9so shalt thou 
put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee  when thou shalt do that 
which is right in the eyes of the lord  
 
   
10when thou goest forth to battle 
against thine enemies  and the lord 
thy god delivereth them into thy 
hands  and thou carriest them away 
captive  11and seest among the captives 
a wo man of goodly form  and thou 
hast a desire unto her  and wouldest 
take her to thee to wife  12then thou 
shalt bring her home to thy house  and 
she shall shave her head  and pare her 
nails  13and she shall put the raiment of 
her captivity from off her  and shall 
remain in thy house  and bewail her 
father and her mother a full month  
and after that thou mayest go in unto 
her and be her husband  and she shall 
be thy wife  14and it shall be  if thou 
have no delight in her  then thou shalt 
let her go whither sh e will  but thou 
shalt not sell her at all for money  thou 
shalt not deal with her as a slave  
because thou hast humbled her   
15if a man have two wives  the one 
beloved  and the other hated  and they 
have borne him children  both the 
beloved and the hated  and if the first 
born son be hers that was hated  16then 
it shall be  in the day that he causeth 
his sons to inherit that which he hath  
that he may not make the son of the 
beloved the first born before the son of 
the hated  who is the first born 17but 
he shall acknowledge the first born 
the son of the hated  by giving him a 
double portion of all that he hath  for 21 deuteronomy  
282 
 he is the first fruits of his strength  the 
right of the first born is his   
18if a man have a stubborn and 
rebellious son  that will not hea rken to 
the voice of his father  or the voice of 
his mother  and though they chasten 
him will not hearken unto them  
19then shall his father and his mother 
lay hold on him  and bring him out 
unto the elders of his city  and unto the 
gate of his place  20and they shall say 
unto the elders of his city  this our 
son is stubborn and rebellious  he doth 
not hearken to our voice  he is a 
glutton  and a drunkard  21and all the 
men of his city shall stone him with 
stones  that he die  so shalt thou put 
away the evil from the midst of thee  
and all israel shall hear  and fear   
22and if a man have committed a sin 
worthy of death  and he be put to 
death  and thou hang him on a tree  
23his body shall not remain all night 
upon the tree  but thou shalt surely 
bury him  the same day  for he that is 
hanged is a reproach unto god  that 
thou defile not thy land which the 
lord thy god giveth thee for an 
inheritance   
thou shalt not see thy 
brother s ox or his sheep 
driven away  and hide thyself from 
them  thou shalt surel y bring them 
back unto thy brother  2and if thy 
brother be not nigh unto thee  and thou 
know him not  then thou shalt bring it 
home to thy house  and it shall be with 
thee until thy brother require it  and 
thou shalt restore it to him  3and so shalt thou d o with his ass  and so shalt 
thou do with his garment  and so shalt 
thou do with every lost thing of thy 
brother s which he hath lost  and thou 
hast found  thou mayest not hide 
thyself

or his ox fallen down by the w ay and 
hide thyself from them  thou shalt 
surely help him to lift them up again   
5a woman shall not wear that which 
pertaineth unto a man  neither shall a 
man put on a woman s garment  for 
whosoever doeth these things is an 
abomination unto the lord thy god  
6if a bird s nest chance to be before 
thee in the way  in any tree or on the 
ground  with young ones or eggs  and 
the dam sitting upon the young  or 
upon the eggs  thou shalt not take the 
dam with the young  7thou shalt in any 
wise let the dam go  but the young 
thou mayest take unto thyself  that it 
may be well with thee  and that thou 
mayest prolong thy days   
8when thou buildest a new house  
then thou shalt make a parapet for thy 
roof that thou bring not blood upon 
thy house  if any man fall from t hence   
9thou shalt not sow thy vineyard 
with two kinds of seed  lest the fulness 
of the seed which thou hast sown be 
forfeited together with the increase of 
the vineyard

cords upon the four corners of thy 
covering  wherewith thou coverest 
thyself   
13if any man take a wife  and go in 
unto her  and hate her  14and lay 
wanton charges against her  and bring 
up an evil name upon her  and say  i 
took this woman  and when i came 
nigh to her  i found not in her the 
tokens of virginity  15then shall the 
father of the damsel  and her mother  
take and bring forth the tokens of the 
damsel s virginity unto the elders of 
the city in the gate  16and the damsel s 
father shall say unto the elders  i gave 
my daughter unto this man to wife  
and he hateth her  17and lo he hath 
laid wanton charges  saying  i found 
not in thy daughter the tokens of 
virginity  and yet these a re the tokens 
of my daughter s virginity  and they 
shall spread the garment before the 
elders of the city  18and the elders of 
that city shall take the man and 
chastise him  19and they shall fine him 
a hundred shekels of silver  and give 
them unto the fat her of the damsel  
because he hath brought up an evil 
name upon a virgin of israel  and she 
shall be his wife  he may not put her 
away all his days   
20but if this thing be true  that the 
tokens of virginity were not found in 
the damsel  21then they shall bring out 
the damsel to the door of her father s 
house  and the men of her city shall 
stone her with stones that she die  
because she hath wrought a wanton deed in israel  to play the harlot in her 
father s house  so shalt thou put away 
the evil from the m idst of thee   
22if a man be found lying with a 
woman married to a husband  then 
they shall both of them die  the man 
that lay with the woman  and the 
woman  so shalt thou put away the evil 
from israel   
23if there be a damsel that is a virgin 
betrothed un to a man  and a man find 
her in the city  and lie with her  24then 
ye shall bring them both out unto the 
gate of that city  and ye shall stone 
them with stones that they die  the 
damsel  because she cried not  being in 
the city  and the man  because he hat h 
humbled his neighbour s wife  so thou 
shalt put away the evil from the midst 
of thee   
25but if the man find the damsel that 
is betrothed in the field  and the man 
take hold of her  and lie with her  then 
the man only that lay with her shall 
die 26but u nto the damsel thou shalt 
do nothing  there is in the damsel no 
sin worthy of death  for as when a man 
riseth against his neighbour  and 
slayeth him  even so is this matter  
27for he found her in the field  the 
betrothed damsel cried  and there was 
none to  save her   
28if a man find a damsel that is a 
virgin  that is not betrothed  and lay 
hold on her  and lie with her  and they 
be found  29then the man that lay with 
her shall give unto the damsel s father

4an ammonite or a moabite shall 
not enter into the assembly of the 
lord even to the tenth generation 
shall none of t hem enter into the 
assembly of the lord for ever  
5because they met you not with bread 
and with water in the way  when ye 
came forth out of egypt  and because 
they hired against thee balaam the son 
of beor from pethor of aram 
naharaim  to curse thee  6neve rtheless 
the lord thy god would not hearken 
unto balaam  but the lord thy god 
turned the curse into a blessing unto 
thee because the lord thy god loved 
thee 7thou shalt not seek their peace 
nor their prosperity all thy days for 
ever

for he is thy brother  thou shalt not 
abhor an egyptian  because thou wast 
a stranger in his land  9the children of 
the third generation that are born unto 
them may enter into the assembly of 
the lord  
10when thou goest forth in camp 
agains t thine enemies  then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing  11if 
there be among you any man  that is 
not clean by reason of that which 
chanceth him by night  then shall he 
go abroad out of the camp  he shall not 
come within the camp  12but it shall 
be when evening cometh on  he shall 
bathe himself in water  and when the 
sun is down  he may come within the 
camp  13thou shalt have a place also 
without the camp  whither thou shalt 
go forth abroad  14and thou shalt have 
a paddle among thy weapons  and it  
shall be  when thou sittest down 
abroad  thou shalt dig therewith  and 
shalt turn back and cover that which 
cometh from thee  15for the lord thy 
god walketh in the midst of thy camp  
to deliver thee  and to give up thine 
enemies before thee  therefore sha ll 
thy camp be holy  that he see no 
unseemly thing in thee  and turn away 
from thee   
16thou shalt not deliver unto his 
master a bondman that is escaped from 
his master unto thee  17he shall dwell 
with thee  in the midst of thee  in the 
place which he shal l choose within one 
of thy gates  where it liketh him best  
thou shalt not wrong him   
18there shall be no harlot of the 
daughters of israel  neither shall there 
be a sodomite of the sons of israel  
19thou shalt not bring the hire of a 
harlot  or the price  of a dog  into the 
house of the lord thy god for any 
vow for even both these are an 
abomination unto the lord thy god   23 deuteronomy  
285 
 20thou shalt not lend upon interest 
to thy brother  interest of money  
interest of victuals  interest of any 
thing that is lent upon i nterest  21unto

interest  but unto thy brother thou shalt 
not lend upon interest  that the lord 
thy god may bless thee in all that thou 
puttest thy hand unto  in the land 
whither thou goest in to possess it   
22when thou s halt vow a vow unto 
the lord thy god  thou shalt not be 
slack to pay it  for the lord thy god 
will surely require it of thee  and it 
will be sin in thee  23but if thou shalt 
forbear to vow  it shall be no sin in 
thee 24that which is gone out of thy 
lips t hou shalt observe and do  
according as thou hast vowed freely 
unto the lord thy god  even that 
which thou hast promised with thy 
mouth   
25when thou comest into thy 
neighbour s vineyard  then thou 
mayest eat grapes until thou have 
enough at thine own pleas ure but thou

neighbour s standing corn  then thou 
mayest pluck ears with thy hand  but 
thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy 
neighbour s standing corn   
when a man taketh a wife  and 
marriet h her  then it cometh to 
pass if she find no favour in his eyes  
because he hath found some unseemly 
thing in her  that he writeth her a bill 
of divorcement  and giveth it in her 
hand  and sendeth her out of his house  2and she departeth out of his house  
and goeth and becometh another man s 
wife 3and the latter husband hateth 
her and writeth her a bill of 
divorcement  and giveth it in her hand  
and sendeth her out of his house  or if 
the latter husband die  who took her to 
be his wife  4her former husba nd who 
sent her away  may not take her again 
to be his wife  after that she is defiled  
for that is abomination before the 
lord and thou shalt not cause the land 
to sin  which the lord thy god giveth 
thee for an inheritance   
5when a man taketh a new wif e he 
shall not go out in the host  neither 
shall he be charged with any business  
he shall be free for his house one year  
and shall cheer his wife whom he hath 
taken   
6no man shall take the mill or the 
upper millstone to pledge  for he 
taketh a man s life to pledge   
7if a man be found stealing any of 
his brethren of the children of israel  
and he deal with him as a slave  and 
sell him  then that thief shall die  so 
shalt thou put away the evil from the 
midst of thee   
8take heed in the plague of leprosy  
that thou observe diligently  and do 
according to all that the priests the 
levites shall teach you  as i 
commanded them  so ye shall observe 
to do  9remember what the lord thy 
god did unto miriam  by the way as ye 
came forth out of egypt   
10when thou do st lend thy 
neighbour any manner of loan  thou 24 deuteronomy  
286 
 shalt not go into his house to fetch his 
pledge  11thou shalt stand without  and 
the man to whom thou dost lend shall 
bring forth the pledge without unto 
thee 12and if he be a poor man  thou 
shalt not sleep w ith his pledge  13thou 
shalt surely restore to him the pledge 
when the sun goeth down  that he may 
sleep in his garment  and bless thee  
and it shall be righteousness unto thee 
before the lord thy god   
14thou shalt not oppress a hired 
servant that is poor  and needy  whether 
he be of thy brethren  or of thy 
strangers that are in thy land within thy 
gates  15in the same day thou shalt give 
him his hire  neither shall the sun go 
down upon it  for he is poor  and 
setteth his heart upon it  lest he cry 
against thee unto the lord and it be sin 
in thee   
16the fathers shall not be put to 
death for the children  neither shall the 
children be put to death for the fathers  
every man shall be put to death for his 
own sin   
17thou shalt not pervert the justice 
due to t he stranger  or to the fatherless  
nor take the widow s raiment to 
pledge  18but thou shalt remember that 
thou wast a bondman in egypt  and the 
lord thy god redeemed thee thence  
therefore i command thee to do this 
thing   
19when thou reapest thy harvest i n 
thy field  and hast forgot a sheaf in the 
field thou shalt not go back to fetch it  
it shall be for the stranger  for the 
fatherless  and for the widow  that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the 
work of thy hands   
20when thou beatest thine olive tree 
thou shalt not go over the boughs 
again  it shall be for the stranger  for 
the fatherless  and for the widow  
21when thou gatherest the grapes of 
thy vineyard  thou shalt not glean it 
after thee  it shall be for the stranger  
for the fatherless  and for the widow  
22and thou shalt remember that thou 
wast a bondman in the land of egypt  
therefore i command thee to do this 
thing   
if there be a controversy 
between men  and they come 
unto judgment  and the judges judge 
them  by justifying the righteou s and 
condemning the wicked  2then it shall 
be if the wicked man deserve to be 
beaten  that the judge shall cause him 
to lie down  and to be beaten before 
his face  according to the measure of 
his wickedness  by number  3forty 
stripes he may give him  he shall not 
exceed  lest if he should exceed  and 
beat him above these with many 
stripes  then thy brother should be 
dishonoured before thine eyes   
4thou shalt not muzzle the ox when 
he treadeth out the corn   
5if brethren dwell together  and one 
of them die and have no child  the 
wife of the dead shall not be married 
abroad unto one not of his kin  her 
husband s brother shall go in unto her  
and take her to him to wife  and 
perform the duty of a husband s 
brother unto her  6and it shall be  that 25 deuteronomy  
287 
 the firs tborn that she beareth shall 
succeed in the name of his brother that 
is dead  that his name be not blotted 
out of israel  7and if the man like not 
to take his brother s wife  then his 
brother s wife shall go up to the gate 
unto the elders  and say  my 
husband s brother refuseth to raise up 
unto his brother a name in israel  he 
will not perform the duty of a 
husband s brother unto me  8then the 
elders of his city shall call him  and 
speak unto him  and if he stand  and 
say i like not to take her  9then shall 
his brother s wife draw nigh unto him 
in the presence of the elders  and loose 
his shoe from off his foot  and spit in 
his face  and she shall answer and say  
so shall it be done unto the man that 
doth not build up his brother s house  
10and his n ame shall be called in israel 
the house of him that had his shoe 
loosed   
11when men strive together one with 
another  and the wife of the one 
draweth near to deliver her husband 
out of the hand of him that smiteth 
him and putteth forth her hand  and 
taketh him by the secrets  12then thou 
shalt cut off her hand  thine eye shall 
have no pity   
13thou shalt not have in thy bag 
diverse weights  a great and a small  
14thou shalt not have in thy house 
diverse measures  a great and a small  
15a perfect and just weight shalt thou 
have  a perfect and just measure shalt 
thou have  that thy days may be long 
upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee  16for all that do such 
things  even all that do unrighteously  
are an abomination unto the lord thy 
god  
17reme mber what amalek did unto 
thee by the way as ye came forth out 
of egypt  18how he met thee by the 
way and smote the hindmost of thee  
all that were enfeebled in thy rear  
when thou wast faint and weary  and 
he feared not god  19therefore it shall 
be when  the lord thy god hath given 
thee rest from all thine enemies round 
about  in the land which the lord thy 
god giveth thee for an inheritance to 
possess it  that thou shalt blot out the 
remembrance of amalek from under 
heaven  thou shalt not forget   
 
   
and it shall be  when thou art 
come in unto the land which 
the lord thy god giveth thee for an 
inheritance  and dost possess it  and 
dwell therein  2that thou shalt take of 
the first of all the fruit of the ground  
which thou shalt bring in from  thy land 
that the lord thy god giveth thee  and 
thou shalt put it in a basket and shalt 
go unto the place which the lord thy 
god shall choose to cause his name to

affliction  and our toil  and our 
oppression  8and the lord brought us

and with an outstretched  arm and with 
great terribleness  and with signs  and

us into this place  and hath given us 
this land  a land flowing with milk and 
honey  10and now  behold  i have

oppressed and crushed away  34so that 
thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine 
eyes which thou shalt see  35the lord 
will smite thee in the knees  and in the 
legs with a sore boil  whereof thou 
canst not be healed  from the sole of 
thy foot unto the crown of thy head  
36the lord will bring thee  and thy 
king whom thou shalt set over thee  
unto a nation that th ou hast not known  
thou nor thy fathers  and there shalt 
thou serve other gods  wood and stone  
37and thou shalt become an 
astonishment  a proverb  and a 
byword  among all the peoples whither 
the lord shall lead thee away   
38thou shalt carry much seed out  
into the field  and shalt gather little in

tail 45and all these curses shall come upon thee  and shall pursue thee  and 
overtake thee  till thou be destroyed  
because thou didst not hearken unto 
the voice of the lord thy god  to keep 
his commandments and his statutes 
which he commanded thee  46and 
they sha ll be upon thee for a sign and 
for a wonder  and upon thy seed for 
ever 47because thou didst not serve the 
lord thy god with joyfulness  and 
with gladness of heart  by reason of 
the abundance of all things  48therefore 
shalt thou serve thine enemy whom th e 
lord shall send against thee  in 
hunger  and in thirst  and in nakedness  
and in want of all things  and he shall 
put a yoke of iron upon thy neck  until 
he have destroyed thee   
49the lord will bring a nation 
against thee from far  from the end of 
the e arth as the vulture swoopeth 
down  a nation whose tongue thou 
shalt not understand  50a nation of 
fierce countenance  that shall not 
regard the person of the old  nor show 
favour to the young  51and he shall eat

caused thee to perish  52and he shall 
besiege thee in all thy gates  until thy 
high and fortified wall s come down  
wherein thou didst trust  throughout all 
thy land  and he shall besiege thee in 
all thy gates throughout all thy land  
which the lord thy god hath given 
thee 53and thou shalt eat the fruit of deuteronomy  
293 
 thine own body  the flesh of thy sons 
and of thy d aughters whom the lord 
thy god hath given thee  in the siege 
and in the straitness  wherewith thine 
enemies shall straiten thee  54the man 
that is tender among you  and very 
delicate  his eye shall be evil against 
his brother  and against the wife of his 
bosom  and against the remnant of his 
children whom he hath remaining  55so 
that he will not give to any of them of 
the flesh of his children whom he shall 
eat because he hath nothing left him  
in the siege and in the straitness  
wherewith thine enemy shal l straiten 
thee in all thy gates  56the tender and 
delicate woman among you  who 
would not adventure to set the sole of 
her foot upon the ground for 
delicateness and tenderness  her eye 
shall be evil against the husband of her 
bosom  and against her son  and 
against her daughter  57and against her 
afterbirth that cometh out from 
between her feet  and against her 
children whom she shall bear  for she 
shall eat them for want of all things 
secretly  in the siege and in the 
straitness  wherewith thine enemy 
shall straiten thee in thy gates   
58if thou wilt not observe to do all 
the words of this law that are written 
in this book  that thou mayest fear this 
glorious and awful name  the lord thy 
god 59then the lord will make thy 
plagues wonderful  and the plagues  of 
thy seed  even great plagues  and of 
long continuance  and sore sicknesses  
and of long continuance  60and he will bring back upon thee all the 
diseases of egypt  which thou wast in 
dread of  and they shall cleave unto 
thee 61also every sickness  and every 
plague  which is not written in the 
book of this law  them will the lord 
bring upon thee  until thou be 
destroyed  62and ye shall be left few in 
number  whereas ye were as the stars 
of heaven for multitude  because thou 
didst not hearken unto the voi ce of the 
lord thy god  63and it shall come to 
pass that as the lord rejoiced over 
you to do you good  and to multiply 
you so the lord will rejoice over you 
to cause you to perish  and to destroy 
you and ye shall be plucked from off 
the land whither tho u goest in to 
possess it  64and the lord shall scatter 
thee among all peoples  from the one 
end of the earth even unto the other 
end of the earth  and there thou shalt 
serve other gods  which thou hast not 
known  thou nor thy fathers  even 
wood and stone  65and among these 
nations shalt thou have no repose  and 
there shall be no rest for the sole of thy 
foot but the lord shall give thee there 
a trembling heart  and failing of eyes  
and languishing of soul  66and thy life 
shall hang in doubt before thee  and 
thou shalt fear night and day  and shalt 
have no assurance of thy life  67in the 
morning thou shalt say  would it 
were even   and at even thou shalt 
say would it were morning   for the 
fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear  
and for the sight of th ine eyes which 
thou shalt see  68and the lord shall deuteronomy  
294 
 bring thee back into egypt in ships  by 
the way whereof i said unto thee  
thou shalt see it no more again  and 
there ye shall sell yourselves unto your 
enemies for bondmen and for 
bondwoman  and no man shall buy 
you  
69these are the words of the 
covenant which the lord commanded 
moses to make with the children of 
israel in the land of moab  beside the 
covenant which he made with them in 
horeb   
and moses called unto all 
israel  and said unto them   
ye have seen all that the lord did 
before your eyes in the land of egypt 
unto pharaoh  and unto all his 
servants  and unto all his land  2the 
great trials which thine eyes saw  the 
signs and those great wonders  3but the 
lord hath not given you a heart to 
know and eyes to see  and ears to 
hear unto this day  4and i have led 
you forty years in the wilderness  your 
clothes are not waxen old upon you  
and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy 
foot 5ye have not eaten bread  neither 
have ye drunk wine or strong d rink 
that ye might know that i am the lord 
your god  6and when ye came unto 
this place  sihon the king of heshbon  
and og the king of bashan  came out 
against us unto battle  and we smote 
them  7and we took their land  and 
gave it for an inheritance unto the 
reubenites  and to the gadites  and to 
the half tribe of the manassites  
8observe therefore the words of this covenant  and do them  that ye may 
make all that ye do to prosper   
  
9ye are standing this day all of you 
before the lord your god  your heads  
your tribes  your elders  and your 
officers  even all the men of israel  
10your little ones  your wives  and thy 
stranger that is in the midst of thy 
camp  from the hewer of t hy wood 
unto the drawer of thy water  11that 
thou shouldest enter into the covenant 
of the lord thy god and into his 
oathwhich the lord thy god maketh 
with thee this day  12that he may 
establish thee this day unto himself 
for a people  and that he may be unto 
thee a god  as he spoke unto thee  and 
as he swore unto thy fathers  to 
abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  
13neither with you only do i make this 
covenant and this oath  14but with him 
that standeth here with us this day 
before the lord our god  and als o with 
him that is not here with us this day 
15 for ye know how we dwelt in the 
land of egypt  and how we came 
through the midst of the nations 
through which ye passed  16and ye 
have seen their detestable things  and 
their idols  wood and stone  silver and  
gold which were with them 17lest 
there should be among you man  or 
woman  or family  or tribe  whose 
heart turneth away this day from the 
lord our god  to go to serve the gods 
of those nations  lest there should be 
among you a root that beareth gall and 
wormwood  18 and it come to pass  29 deuteronomy  
295 
 when he heareth the words of this 
curse  that he bless himself in his 
heart  saying  i shall have peace  
though i walk in the stubbornness of 
my heart that the watered be swept 
away with the dry  19the lord will not 
be w illing to pardon him  but then the 
anger of the lord and his jealousy 
shall be kindled against that man  and 
all the curse that is written in this book 
shall lie upon him  and the lord shall 
blot out his name from under heaven  
20and the lord shall separat e him unto 
evil out of all the tribes of israel  
according to all the curses of the 
covenant that is written in this book of 
the law  21and the generation to come  
your children that shall rise up after 
you and the foreigner that shall come 
from a far lan d shall say  when they 
see the plagues of that land  and the 
sicknesses wherewith the lord hath 
made it sick  22and that the whole land 
thereof is brimstone  and salt  and a 
burning  that it is not sown  nor 
beareth  nor any grass groweth therein  
like th e overthrow of sodom and 
gomorrah  admah and zeboiim  
which the lord overthrew in his 
anger  and in his wrath  23even all the 
nations shall say wherefore hath the 
lord done thus unto this land  what 
meaneth the heat of this great anger  
24then men shall say because they 
forsook the covenant of the lord the 
god of their fathers  which he made 
with them when he brought them forth 
out of the land of egypt  25and went 
and served other gods  and worshipped them  gods that they knew not  and 
that he had not allotted unto them  
26therefore the anger of the lord was 
kindled against this land  to bring upon 
it all the curse that is written in this 
book  27and the lord rooted them out 
of their land in anger  and in wrath  
and in great indignation  and cast them 
into another land  as it is this day  28 
the secret things belong unto the lord 
our god  but the things that are 
revealed belong unto us and to our 
children for ever  that we may do all 
the words of this law   
and it shall come to pass  
when all these things are come 
upon thee  the blessing and the curse  
which i have set before thee  and thou 
shalt bethink thyself among all the 
nations  whither the lord thy god hath 
driven thee  2and shalt return unto the 
lord thy god  and hearken to his 
voice accordin g to all that i command 
thee this day  thou and thy children  
with all thy heart  and with all thy 
soul 3that then the lord thy god will 
turn thy captivity  and have 
compassion upon thee  and will return 
and gather thee from all the peoples  
whither the lord thy god hath 
scattered thee  4if any of thine that are 
dispersed be in the uttermost parts of 
heaven  from thence will the lord thy 
god gather thee  and from thence will 
he fetch thee  5and the lord thy god 
will bring thee into the land which thy 
fathe rs possessed  and thou shalt 
possess it  and he will do thee good  
and multiply thee above thy fathers  30 deuteronomy  
296 
 6and the lord thy god will circumcise 
thy heart  and the heart of thy seed  to 
love the lord thy god with all thy 
heart  and with all thy soul  that tho u 
mayest live  7and the lord thy god 
will put all these curses upon thine 
enemies  and on them that hate thee  
that persecuted thee  8and thou shalt 
return and hearken to the voice of the 
lord and do all his commandments 
which i command thee this day  9and 
the lord thy god will make thee over 
abundant in all the work of thy hand  
in the fruit of thy body  and in the fruit 
of thy cattle  and in the fruit of thy 
land for good  for the lord will again 
rejoice over thee for good  as he 
rejoiced over thy fathe rs 10if thou shalt 
hearken to the voice of the lord thy 
god to keep his commandments and 
his statutes which are written in this 
book of the law  if thou turn unto the 
lord thy god with all thy heart  and 
with all thy soul   
11for this commandment which i  
command thee this day  it is not too 
hard for thee  neither is it far off  12it is 
not in heaven  that thou shouldest say  
who shall go up for us to heaven  and 
bring it unto us  and make us to hear it  
that we may do it  13neither is it 
beyond the sea  that thou shouldest 
say who shall go over the sea for us  
and bring it unto us  and make us to 
hear it  that we may do it  14but the 
word is very nigh unto thee  in thy 
mouth  and in thy heart  that thou 
mayest do it   15see i have set before thee thi s day 
life and good  and death and evil  16in 
that i command thee this day to love 
the lord thy god  to walk in his ways  
and to keep his commandments and 
his statutes and his ordinances  then 
thou shalt live and multiply  and the 
lord thy god shall bless thee in the 
land whither thou goest in to possess 
it 17but if thy heart turn away  and 
thou wilt not hear  but shalt be drawn 
away  and worship other gods  and 
serve them  18i declare unto you this 
day that ye shall surely perish  ye 
shall not prolong yo ur days upon the 
land whither thou passest over the 
jordan to go in to possess it  19i call 
heaven and earth to witness against 
you this day  that i have set before thee 
life and death  the blessing and the 
curse  therefore choose life  that thou 
mayest l ive thou and thy seed  20to 
love the lord thy god  to hearken to 
his voice  and to cleave unto him  for 
that is thy life  and the length of thy 
days that thou mayest dwell in the 
land which the lord swore unto thy 
fathers  to abraham  to isaac  and to 
jacob to give them   
 
 
and moses went and spoke 
these words unto all israel  
2and he said unto them  i am a 
hundred and twenty years old this day  
i can no more go out and come in  and 
the lord hath said unto me  thou shalt 
not go over this jordan  3the lord thy 
god he will go over before thee  he 31 deuteronomy  
297 
 will destroy these nations from before 
thee and thou shalt dispossess them  
and joshua  he shall go over before 
thee as the lord hath spoken  4and 
the lord will do unto them as he did 
to sihon and to og  the kings of the 
amo rites and unto their land  whom 
he destroyed  5and the lord will 
deliver them up before you  and ye 
shall do unto them according unto all 
the commandment which i have 
commanded you  6be strong and of 
good courage  fear not  nor be 
affrighted at them  for the lord thy 
god he it is that doth go with thee  
he will not fail thee  nor forsake thee   
7and moses called unto joshua  and 
said unto him in the sight of all israel  
be strong and of good courage  for 
thou shalt go with this people into the 
land whic h the lord hath sworn unto 
their fathers to give them  and thou 
shalt cause them to inherit it  8and the 
lord he it is that doth go before thee  
he will be with thee  he will not fail 
thee neither forsake thee  fear not  
neither be dismayed   
9and moses  wrote this law  and 
delivered it unto the priests the sons of 
levi that bore the ark of the covenant 
of the lord and unto all the elders of 
israel  10and moses commanded them  
saying  at the end of every seven 
years  in the set time of the year of 
release in the feast of tabernacles  
11when all israel is come to appear 
before the lord thy god in the place 
which he shall choose  thou shalt read 
this law before all israel in their hearing  12assemble the people  the 
men and the women and the little ones  
and thy stranger that is within thy 
gates  that they may hear  and that they 
may learn  and fear the lord your 
god and observe to do all the words 
of this law  13and that their children  
who have not known  may hear  and 
learn to fear the lord your god  as 
long as ye live in the land whither ye 
go over the jordan to possess it   
14and the lord said unto moses  
behold  thy days approach that thou 
must die  call joshua  and present 
yourselves in the tent of meeting  that i 
may give him a charge  and mose s 
and joshua went  and presented 
themselves in the tent of meeting  
15and the lord appeared in the tent in 
a pillar of cloud  and the pillar of 
cloud stood over the door of the tent  
16and the lord said unto moses  
behold  thou art about to sleep with 
thy fathers  and this people will rise 
up and go astray after the foreign gods 
of the land  whither they go to be 
among them  and will forsake me  and 
break my covenant which i have made 
with them  17then my anger shall be 
kindled against them in that day  and i 
will forsake them  and i will hide my 
face from them  and they shall be 
devoured  and many evils and troubles 
shall come upon them  so that they 
will say in that day  are not these evils 
come upon us because our god is not 
among us  18and i will surel y hide my 
face in that day for all the evil which 
they shall have wrought  in that they deuteronomy  
298 
 are turned unto other gods  19now 
therefore write ye this song for you  
and teach thou it the children of israel  
put it in their mouths  that this song 
may be a witnes s for me against the 
children of israel  20for when i shall 
have brought them into the land which 
i swore unto their fathers  flowing with 
milk and honey  and they shall have 
eaten their fill  and waxen fat  and 
turned unto other gods  and served 
them  and despised me  and broken 
my covenant  21then it shall come to 
pass when many evils and troubles are 
come upon them  that this song shall 
testify before them as a witness  for it 
shall not be forgotten out of the 
mouths of their seed  for i know their 
imag ination how they do even now  
before i have brought them into the 
land which i swore  22so moses wrote 
this song the same day  and taught it 
the children of israel  23and he gave 
joshua the son of nun a charge  and 
said be strong and of good courage  
for thou shalt bring the children of 
israel into the land which i swore unto 
them  and i will be with thee   
24and it came to pass  when moses 
had made an end of writing the words 
of this law in a book  until they were 
finished  25that moses commanded the 
levites  that bore the ark of the 
covenant of the lord saying  26take 
this book of the law  and put it by the 
side of the ark of the covenant of the 
lord your god  that it may be there 
for a witness against thee  27for i know 
thy rebellion  and thy stiff neck  behold  while i am yet alive with you 
this day  ye have been rebellious 
against the lord and how much more 
after my death  28assemble unto me 
all the elders of your tribes  and your 
officers  that i may speak these words 
in their ears  and call heav en and earth 
to witness against them  29for i know 
that after my death ye will in any wise 
deal corruptly  and turn aside from the 
way which i have commanded you  
and evil will befall you in the end of 
days because ye will do that which is 
evil in the sig ht of the lord to 
provoke him through the work of your 
hands  30and moses spoke in the ears 
of all the assembly of israel the words 
of this song  until they were finished   
 
  
give ear  ye heavens  and i 
 will speak   
and let the earth hear the words of 
my mouth   
2my doctrine shall drop as the rain   
my speech shall distil as the dew   
as the small rain upon the tender 
grass   
and as the showers upon the herb   
3for i  will proclaim the name of the 
lord  
ascribe ye greatness unto our god   
 
4the rock  his work is perfect   
for all his ways are justice   
a god of faithfulness and without 
iniquity   
just and right is he   32 deuteronomy  
299 
 5is corruption his  no his 
children s is the ble mish   
a generation crooked and perverse   
6do ye thus requite the lord  
o foolish people and unwise   
is not he thy father that hath gotten 
thee  
hath he not made thee  and 
established thee   
 
7remember the days of old   
consider the years of many 
gener ations   
ask thy father  and he will declare 
unto thee   
thine elders  and they will tell thee   
8when the most high gave to the 
nations  
when he separated the children of 
men  
he set the borders of the peoples  
according to the number of the 
children of israel   
9for the portion of the lord is his 
people   
jacob the lot of his inheritance   
 
10he found him in a desert land   
and in the waste  a howling 
wilderness   
he compassed him about  he cared 
for him   
he kept him as the apple of his eye   
11as an ea gle that stirreth up her 
nest  
hovereth over her young   
spreadeth abroad her wings  taketh 
them   
beareth them on her pinions  12the lord alone did lead him   
and there was no strange god with 
him  
 
13he made him ride on the high 
places of the earth   
and he did eat the fruitage of the 
field  
and he made him to suck honey out 
of the crag   
and oil out of the flinty rock   
14curd of kine  and milk of sheep   
with fat of lambs   
and rams of the breed of bashan  
and he goats   
with the kidney fat of wheat   
and of the blood of the grape thou 
drankest foaming wine   
 
15but jeshurun waxed fat  and 
kicked  
thou didst wax fat  thou didst grow 
thick  thou didst become gross  
and he forsook god who made him   
and contemned the rock of his 
salvation   
16they rouse d him to jealousy with 
strange gods   
with abominations did they provoke 
him  
17they sacrificed unto demons  no
gods   
gods that they knew not   
new gods that came up of late   
which your fathers dreaded not   
18of the rock that begot thee thou 
wast unmin dful  
and didst forget god that bore thee   
 deuteronomy  
300 
 19and the lord saw and spurned   
because of the provoking of his 
sons and  
his daughters   
20and he said  i will hide my face 
from them   
i will see what their end shall be   
for they are a very froward 
gener ation  
children in whom is no faithfulness  
21they have roused me to jealousy 
with a no god  
they have provoked me with their 
vanities   
and i will rouse them to jealousy 
with a no people   
i will provoke them with a vile 
nation  22for a fire is kindled i n 
my nostril   
and burneth unto the depths of the 
nether world   
and devoureth the earth with her 
produce  
and setteth ablaze the foundations 
of the mountains   
 
23i will heap evils upon them   
i will spend mine arrows upon 
them   
24the wasting of hunger  and the  
 devouring of the fiery bolt   
and bitter destruction   
and the teeth of beasts will i send 
upon them   
with the venom of crawling things 
of the  dust  
25without shall the sword bereave   
and in the chambers terror   
slaying both young man and vir gin  the suckling with the man of gray 
hairs   
 
26i thought i would make an end of 
them   
i would make their memory cease 
from among men   
27were it not that i dreaded the 
enemy s provocation   
lest their adversaries should 
misdeem   
lest they should say  our hand is 
exalted   
and not the lord hath wrought all 
this  
 
28for they are a nation void of 
counsel   
and there is no understanding in 
them   
29if they were wise  they would 
understand this   
they would discern their latter end   
30how should one cha se a thousand   
and two put ten thousand to flight   
except their rock had given them 
over  
and the lord had delivered them 
up  
31for their rock is not as our rock   
even our enemies themselves being  
 judges   
32for their vine is of the vine of 
sodom  
and of the fields of gomorrah   
their grapes are grapes of gall   
their clusters are bitter   
33their wine is the venom of 
serpents   deuteronomy  
301 
 and the cruel poison of asps   
 
34is not this laid up in store with 
me  
sealed up in my treasuries   
35vengeance is mine  and 
recompense   
against the time when their foot 
shall slip   
for the day of their calamity is at 
hand   
and the things that are to come 
upon them shall make haste   
 
36for the lord will judge his 
people   
and repent himself for his 
servants   
when he see th that their stay is 
gone   
and there is none remaining  shut 
up or left at large   
37and it is said  where are their 
gods   
the rock in whom they trusted   
38who did eat the fat of their 
sacrifices   
and drank the wine of their drink  
 offering   
let him  rise up and help you   
let him be your protection   
 
39see now that i  even i  am he   
and there is no god with me   
i kill  and i make alive   
i have wounded  and i heal   
and there is none that can deliver 
out of my hand   
40for i lift up my hand to hea ven  and say  as i live for ever   
41if i whet my glittering sword   
and my hand take hold on 
judgment   
i will render vengeance to mine  
 adversaries   
and will recompense them that hate 
me  
42i will make mine arrows drunk 
with blood   
and my sword shal l devour flesh   
with the blood of the slain and the 
captives   
from the long haired heads of the 
enemy   
 
43sing aloud  o ye nations  of his 
people   
for he doth avenge the blood of his 
servants   
and doth render vengeance to his   
 adversaries   
and doth  make expiation for the 
land of his people   
 
44and moses came and spoke all the 
words of this song in the ears of the 
people  he and hoshea the son of 
nun 45and when moses made an end 
of speaking all these words to all 
israel  46he said unto them  set your 
heart unto all the words wherewith i 
testify against you this day  that ye 
may charge your children therewith to 
observe to do all the words of this law  
47for it is no vain thing for you  
because it is your life  and through this 
thing ye shall prolo ng your days upon deuteronomy  
302 
 the land  whither ye go over the jordan 
to possess it   
48and the lord spoke unto moses 
that selfsame day  saying  49get thee 
up into this mountain of abarim  unto 
mount nebo  which is in the land of 
moab  that is over against jericho  and 
behold the land of canaan  which i 
give unto the children of israel for a 
possession  50and die in the mount 
whither thou goest up  and be gathered 
unto thy people  as aaron thy brother 
died in mount hor  and was gathered 
unto his people  51because ye 
trespassed against me in the midst of 
the children of israel at the waters of 
meribath kadesh  in the wilderness of 
zin because ye sanctified me not in 
the midst of the children of israel  
52for thou shalt see the land afar off  
but thou shalt not go thit her into the 
land which i give the children of 
israel   
   
and this is the blessing 
wherewith moses the man of 
god blessed the children of israel 
before his death  2and he said   
the lord came from sinai   
and rose from seir unto them   
he shin ed forth from mount paran   
and he came from the myriads 
holy  
at his right hand was a fiery law 
unto  them   
3yea he loveth the peoples   
all his holy ones they are in thy 
hand   
and they sit down at thy feet   receiving of thy words   
4moses commanded us a law   
an inheritance of the congregation 
of  
jacob   
5and there was a king in jeshurun   
when the heads of the people were 
gathered   
all the tribes of israel together   
 
6let reuben live  and not die  
in that his men become few   
 
7and this for judah  and he said   
hear  lord the voice of judah   
and bring him in unto his people   
his hands shall contend for him   
and thou shalt be a help against his  
 adversaries   
 
8and of levi he said   
thy thummim and thy urim be 
with thy holy one   
whom thou did st prove at massah   
with whom thou didst strive at the 
waters  of meribah   
9who said of his father  and of his 
mother  i have not seen him   
neither did he acknowledge his 
brethren   
nor knew he his own children   
for they have observed thy word   
and keep thy covenant   
10they shall teach jacob thine 
ordinances   
and israel thy law   
they shall put incense before thee   
and whole burnt offering upon 
thine altar   33 deuteronomy  
303 
 11bless  lord his substance   
and accept the work of his hands   
smite through the loins o f them that 
rise up against him   
and of them that hate him  that they 
rise not again   
 
12of benjamin he said   
the beloved of the lord shall dwell 
in safety by him   
he covereth him all the day   
and he dwelleth between his 
shoulders   
 
13and of joseph h e said   
blessed of the lord be his land   
for the precious things of heaven  
for the dew   
and for the deep that coucheth 
beneath   
14and for the precious things of the 
fruits of the sun   
and for the precious things of the 
yield of  the moons   
15and for the tops of the ancient  
 mountains   
and for the precious things of the 
everlasting hills   
16and for the precious things of the 
earth and the fulness thereof   
and the good will of him that dwelt 
in the bush   
let the blessing come upon the head 
of  
joseph  
and upon the crown of the head of 
him that is prince among his 
brethren   17his firstling bullock  majesty is 
his  
and his horns are the horns of the 
wildox  
with them he shall gore the peoples 
all of them  even the ends of the 
earth   
and they are  the ten thousands of 
ephraim   
and they are the thousands of 
manasseh  
 
18and of zebulun he said   
rejoice  zebulun  in thy going out   
and issachar  in thy tents   
19they shall call peoples unto the 
mountain   
there shall they offer sacrifices of 
righte ousness   
for they shall suck the abundance of 
the seas   
and the hidden treasures of the 
sand  
 
20and of gad he said   
blessed be he that enlargeth gad   
he dwelleth as a lioness   
and teareth the arm  yea the crown 
of the head   
21and he chose a first part for 
himself   
for there a portion of a ruler was 
reserved   
and there came the heads of the 
people   
he executed the righteousness of the 
lord  
and his ordinances with israel   
 deuteronomy  
304 
 22and of dan he said   
dan is a lion s whelp   
that leapeth forth from b ashan   
 
23and of naphtali he said   
o naphtali  satisfied with favour   
and full with the blessing of the 
lord  
possess thou the sea and the south   
 
24and of asher he said   
blessed be asher above sons   
let him be the favoured of his 
brethren   
and let  him dip his foot in oil   
25iron and brass shall be thy bars   
and as thy days  so shall thy 
strength be   
 
26there is none like unto god  o 
jeshurun   
who rideth upon the heaven as thy 
help  
and in his excellency on the skies   
27the eternal god is a dw elling 
place   
and underneath are the everlasting 
arms   
and he thrust out the enemy from 
before thee   
and said  destroy   
28and israel dwelleth in safety   
the fountain of jacob alone   
in a land of corn and wine   
yea his heavens drop down dew   
29happy art thou  o israel  who is 
like unto thee   
a people saved by the lord  
the shield of thy help   and that is the sword of thy 
excellency   
and thine enemies shall dwindle 
away before thee   
and thou shalt tread upon their high 
places   
 
and moses w ent up from the 
plains of moab unto mount 
nebo  to the top of pisgah  that is over 
against jericho  and the lord showed 
him all the land  even gilead as far as 
dan 2and all naphtali  and the land of 
ephraim and manasseh  and all the 
land of judah as far a s the hinder sea  
3and the south  and the plain  even the 
valley of jericho the city of palm trees  
as far as zoar  4and the lord said unto 
him this is the land which i swore 
unto abraham  unto isaac  and unto 
jacob  saying  i will give it unto thy 
seed i have caused thee to see it with 
thine eyes  but thou shalt not go over 
thither  5so moses the servant of the 
lord died there in the land of moab  
according to the word of the lord 
6and he was buried in the valley in the 
land of moab over against beth peor 
and no man knoweth of his sepulchre 
unto this day  7and moses was a 
hundred and twenty years old when he 
died his eye was not dim  nor his 
natural force abated  8and the children 
of israel wept for moses in the plains 
of moab thirty days  so the day s of 
weeping in the mourning for moses 
were ended  9and joshua the son of 
nun was full of the spirit of wisdom  
for moses had laid his hands upon 34 deuteronomy  
305 
 him and the children of israel 
hearkened unto him  and did as the 
lord commanded moses  10and there 
hath not arisen a prophet since in israel 
like unto moses  whom the lord knew 
face to face  11in all the signs and the wonders  which the lord sent him to 
do in the land of egypt  to pharaoh  
and to all his servants  and to all his 
land 12and in all the mighty han d and 
in all the great terror  which moses 
wrought in the sight of all israel

joshua  
 
now it came to pass after the 
death of moses the servant of the 
lord that the lord spoke unto joshua 
the son of nun  moses minister  
saying  2moses my servant is dead  
now therefore a rise go over this 
jordan  thou and all this people  unto 
the land which i do give to them  even 
to the children of israel  3every place 
that the sole of your foot shall tread 
upon  to you have i given it  as i spoke 
unto moses  4from the wilderness  and 
this lebanon  even unto the great 
river  the river euphrates  all the land 
of the hittites  and unto the great sea 
toward the going down of the sun  
shall be your border  5there shall not 
any man be able to stand before thee 
all the days of thy life  as i was with 
moses  so i will be with thee  i will 
not fail thee  nor forsake thee  6be 
strong and of good courage  for thou 
shalt cause this people to inherit the 
land which i swore unto their fathers 
to give them  7only be strong and very 
courageous  to obse rve to do according 
to all the law  which moses my 
servant commanded thee  turn not 
from it to the right hand or to the left  
that thou mayest have good success 
whithersoever thou goest  8this book 
of the law shall not depart out of thy 
mouth  but thou sha lt meditate therein 
day and night  that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is 
written therein  for then thou shalt 
make thy ways prosperous  and then 
thou shalt have good success  9have 
not i commanded thee  be strong and 
of good courage  be n ot affrighted  
neither be thou dismayed  for the lord 
thy god is with thee whithersoever 
thou goest   
10then joshua commanded the 
officers of the people  saying  11pass 
through the midst of the camp  and 
command the people  saying  prepare 
you victuals  for within three days ye 
are to pass over this jordan  to go in to 
possess the land  which the lord your 
god giveth you to possess it   
12and to the reubenites  and to the 
gadites  and to the half tribe of 
manasseh  spoke joshua  saying  
13remember the w ord which moses 
the servant of the lord commanded  
you saying  the lord your god 
giveth you rest  and will give you this 
land 14your wives  your little ones  
and your cattle  shall abide in the land 
which moses gave you beyond the 
jordan  but ye shall pa ss over before 
your brethren armed  all the mighty 
men of valour  and shall help them  
15until the lord have given your 
brethren rest  as unto you  and they 
also have possessed the land which the 
lord your god giveth them  then ye 1 joshua  
308 
 shall return unto the lan d of your 
possession  and possess it  which 
moses the servant of the lord gave 
you beyond the jordan toward the 
sunrising   
16and they answered joshua  saying  
all that thou hast commanded us we 
will do  and whithersoever thou 
sendest us we will go  17according as 
we hearkened unto moses in all things  
so will we hearken unto thee  only the 
lord thy god be with thee  as he was 
with moses  18whosoever he be that 
shall rebel against thy commandment  
and shall not hearken unto thy words 
in all that thou comm andest him  he 
shall be put to death  only be strong 
and of good courage   
and joshua the son of nun sent 
out of shittim two spies secretly  
saying  go view the land  and 
jericho  and they went  and came 
into the house of a harlot whose name 
was rahab  and lay there  2and it was 
told the king of jericho  saying  
behold  there came men in hither to 
night of the children of israel to search 
out the land  3and the king of jericho 
sent unto rahab  saying  bring forth 
the men that are come to thee  that are 
entered into thy house  for they are 
come to search out all the land  4and 
the woman took the two men  and hid 
them  and she said  yea the men 
came unto me  but i knew not whence 
they were  5and it came to pass about 
the time of the shutting of the gate 
when it was dark  that the men went 
out whither the men went i know not  pursue after them quickly  for ye shall 
overtake them  6but she had brought 
them up to the roof  and hid them with 
the stalks of flax  which she had 
spread out upon the roof  7and the 
men pursued after them the way to the 
jordan unto the fords  and as soon as 
they that pursued after them were gone 
out the gate was shut  8and before 
they were laid down  she came up unto 
them upon the roof  9and she said unto 
the men  i know th at the lord hath 
given you the land  and that your terror 
is fallen upon us  and that all the 
inhabitants of the land melt away 
before you  10for we have heard how 
the lord dried up the water of the red 
sea before you  when ye came out of 
egypt  and what y e did unto the two 
kings of the amorites  that were 
beyond the jordan  unto sihon and to 
og whom ye utterly destroyed  11and 
as soon as we had heard it  our hearts 
did melt  neither did there remain any 
more spirit in any man  because of 
you for the lord your god  he is god 
in heaven above  and on earth beneath  
12now therefore  i pray you  swear 
unto me by the lord since i have 
dealt kindly with you  that ye also will 
deal kindly with my father s house 
and give me a true token 13and save 
alive my father  and my mother  and 
my brethren  and my sisters  and all 
that they have  and deliver our lives 
from death  14and the men said unto 
her our life for yours  if ye tell not 
this our business  and it shall be  when 
the lord giveth us the land  that we 2 joshua  
309 
 will deal kindly and truly with thee  
15then she let them down by a cord 
through the window  for her house was 
upon the side of the wall  and she 
dwelt upon the wall  16and she said 
unto them  get you to the mountain  
lest the pursuers light upon you  and 
hide yourselves there three days  until 
the pursuers be returned  and afterward 
may ye go your way  17and the men 
said unto her  we will be guiltless of 
this thine oath which thou hast made 
us to swear  18behold  when we come 
into the land  thou shalt bind  this line 
of scarlet thread in the window which 
thou didst let us down by  and thou 
shalt gather unto thee into the house 
thy father  and thy mother  and thy 
brethren  and all thy father s 
household  19and it shall be  that 
whosoever shall go out of the d oors of 
thy house into the street  his blood 
shall be upon his head  and we will be 
guiltless  and whosoever shall be with 
thee in the house  his blood shall be on 
our head  if any hand be upon him  
20but if thou utter this our business  
then we will be gu iltless of thine oath 
which thou hast made us to swear  
21and she said  according unto your 
words  so be it  and she sent them 
away  and they departed  and she 
bound the scarlet line in the window  
22and they went  and came unto the 
mountain  and abode there three days  
until the pursuers were returned  and 
the pursuers sought them throughout 
all the way  but found them not  
23then the two men returned  and descended from the mountain  and 
passed over  and came to joshua the 
son of nun  and they told him  all that 
had befallen them  24and they said 
unto joshua  truly the lord hath 
delivered into our hands all the land  
and moreover all the inhabitants of the 
land do melt away before us   
and joshua rose up early in the 
morning  and they removed from 
shittim  and came to the jordan  he 
and all the children of israel  and they 
lodged there before they passed over  
2and it came to pass after three days  
that the officers went through the 
midst of the camp  3and they 
commanded the people  saying  when 
ye see the ark of the covenant of the 
lord your god  and the priests the 
levites bearing it  then ye shall 
remove from your place  and go after 
it 4yet there shall be a space between 
you and it  about two thousand cubits 
by measure  come not near unto it  that 
ye may know the way by which ye 
must go  for ye have not passed this 
way heretofore   
5and joshua said unto the people  
sanctify yourselves  for to morrow 
the lord will do wonders among you  
6and joshua spoke unto the priests  
saying  take up the ark  of the 
covenant  and pass on before the 
people  and they took up the ark of 
the covenant  and went before the 
people   
7and the lord said unto joshua  
this day will i begin to magnify thee 
in the sight of all israel  that they may 3 joshua  
310 
 know that  as i was wi th moses  so i 
will be with thee  8and thou shalt 
command the priests that bear the ark 
of the covenant  saying  when ye are 
come to the brink of the waters of the 
jordan  ye shall stand still in the 
jordan   
9and joshua said unto the children 
of israel  come hither  and hear the 
words of the lord your god  10and 
joshua said  hereby ye shall know 
that the living god is among you  and 
that he will without fail drive out from 
before you the canaanite  and the 
hittite  and the hivite  and the 
perizzite  and the girgashite  and the 
amorite  and the jebusite  11behold  
the ark of the covenant of the lord of 
all the earth passeth on before you 
over the jordan  12now therefore take 
you twelve men out of the tribes of 
israel  for every tribe a man  13and it 
shall come to pass  when the soles of 
the feet of the priests that bear the ark 
of the lord the lord of all the earth  
shall rest in the waters of the jordan  
that the waters of the jordan shall be 
cut off  even the waters that come 
down from above  and they shall stand 
in one heap  14and it came to pass  
when the people removed from their 
tents  to pass over the jordan  the 
priests that bore the ark of the 
covenant being before the people  
15and when they that bore the ark were 
come unto the jordan  and the feet of 
the priests that bore the ark were 
dipped in the brink of the water for 
the jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest 16that the waters 
which came down from above stood  
and rose up in one heap  a great way 
off from adam  the city th at is beside 
zarethan  and those that went down 
toward the sea of the arabah  even the 
salt sea  were wholly cut off  and the 
people passed over right against 
jericho  17and the priests that bore the 
ark of the covenant of the lord stood 
firm on dry ground  in the midst of the 
jordan  while all israel passed over on 
dry ground  until all the nation were 
passed clean over the jordan   
and it came to pass  when all the 
nation were clean passed over the 
jordan  that the lord spoke unto 
joshua  saying  2take you twelve men 
out of the people  out of every tribe a 
man 3and command ye them  saying  
take you hence out of the midst of the 
jordan  out of the place where the 
priests feet stood  twelve stones made 
ready  and carry them over with you  
and lay them dow n in the lodging 
place  where ye shall lodge this night   
4then joshua called the twelve men  
whom he had prepared of the children 
of israel  out of every tribe a man  5and 
joshua said unto them  pass on before 
the ark of the lord your god into the 
midst  of the jordan  and take you up 
every man of you a stone upon his 
shoulder  according unto the number 
of the tribes of the children of israel  
6that this may be a sign among you  
that when your children ask in time to 
come  saying  what mean ye by these 
stones 7then ye shall say unto them  4 joshua  
311 
 because the waters of the jordan were 
cut off before the ark of the covenant 
of the lord when it passed over the 
jordan  the waters of the jordan were 
cut off  and these stones shall be for a 
memorial unto the children of israel 
for ever  8and the children of israel 
did so as joshua commanded  and took 
up twelve stones out of the midst of 
the jordan  as the lord spoke unto 
joshua  according to the number of the 
tribes of the children of israel  and 
they carried them ove r with them unto 
the place where they lodged  and laid 
them down there  9joshua also set up 
twelve stones in the midst of the 
jordan  in the place where the feet of 
the priests that bore the ark of the 
covenant stood  and they are there 
unto this day  10and the priests that 
bore the ark stood in the midst of the 
jordan  until every thing was finished 
that the lord commanded joshua to 
speak unto the people  according to all 
that moses commanded joshua  and 
the people hastened and passed over  
11and it came t o pass  when all the 
people were clean passed over  that the 
ark of the lord passed on  and the 
priests  before the people  12and the 
children of reuben  and the children of 
gad and the half tribe of manasseh  
passed on armed before the children of 
israel  as moses spoke unto them  
13about forty thousand ready armed for 
war passed on in the presence of the 
lord unto battle  to the plains of 
jericho   14on that day the lord magnified 
joshua in the sight of all israel  and 
they feared him  as they feared mos es 
all the days of his life   
15and the lord spoke unto joshua  
saying  16command the priests that 
bear the ark of the testimony  that they 
come up out of the jordan  17joshua 
therefore commanded the priests  
saying  come ye up out of the 
jordan  18and it came to pass  as the 
priests that bore the ark of the 
covenant of the lord came up out of 
the midst of the jordan  as soon as the 
soles of the priests feet were drawn up 
unto the dry ground  that the waters of 
the jordan returned unto their place  
and went over all its banks  as 
aforetime  19and the people came up 
out of the jordan on the tenth day of 
the first month  and encamped in 
gilgal  on the east border of jericho  
20and those twelve stones  which they 
took out of the jordan  did joshua set 
up in gilgal  21and he spoke unto the 
children of israel  saying  when your 
children shall ask their fathers in time 
to come  saying  what mean these 
stones  22then ye shall let your 
children know  saying  israel came 
over this jordan on dry land  23for the 
lord your god dried up the waters of 
jordan from before you  until ye were 
passed over  as the lord your god did 
to the red sea  which he dried up 
from before us  until we were passed 
over 24that all the peoples of the earth 
may know the hand of the lord that it joshua  
312 
 is mighty  that ye may fear the lord 
your god for ever   
and it came to pass  when all the 
kings of the amorites  that were 
beyond the jordan westward  and all 
the kings of the canaanites  that were 
by the sea  heard how that the lord 
had dried up the waters of the jordan 
from before the children of israel  until 
they were passed over  that their heart 
melted  neither was there spirit in them 
any more  because of the children of 
israel   
2at that time the lord said unto 
joshua  make thee knives of flint  and 
circumcise again the children of israel 
the second time  3and joshua made 
him knives of flint  and circumcised 
the children of israel at agibeath ha
araloth  4and this is the cause why 
joshua did circumcise  all the people 
that came forth ou t of egypt  that were 
males  even all the men of war  died in 
the wilderness by the way  after they 
came forth out of egypt  5for all the 
people that came out were 
circumcised  but all the people that 
were born in the wilderness by the way 
as they came for th out of egypt  had 
not been circumcised  6for the children 
of israel walked forty years in the 
wilderness  till all the nation  even the 
men of war that came forth out of 
egypt  were consumed  because they 
hearkened not unto the voice of the 
lord unto w hom the lord swore that 
he would not let them see the land 
                                                      
a that is the hill of the foreskins  which the lord swore unto their 
fathers that he would give us  a land 
flowing with milk and honey  7and he 
raised up their children in their stead  
them did joshua circumcise  for they 
were uncircu mcised  because they had 
not been circumcised by the way  8and 
it came to pass  when all the nation 
were circumcised  every one of them  
that they abode in their places in the 
camp  till they were whole   
9and the lord said unto joshua  
this day have i ro lled away the 
reproach of egypt from off you  
wherefore the name of that place was 
called bgilgal  unto this day   
10and the children of israel 
encamped in gilgal  and they kept the 
passover on the fourteenth day of the 
month at even in the plains of jeri cho 
11and they did eat of the produce of 
the land on the morrow after the 
passover  unleavened cakes and 
parched corn  in the selfsame day  
12and the manna ceased on the 
morrow  after they had eaten of the 
produce of the land  neither had the 
children of israel manna any more  but 
they did eat of the fruit of the land of 
canaan that year   
13and it came to pass  when joshua 
was by jericho  that he lifted up his 
eyes and looked  and behold  there 
stood a man over against him with his 
sword drawn in his han d and joshua 
went unto him  and said unto him  art 
thou for us  or for our adversaries  
                                                      
b that is rolling  5 joshua  
313 
 14and he said  nay but i am captain 
of the host of the lord i am now 
come  and joshua fell on his face to 
the earth  and bowed down  and said 
unto him  what sai th my lord unto his 
servant  15and the captain of the 
lords host said unto joshua  put off 
thy shoe from off thy foot  for the 
place whereon thou standest is holy  
and joshua did so   
now jericho was straitly shut up 
because of the children of israel  
none went out  and none came in  
2and the lord said unto joshua  see 
i have given into thy hand jericho  and 
the king thereof  even the mighty men 
of valour  3and ye shall compass the 
city all the men of war  going about 
the city once  thus shalt tho u do six 
days 4and seven priests shall bear 
seven rams horns before the ark  and 
the seventh day ye shall compass the 
city seven times  and the priests shall 
blow with the horns  5and it shall be  
that when they make a long blast with 
the ram s horn  and when ye hear the 
sound of the horn  all the people shall 
shout with a great shout  and the wall 
of the city shall fall down flat  and the 
people shall go up every man straight 
before him  6and joshua the son of 
nun called the priests  and said unto 
them  take up the ark of the 
covenant  and let seven priests bear 
seven rams horns before the ark of the 
lord 7and he said unto the people  
pass on  and compass the city  and let 
the armed body pass on before the ark 
of the lord 8and it was so  that when joshua had spoken unto the people  the 
seven priests bearing the seven 
rams horns before the lord passed on  
and blew with the horns  and the ark of 
the covenant of the lord followed 
them  9and the armed men went 
before the priests that blew the horns  
and the rearward went after the ark  
the priests  blowing with the horns 
continually  10and joshua commanded 
the people  saying  ye shall not shout  
nor let your voice be heard  neither 
shall any word proceed out of your 
mouth  until the day i bid you shout  
then shall ye shout  11so he caused the 
ark of the lord to compass the city  
going about it once  and they came 
into the camp  and lodged in the camp  
 12and joshua rose early in the 
morning  and the priests took up the 
ark of the lord 13and the seven 
priests bearing the seven rams horns 
before the ark of the lord went on 
continually  and blew with the horns  
and the armed men went before them  
and the rearward came after the ark of 
the lord the priests  blowing with 
the horns continually  14and the 
second day they compassed the city 
once  and returned into the camp  so 
they did six days  15and it came to 
pass on the seventh day  that they rose 
early at the dawning of the day  and 
compassed the city after the same 
manner seven times  only on that day 
they compassed the city seven times  
16and it came to pass at the seventh 
time when the priests blew with the 
horns  that joshua said unto the 6 joshua  
314 
 people  shout for the lord hath 
given you the city  17and the city shall 
be devoted  even it and all that is 
therein to the lord only rahab the 
harlot shall live  she and all that are 
with her in the house  because she hid 
the messengers that we sent  18and ye  
in any wise keep yourselves from the 
devoted thing  lest ye make yourselves 
accursed by taking of the de voted 
thing  so should ye make the camp of 
israel accursed  and trouble it  19but all 
the silver  and gold  and vessels of 
brass and iron  are holy unto the lord 
they shall come into the treasury of the 
lord 20so the people shouted  and 
the priests  blew with the horns  and 
it came to pass  when the people heard 
the sound of the horn  that the people 
shouted with a great shout  and the 
wall fell down flat  so that the people 
went up into the city  every man 
straight before him  and they took the 
city 21and they utterly destroyed all 
that was in the city  both man and 
woman  both young and old  and ox  
and sheep  and ass  with the edge of 
the sword  22and joshua said unto the 
two men that had spied out the land  
go into the harlot s house  and bring 
out thence the woman  and all that she 
hath as ye swore unto her  23and the 
young men the spies went in  and 
brought out rahab  and her father  and 
her mother  and her brethren  and all 
that she had  all her kindred also they 
brought out  and they set them without 
the camp of israel  24and they burnt 
the city with fire  and all that was therein  only the silver  and the gold  
and the vessels of brass and of iron  
they put into the treasury of the house 
of the lord 25but rahab the harlot  
and her father s household  and all that 
she had  did joshua save alive  and she 
dwelt in the midst of israel  unto this 
day because she hid the messengers  
whom joshua sent to spy out jericho   
26and joshua charged the people 
with an oath at that time  saying  
cursed be t he man before the lord 
that riseth up and buildeth this city  
even jericho  with the loss of his first 
born shall he lay the foundation 
thereof  and with the loss of his 
youngest son shall he set up the gates 
of it  
27so the lord was with joshua  and 
his fame was in all the land   
but the children of israel 
committed a trespass concerning 
the devoted thing  for achan  the son 
of carmi  the son of zabdi  the son of 
zerah  of the tribe of judah  took of 
the devoted thing  and the anger of the 
lord was ki ndled against the children 
of israel   
2and joshua sent men from jericho 
to ai  which is beside beth aven  on 
the east side of beth el and spoke 
unto them  saying  go up and spy out 
the land  and the men went up and 
spied out ai  3and they returned to 
joshua  and said unto him  let not all 
the people go up  but let about two or 
three thousand men go up and smite 
ai make not all the people to toil 
thither  for they are but few  4so there 7 joshua  
315 
 went up thither of the people about 
three thousand men  and they fled 
before the men of ai  5and the men of 
ai smote of them about thirty and six 
men and they chased them from 
before the gate even unto shebarim  
and smote them at the descent  and the 
hearts of the people melted  and 
became as water  6and joshua rent hi s 
clothes  and fell to the earth upon his 
face before the ark of the lord until 
the evening  he and the elders of 
israel  and they put dust upon their 
heads  7and joshua said  alas o 
lord g od wherefore hast thou at all 
brought this people over the jorda n to 
deliver us into the hand of the 
amorites  to cause us to perish  would 
that we had been content and dwelt 
beyond the jordan  8oh lord  what 
shall i say  after that israel hath turned 
their backs before their enemies  9for 
when the canaanites and all  the 
inhabitants of the land hear of it  they 
will compass us round  and cut off our 
name from the earth  and what wilt 
thou do for thy great name   
10and the lord said unto joshua  
get thee up  wherefore  now art thou 
fallen upon thy face  11israel hat h 
sinned  yea they have even 
transgressed my covenant which i 
commanded them  yea they have even 
taken of the devoted thing  and have 
also stolen  and dissembled also  and 
they have even put it among their own 
stuff 12therefore the children of israel 
cannot stand before their enemies  they 
turn their backs before their enemies  because they are become accursed  i 
will not be with you any more  except 
ye destroy the accursed from among 
you 13up sanctify the people  and 
say sanctify yourselves against 
tomorrow  for thus saith the lord the 
god of israel  there is a curse in the 
midst of thee  o israel  thou canst not 
stand before thine enemies  until ye 
take away the accursed thing from 
among you  14in the morning therefore 
ye shall draw near by your tri bes and 
it shall be  that the tribe which the 
lord taketh shall come near by 
families  and the family which the 
lord shall take shall come near by 
households  and the household which 
the lord shall take shall come near 
man by man  15and it shall be that h e 
that is taken with the devoted thing 
shall be burnt with fire  he and all that 
he hath  because he hath transgressed 
the covenant of the lord and because 
he hath wrought a wanton deed in 
israel   
16so joshua rose up early in the 
morning  and brought is rael near by 
their tribes  and the tribe of judah was 
taken  17and he brought near the 
family of judah  and he took the 
family of the zerahites  and he 
brought near the family of the 
zerahites man by man  and zabdi was 
taken  18and he brought near his 
hous ehold man by man  and achan  
the son of carmi  the son of zabdi  the 
son of zerah  of the tribe of judah  was 
taken  19and joshua said unto achan  
my son  give i pray thee  glory to the joshua  
316 
 lord the god of israel  and make 
confession unto him  and tell me n ow 
what thou hast done  hide nothing 
from me  20and achan answered 
joshua  and said  of a truth i have 
sinned against the lord the god of 
israel  and thus and thus have i done  
21when i saw among the spoil a 
goodly shinar mantle  and two 
hundred shekels  of silver  and a wedge 
of gold of fifty shekels weight  then i 
coveted them  and took them  and 
behold  they are hid in the earth in the 
midst of my tent  and the silver under 
it 22so joshua sent messengers  and 
they ran unto the tent  and behold  it 
was hid in his tent  and the silver under 
it 23and they took them from the 
midst of the tent  and brought them 
unto joshua  and unto all the children 
of israel  and they laid them down 
before the lord 24and joshua  and all 
israel with him  took achan the  son of 
zerah  and the silver  and the mantle  
and the wedge of gold  and his sons  
and his daughters  and his oxen  and 
his asses  and his sheep  and his tent  
and all that he had  and they brought 
them up unto the valley of achor  
25and joshua said  why  hast thou 
troubled us  the lord shall trouble 
thee this day  and all israel stoned 
him with stones  and they burned them 
with fire  and stoned them with stones  
26and they raised over him a great 
heap of stones  unto this day  and the 
lord turned from th e fierceness of his 
anger  wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of aachor  
unto this day   
and the lord said unto joshua  
fear not  neither be thou 
dismayed  take all the people of war 
with thee  and arise  go up to ai  see i 
have giv en into thy hand the king of 
ai and his people  and his city  and 
his land  2and thou shalt do to ai and 
her king as thou didst unto jericho and 
her king  only the spoil thereof  and 
the cattle thereof  shall ye take for a 
prey unto yourselves  set thee a n 
ambush for the city behind it  3so 
joshua arose  and all the people of 
war to go up to ai  and joshua chose 
out thirty thousand men  the mighty 
men of valour  and sent them forth by 
night  4and he commanded them  
saying  behold  ye shall lie in ambush  
against the city  behind the city  go not 
very far from the city  but be ye all 
ready  5and i  and all the people that 
are with me  will approach unto the 
city and it shall come to pass  when 
they come out against us  as at the 
first that we will flee b efore them  
6and they will come out after us  till 
we have drawn them away from the 
city for they will say  they flee before 
us as at the first  so we will flee 
before them  7and ye shall rise up 
from the ambush  and take possession 
of the city  for the lord your god will 
deliver it into your hand  8and it shall 
be when ye have seized upon the city  
that ye shall set the city on fire  
                                                      
a that is troubling  8 joshua

 according to the word of the lord 
shall ye do  see i have commanded 
you 9and joshua sent them forth  and 
they went to the ambushment  and 
abode between beth el and ai  on the 
west side of ai  but joshua lodged that 
night among the people   
10and joshua rose up early in the 
morning  and numbered the people  
and went up  he and the elders of 
israel  before the people to ai  11and 
all the people  even the men of war 
that were with him  went up  and drew 
nigh and came before the city  and 
pitched on the north side of ai now 
there was a valley between him and 
ai 12and he took about five thousand 
men and set them in ambush be tween 
beth el and ai  on the west side of ai  
13so the people set themselves in 
array  even all the host that was on the 
north of the city  their rear lying in 
wait on the west of the city  and 
joshua went that night into the midst 
of the vale  14and it ca me to pass  
when the king of ai saw it  that the 
men of the city hastened and rose up 
early and went out against israel to 
battle  he and all his people  at the time 
appointed  in front of the arabah  but 
he knew not that there was an ambush 
against him be hind the city  15and 
joshua and all israel made as if they 
were beaten before them  and fled by 
the way of the wilderness  16and all 
the people that were in ai were called 
together to pursue after them  and they 
pursued after joshua  and were drawn 
away fr om the city  17and there was not a man left in ai or beth el that 
went not out after israel  and they left 
the city open  and pursued after israel   
18and the lord said unto joshua  
stretch out the javelin that is in thy 
hand toward ai  for i will give i t into 
thy hand  and joshua stretched out 
the javelin that was in his hand toward 
the city  19and the ambush arose 
quickly out of their place  and they ran 
as soon as he had stretched out his 
hand  and entered into the city  and 
took it  and they hastened  and set the 
city on fire  20and when the men of ai 
looked behind them  they saw  and 
behold  the smoke of the city ascended 
up to heaven  and they had no power 
to flee this way or that way  and the 
people that fled to the wilderness 
turned back upon the pursuers  21and 
when joshua and all israel saw that the 
ambush had taken the city  and that the 
smoke of the city ascended  then they 
turned back  and slew the men of ai  
22and the other came forth out of the 
city against them  so they were in the 
midst of  israel  some on this side  and 
some on that side  and they smote 
them  so that they let none of them 
remain or escape  23and the king of ai 
they took alive  and brought him to 
joshua   
24and it came to pass  when israel 
had made an end of slaying all the 
inhabitants of ai in the field  even in 
the wilderness wherein they pursued 
them  and they were all fallen by the 
edge of the sword  until they were 
consumed  that all israel returned unto joshua  
318 
 ai and smote it with the edge of the 
sword  25and all that fell th at day  both 
of men and women  were twelve 
thousand  even all the men of ai  26for 
joshua drew not back his hand  
wherewith he stretched out the javelin  
until he had utterly destroyed all the 
inhabitants of ai  27only the cattle and 
the spoil of that city  israel took for a 
prey unto themselves  according unto 
the word of the lord which he 
commanded joshua  28so joshua burnt 
ai and made it a heap for ever  even a 
desolation  unto this day  29and the 
king of ai he hanged on a tree until the 
eventide  and at  the going down of the 
sun joshua commanded  and they took 
his carcass down from the tree  and 
cast it at the entrance of the gate of the 
city and raised thereon a great heap of 
stones  unto this day   
30then joshua built an altar unto the 
lord the god o f israel  in mount ebal  
31as moses the servant of the lord 
commanded the children of israel  as it 
is written in the book of the law of 
moses  an altar of unhewn stones  
upon which no man had lifted up any 
iron and they offered thereon burnt 
offerings un to the lord and sacrificed 
peace offerings  32and he wrote there 
upon the stones a copy of the law of 
moses  which he wrote before the 
children of israel  33and all israel  and 
their elders and officers  and their 
judges  stood on this side the ark and 
on that side before the priests the 
levites  that bore the ark of the 
covenant of the lord as well the stranger as the home born half of 
them in front of mount gerizim and 
half of them in front of mount ebal  as 
moses the servant of the lord had 
commanded at the first  that they 
should bless the people of israel  
34and afterward he read all the words 
of the law  the blessing and the curse  
according to all that is written in the 
book of the law  35there was not a 
word of all that moses commanded  
which josh ua read not before all the 
assembly of israel  and the women  
and the little ones  and the strangers 
that walked among them   
and it came to pass  when all the 
kings that were beyond the 
jordan  in the hill country  and in the 
lowland  and on all the sho re of the 
great sea in front of lebanon  the 
hittite  and the amorite  the 
canaanite  the perizzite  the hivite  
and the jebusite  heard thereof  2that 
they gathered themselves together  to 
fight with joshua and with israel  with 
one accord   
3but when the  inhabitants of gibeon 
heard what joshua had done unto 
jericho and to ai  4they also did work 
wilily  and went and made as if they 
had been ambassadors  and took old 
sacks upon their asses  and wine skins  
worn and rent and patched up  5and 
worn shoes and clouted upon their 
feet and worn garments upon them  
and all the bread of their provision was 
dry and was become crumbs  6and 
they went to joshua unto the camp at 
gilgal  and said unto him  and to the 9 joshua  
319 
 men of israel  we are come from a far 
country  now th erefore make ye a 
covenant with us  7and the men of 
israel said unto the hivites  
peradventure ye dwell among us  and 
how shall we make a covenant with 
you 8and they said unto joshua  we 
are thy servants  and joshua said unto 
them  who are ye  and f rom whence 
come ye  9and they said unto him  
from a very far country thy servants 
are come because of the name of the 
lord thy god  for we have heard the 
fame of him  and all that he did in 
egypt  10and all that he did to the two 
kings of the amorites  that were 
beyond the jordan  to sihon king of 
heshbon  and to og king of bashan  
who was at ashtaroth  11and our 
elders and all the inhabitants of our 
country spoke to us  saying  take 
provision in your hand for the journey  
and go to meet them  and say unt o 
them  we are your servants  and now 
make ye a covenant with us  12this our 
bread we took hot for our provision 
out of our houses on the day we came 
forth to go unto you  but now  behold  
it is dry  and is become crumbs  13and 
these wine skins  which we f illed 
were new  and behold  they are rent  
and these our garments and our shoes 
are worn by reason of the very long 
journey  14and the men took of their 
provision  and asked not counsel at the 
mouth of the lord 15and joshua made 
peace with them  and ma de a covenant 
with them  to let them live  and the princes of the congregation swore unto 
them   
16and it came to pass at the end of 
three days after they had made a 
covenant with them  that they heard 
that they were their neighbours  and 
that they dwelt a mong them  17and the 
children of israel journeyed  and came 
unto their cities on the third day  now 
their cities were gibeon  and 
chephirah  and beeroth  and kiriath 
jearim  18and the children of israel 
smote them not  because the princes of 
the congregati on had sworn unto them 
by the lord the god of israel  and all 
the congregation murmured against the 
princes  19but all the princes said unto 
all the congregation  we have sworn 
unto them by the lord the god of 
israel  now therefore we may not 
touch them  20this we will do to them  
and let them live  lest wrath be upon 
us because of the oath which we 
swore unto them  21and the princes 
said concerning them  let them live  
so they became hewers of wood and 
drawers of water unto all the 
congregation  as the princes had 
spoken concerning them  22and joshua 
called for them  and he spoke unto 
them  saying  wherefore have ye 
beguiled us  saying  we are very far 
from you  when ye dwell among us  
23now therefore ye are cursed  and 
there shall never fail to be of you 
bondmen  both hewers of wood and 
drawers of water for the house of my 
god 24and they answered joshua  
and said  because it was certainly told joshua  
320 
 thy servants  how that the lord thy 
god commanded his servant moses to 
give you all the land  and to des troy all 
the inhabitants of the land from before 
you therefore we were sore afraid for 
our lives because of you  and have 
done this thing  25and now  behold  we 
are in thy hand  as it seemeth good and 
right unto thee to do unto us  do 
26and so did he un to them  and 
delivered them out of the hand of the 
children of israel  that they slew them 
not 27and joshua made them that day 
hewers of wood and drawers of water 
for the congregation  and for the altar 
of the lord unto this day  in the place 
which he sh ould choose   
now it came to pass  when 
adoni zedek king of 
jerusalem heard how joshua had taken 
ai and had utterly destroyed it  as he 
had done to jericho and her king  so he 
had done to ai and her king  and how 
the inhabitants of gibeon had made 
peace with israel  and were among 
them  2that they feared greatly  
because gibeon was a great city  as 
one of the royal cities  and because it 
was greater than ai  and all the men 
thereof were mighty  3wherefore 
adoni zedek king of jerusalem sent 
unto hoham ki ng of hebron  and unto 
piram king of jarmuth  and unto 
japhia king of lachish  and unto debir 
king of eglon  saying  4come up unto 
me and help me  and let us smite 
gibeon  for it hath made peace with 
joshua and with the children of israel  
5therefore th e five kings of the amorites  the king of jerusalem  the 
king of hebron  the king of jarmuth  
the king of lachish  the king of eglon  
gathered themselves together  and 
went up  they and all their hosts  and 
encamped against gibeon  and made 
war against it  6and the men of gibeon 
sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal  
saying  slack not thy hands from thy 
servants  come up to us quickly  and 
save us  and help us  for all the kings 
of the amorites that dwell in the hill 
country are gathered together against 
us 7so joshua went up from gilgal  
he and all the people of war with him  
and all the mighty men of valour   
8and the lord said unto joshua  
fear them not  for i have delivered 
them into thy hand  there shall not a 
man of them stand against thee  
9joshua therefore came upon them 
suddenly  for he went up from gilgal 
all the night  10and the lord 
discomfited them before israel  and 
slew them with a great slaughter at 
gibeon  and they chased them by the 
way of the ascent of beth horon  and 
smote them to a zekah  and unto 
makkedah  11and it came to pass  as 
they fled from before israel  while they 
were at the descent of beth horon  that 
the lord cast down great stones from 
heaven upon them unto azekah  and 
they died  they were more who died 
with the hailston es than they whom the 
children of israel slew with the sword   
12then spoke joshua to the lord in 
the day when the lord delivered up 
the amorites before the children of 10 joshua  
321 
 israel  and he said in the sight of 
israel   
sun stand thou still upon gibeon   
and thou moon  in the valley of 
aijalon   
13and the sun stood still  and the 
moon stayed   
until the nation had avenged 
themselves of their enemies   
is not this written in the book of 
jashar  and the sun stayed in the 
midst of heaven  and hasted not to go 
down about a whole day  14and there 
was no day like that before it or after 
it that the lord hearkened unto the 
voice of a man  for the lord fought for 
israel   
15and joshua returned  and all israel 
with him  unto the camp to gilgal   
16and these five kings  fled and hid 
themselves in the cave at makkedah  
17and it was told joshua  saying  the 
five kings are found  hidden in the 
cave at makkedah  18and joshua said  
roll great stones unto the mouth of 
the cave  and set men by it to keep 
them  19but stay no t ye pursue after 
your enemies  and smite the hindmost 
of them  suffer them not to enter into 
their cities  for the lord your god hath 
delivered them into your hand  20and 
it came to pass  when joshua and the 
children of israel had made an end of 
slaying  them with a very great 
slaughter  till they were consumed  and 
the remnant which remained of them 
had entered into the fortified cities  
21that all the people returned to the 
camp to joshua at makkedah in peace  none whetted his tongue against any of 
the children of israel  22then said 
joshua  open the mouth of the cave  
and bring forth those five kings unto 
me out of the cave  23and they did so  
and brought forth those five kings unto 
him out of the cave  the king of 
jerusalem  the king of hebron  the 
king of jarmuth  the king of lachish  
the king of eglon  24and it came to 
pass when they brought forth those 
kings unto joshua  that joshua called 
for all the men of israel  and said unto 
the chiefs of the men of war that went 
with him  come near  put you r feet 
upon the necks of these kings  and 
they came near  and put their feet upon 
the necks of them  25and joshua said 
unto them  fear not  nor be dismayed  
be strong and of good courage  for 
thus shall the lord do to all your 
enemies against whom ye fig ht 26and 
afterward joshua smote them  and put 
them to death  and hanged them on 
five trees  and they were hanging upon 
the trees until the evening  27and it 
came to pass at the time of the going 
down of the sun  that joshua 
commanded  and they took them down 
off the trees  and cast them into the 
cave wherein they had hidden 
themselves  and laid great stones on 
the mouth of the cave  unto this very 
day  
28and joshua took makkedah on 
that day  and smote it with the edge of 
the sword  and the king thereof  he 
utterly destroyed them and all the 
souls that were therein  he left none joshua  
322 
 remaining  and he did to the king of 
makkedah as he had done unto the 
king of jericho   
29and joshua passed from 
makkedah  and all israel with him  
unto libnah  and fought against 
libnah  30and the lord delivered it 
also and the king thereof  into the 
hand of israel  and he smote it with the 
edge of the sword  and all the souls 
that were therein  he left none 
remaining in it  and he did unto the 
king thereof as he had done unto the  
king of jericho   
31and joshua passed from libnah  
and all israel with him  unto lachish  
and encamped against it  and fought 
against it  32and the lord delivered 
lachish into the hand of israel  and he 
took it on the second day  and smote it 
with the edg e of the sword  and all the 
souls that were therein  according to 
all that he had done to libnah   
33then horam king of gezer came 
up to help lachish  and joshua smote 
him and his people  until he had left 
him none remaining   
34and joshua passed from lach ish 
and all israel with him  unto eglon  
and they encamped against it  and 
fought against it  35and they took it on 
that day  and smote it with the edge of 
the sword  and all the souls that were 
therein he utterly destroyed that day  
according to all that  he had done to 
lachish   
36and joshua went up from eglon  
and all israel with him  unto hebron  
and they fought against it  37and they took it  and smote it with the edge of 
the sword  and the king thereof  and all 
the cities thereof  and all the souls th at 
were therein  he left none remaining  
according to all that he had done to 
eglon  but he utterly destroyed it  and 
all the souls that were therein   
38and joshua turned back  and all 
israel with him  to debir  and fought 
against it  39and he took it  and the 
king thereof  and all the cities thereof  
and they smote them with the edge of 
the sword  and utterly destroyed all the 
souls that were therein  he left none 
remaining  as he had done to hebron  
so he did to debir  and to the king 
thereof  as he had done also to libnah  
and to the king thereof   
40so joshua smote all the land  the 
hillcountry  and the south  and the 
lowland  and the slopes  and all their 
kings  he left none remaining  but he 
utterly destroyed all that breathed  as 
the lord the god o f israel  
commanded  41and joshua smote them 
from kadesh barnea even unto gaza  
and all the country of goshen  even 
unto gibeon  42and all these kings and 
their land did joshua take at one time  
because the lord the god of israel  
fought for israel  43and joshua 
returned  and all israel with him  unto 
the camp to gilgal   
and it came to pass  when 
jabin king of hazor heard 
thereof  that he sent to jobab king of 
madon  and to the king of shimron  
and to the king of achshaph  2and to 
the kings that were o n the north  in the 11 joshua  
323 
 hillcountry and in the arabah south of 
chinneroth  and in the lowland  and 
in the regions of dor on the west  3to 
the canaanite on the east and on the 
west and the amorite  and the hittite  
and the perizzite  and the jebusite in 
the h illcountry  and the hivite under 
hermon in the land of mizpah  4and 
they went out  they and all their hosts 
with them  much people  even as the 
sand that is upon the sea shore in 
multitude  with horses and chariots 
very many  5and all these kings met 
together and they came and pitched 
together at the waters of merom  to 
fight with israel   
6and the lord said unto joshua  be 
not afraid because of them  for to 
morrow at this time will i deliver them 
up all slain before israel  thou shalt 
hough their horses  and burn their 
chariots with fire  7so joshua came  
and all the people of war with him  
against them by the waters of merom 
suddenly  and fell upon them  8and the 
lord delivered them into the hand of 
israel  and they smote them  and 
chased them unto gre at zidon  and 
unto misrephoth maim  and unto the 
valley of mizpeh eastward  and they 
smote them  until they left them none 
remaining  9and joshua did unto them 
as the lord bade him  he houghed 
their horses  and burnt their chariots 
with fire   
10and joshua  turned back at that 
time and took hazor  and smote the 
king thereof with the sword  for hazor 
beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms  11and they smote all the 
souls that were therein with the edge 
of the sword  utterly destroying them  
there was n one left that breathed  and 
he burnt hazor with fire  12and all the 
cities of those kings  and all the kings 
of them  did joshua take  and he smote 
them with the edge of the sword  and 
utterly destroyed them  as moses the 
servant of the lord commanded  13but 
as for the cities that stood on their 
mounds  israel burned none of them  
save hazor only that did joshua 
burn 14and all the spoil of these cities  
and the cattle  the children of israel 
took for a prey unto themselves  but 
every man they smote with th e edge of 
the sword  until they had destroyed 
them  neither left they any that 
breathed  15as the lord commanded 
moses his servant  so did moses 
command joshua  and so did joshua  
he left nothing undone of all that the 
lord commanded moses   
16so joshua to ok all that land  the 
hillcountry  and all the south  and all 
the land of goshen  and the lowland  
and the arabah  and the hill country of 
israel  and the lowland of the same  
17from the bare mountain  that goeth 
up to seir  even unto baal gad in the 
valley of lebanon under mount 
hermon  and all their kings he took  
and smote them  and put them to 
death  18joshua made war a long time 
with all those kings  19there was not a 
city that made peace with the children 
of israel  save the hivites the 
inhabitants o f gibeon  they took all in joshua  
324 
 battle  20for it was of the lord to 
harden their hearts  to come against 
israel in battle  that they might be 
utterly destroyed  that they might have 
no favour  but that they might be 
destroyed  as the lord commanded 
moses   
21and joshua came at that time  and 
cut off the anakim from the hill 
country  from hebron  from debir  
from anab  and from all the hill 
country of judah  and from all the hill 
country of israel  joshua utterly 
destroyed them with their cities  
22there was none  of the anakim left in 
the land of the children of israel  only 
in gaza  in gath  and in ashdod  did 
some remain  23so joshua took the 
whole land  according to all that the 
lord spoke unto moses  and joshua 
gave it for an inheritance unto israel 
according to their divisions by their 
tribes  and the land had rest from war   
now these are the kings of the 
land whom the children of 
israel smote  and possessed their land 
beyond the jordan toward the 
sunrising  from the valley of arnon 
unto mount hermon  and all the 
arabah eastward  2sihon king of the

that dwelt in the land  22balaam also 
the son of beor  the soothsayer  did the 
children of israel slay with the sword 
among the rest of their slain  23and as 
for the border of the children of

this was the inheritance of the

families   
32these are the inheritances which 
moses distributed in the plains of 
moab  beyond the jordan at jericho  
eastward  33but unto the tribe of levi 
moses gave no inheritance  the lord 
the god of israel  is their inheritance  
as he spoke unto them   joshua  
327 
 and these are the inheritances 
which the children of israel  
took in the land of canaan  which 
eleazar the priest  and joshua the son 
of nun  and the heads of the 
fathers houses of the tribes of the 
children of israel  distributed unto 
them  2by the lot of their inheritance  
as the lord commanded by the hand 
of mos es for the nine tribes  and for 
the half tribe 3for moses had given 
the inheritance of the two tribes and 
the half tribe beyond the jordan  but 
unto the levites he gave no 
inheritance among them  4for the 
children of joseph were two tribes  
manasseh and  ephraim  and they gave 
no portion unto the levites in the land  
save cities to dwell in  with the open 
land about them for their cattle and for 
their substance  5as the lord 
commanded moses  so the children of 
israel did  and they divided the land   
6then the children of judah drew 
nigh unto joshua in gilgal  and caleb 
the son of jephunneh the kenizzite 
said unto him  thou knowest the 
thing that the lord spoke unto moses 
the man of god concerning me and 
concerning thee in kadesh barnea  
7forty years old was i when moses the 
servant of the lord sent me from 
kadesh barnea to spy out the land  and 
i brought him back word as it was in 
my heart  8nevertheless my brethren 
that went up with me made the heart of 
the people melt  but i wholly followed 
the lord my god 9and moses swore 
on that day  saying  surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be 
an inheritance to thee and to thy 
children for ever  because thou hast 
wholly followed the lord my god  
10and now  behold  the lord hath kept 
me alive  as he spoke  these forty and 
five years  from the time that the lord 
spoke this word unto moses  while 
israel walked in the wilderness  and 
now lo i am this day fourscore and 
five years old  11as yet i am as strong 
this day as i was in the day that moses 
sent me as my strength was then  even 
so is my strength now  for war  and to 
go out and to come in  12now therefore 
give me this mountain  whereof the 
lord spoke in that day  for thou 
heardest in that day how the anakim 
were there  and cities great and 
fortifi ed it may be that the lord will 
be with me  and i shall drive them out  
as the lord spoke  13and joshua 
blessed him  and he gave hebron unto 
caleb the son of jephunneh for an 
inheritance  14therefore hebron 
became the inheritance of caleb the 
son of jeph unneh the kenizzite  unto 
this day  because that he wholly 
followed the lord the god of israel  
15now the name of hebron beforetime 
was akiriath arba which arba was the 
greatest man among the anakim  and 
the land had rest from war   
and the lot for th e tribe of the 
children of judah according to 
their families was unto the border of 
edom  even to the wilderness of zin

the children of judah  according to the 
commandment of the lord to joshua  
even kiriath arba which arba was the 
father of anak the same is hebron  
14and caleb drove out thence the three 
sons of anak  sheshai  and ahima n 
and talmai  the children of anak  
15and he went up thence against the 
inhabitants of debir now the name of 
debir beforetime was kiriath sepher  
16and caleb said  he that smiteth 
kiriath sepher  and taketh it  to him 
will i give achsah my daughter to 
wife 17and othniel the son of kenaz  
the brother of caleb  took it  and he 
gave him achsah his daughter to wife  joshua  
329 
 18and it came to pass  when she came 
unto him  that she persuaded him to 
ask of her father a field  and she 
alighted from off her ass  and cale b 
said unto her  what wouldest thou  
19and she said  give me a blessing

and the lot for the children of 
joseph went out from the 
jordan at jericho  at the waters of 
jericho on the east  going up from 
jeric ho through the hill country to the 
wilderness  even to beth el 2and it 
went out from beth elluz and passed

thereof were at the sea  this is the

of ephra im according to their families  
9together with the cities which were 
separated for the children of ephraim 
in the midst of the inheritance of the 
children of manasseh  all the cities 
with their villages  10and they drove 
not out the canaanites that dwelt i n 
gezer  but the canaanites dwelt in the 
midst of ephraim  unto this day  and 
became servants to do taskwork   
 
and this was the lot for the 
tribe of manasseh  for he was 
the first born of joseph  as for machir 
the first born of manasseh  the father 
of gilead  because he was a man of 
war therefore he had gilead and 
bashan  2and the lot was for the rest 
of the children of manasseh according 
to their families  for the children of 
abiezer  and for the children of helek  
and for the children of asriel  and for 
the children of shechem  and for the 
children of hepher  and for the 
children of shemida  these were the 
male children of manasseh the son of 
joseph according to their families  
3but zelophehad  the son of hepher  
the son of gilead  the son of machir  16 
17 joshua  
331 
 the son of manasseh  had no sons  but 
daughters  and these are the names of 
his daughters  mahlah  and noah  
hoglah  milcah  and tirzah  4and they 
came near before eleazar the priest  
and before joshua the son of nun  and 
before the princes  saying  the lord 
commanded moses to give us an 
inheritance among our brethren  
therefore according to the 
commandment of the lord he gave 
them an inheritance among the 
brethren of their father  5and there fell 
ten parts to manasseh  beside the land 
of gilead and basha n which is beyond 
the jordan  6because the daughters of 
manasseh had an inheritance among 
his sons  and the land of gilead 
belonged unto the rest of the sons of 
manasseh   
7and the border of manasseh was  
beginning from asher  michmethath  
which is before  shechem  and the 
border went along to the right hand  
unto the inhabitants of en tappuah  
8the land of tappuah belonged to 
manasseh  but tappuah on the border 
of manasseh belonged to the children 
of ephraim  9and the border went 
down unto the brook of k anah  
southward of the brook  by cities 
which belonged to ephraim among the 
cities of manasseh  but the border of 
manasseh was on the north side of the 
brook  and the goings out thereof were 
at the sea  10southward it was 
ephraim s and northward it was 
manasseh s and the sea was his border  and they reached to asher on 
the north  and to issachar on the east   
11and manasseh had in issachar and 
in asher beth shean and its towns  and 
ibleam and its towns  and the 
inhabitants of dor and its towns  and 
the in habitants of en dor and its 
towns  and the inhabitants of taanach 
and its towns  and the inhabitants of 
megiddo and its towns  even the three 
regions  12yet the children of 
manasseh could not drive out the 
inhabitants of those cities  but the 
canaanites we re resolved to dwell in 
that land  13and it came to pass  when 
the children of israel were waxen 
strong  that they put the canaanites to 
taskwork  but did not utterly drive 
them out   
14and the children of joseph spoke 
unto joshua  saying  why hast thou 
given me but one lot and one part for 
an inheritance  seeing i am a great 
people  forasmuch as the lord hath 
blessed me thus  15and joshua said 
unto them  if thou be a great people  
get thee up to the forest  and cut down 
for thyself there in the land of the 
perizzites and of the rephaim  since 
the hill country of ephraim is too 
narrow for thee  16and the children of 
joseph said  the hill country will not 
be enough for us  and all the 
canaanites that dwell in the land of the 
valley have chariots of iron  both they 
who are in beth shean and its towns  
and they who are in the valley of 
jezreel  17and joshua spoke unto the 
house of joseph  even to ephraim and joshua  
332 
 to manasseh  saying  thou art a great 
people  and hast great power  thou 
shalt not have one lot on ly 18but the 
hillcountry shall be thine  for though 
it is a forest  thou shalt cut it down  
and the goings out thereof shall be 
thine  for thou shalt drive out the 
canaanites  though they have chariots 
of iron  and though they be strong   
and the who le congregation of 
the children of israel 
assembled themselves together at 
shiloh  and set up the tent of meeting 
there  and the land was subdued before 
them  2and there remained among the 
children of israel seven tribes  which 
had not yet received their i nheritance  
3and joshua said unto the children of 
israel  how long are ye slack to go in 
to possess the land  which the lord 
the god of your fathers  hath given 
you 4appoint for you three men for 
each tribe  and i will send them  and 
they shall arise  and walk through the 
land and describe it according to their 
inheritance  and they shall come unto 
me 5and they shall divide it into 
seven portions  judah shall abide in his 
border on the south  and the house of 
joseph shall abide in their border on 
the n orth 6and ye shall describe the 
land into seven portions  and bring the 
description hither to me  and i will cast 
lots for you here before the lord our 
god 7for the levites have no portion 
among you  for the priesthood of the 
lord is their inheritance  and gad and 
reuben and the half tribe of manasseh 
have received their inheritance beyond the jordan eastward  which moses the 
servant of the lord gave them   
8and the men arose  and went  and 
joshua charged them that went to 
describe the land  saying  go and 
walk through the land  and describe it  
and come back to me  and i will cast 
lots for you here before the lord in 
shiloh  9and the men went and 
passed through the land  and described 
it by cities into seven portions in a 
book  and they came to joshua unto 
the camp at shiloh  10and joshua cast 
lots for them in shiloh before the 
lord and there joshua divided the 
land unto the children of israel 
according to their divisions   
11and the lot of the tribe of the 
children of benjamin came up 
according to the ir families  and the 
border of their lot went out between 
the children of judah and the children 
of joseph  12and their border on the

the border went up to the side of

a these two verses taken from i 
chron vi 63 64 a re excluded from 
the text in authorative codicies and 
placed in the margin  open land round about it  thus it shall 
be with all these cities   
43so the lord gave unto israel all 
the land which he swore to give unto 
their fathers  and they possessed it  and 
dwelt therein  44and the lord gave 
them rest round about  according to all 
that he swore unto their fathers  and 
there stood not a man of all their 
enemies against them  the lord 
delivered all their enemies into their 
hand  45there failed not aught of any 
good thing which the lord had spoken 
unto the house of israel  all came to 
pass  
then joshua called the 
reubenites  and the gadites  
and the half tribe of manasseh  2and 
said unto them  ye have kept all that 
moses the servant of the lord 
commanded  you and have hearkened 
unto my voice in all that i commanded 
you 3ye have not left your brethren 
these many days unto this day  but 
have kept the charge of the 
commandment of the lord your god  
4and now the lord your god hath 
given rest unto your brethr en as he 
spoke unto them  therefore now turn 
ye and get you unto your tents  unto 
the land of your possession  which 
moses the servant of the lord gave 
you beyond the jordan  5only take 
diligent heed to do the commandment 
and the law  which moses the ser vant 
of the lord commanded you  to love 
the lord your god  and to walk in all 
his ways  and to keep his 
commandments  and to cleave unto 22 joshua  
339 
 him and to serve him with all your 
heart and with all your soul  6so 
joshua blessed them  and sent them 
away  and the y went unto their tents   
7now to the one half tribe of 
manasseh moses had given 
inheritance in bashan  but unto the 
other half gave joshua among their 
brethren beyond the jordan westward  
moreover when joshua sent them 
away unto their tents  he blessed th em 
8and spoke unto them  saying  return 
with much wealth unto your tents  and 
with very much cattle  with silver  and 
with gold  and with brass  and with 
iron and with very much raiment  
divide the spoil of your enemies with 
your brethren   
9and the ch ildren of reuben and the 
children of gad and the half tribe of 
manasseh returned  and departed from 
the children of israel out of shiloh  
which is in the land of canaan  to go 
unto the land of gilead  to the land of 
their possession  whereof they were 
possessed  according to the 
commandment of the lord by the hand 
of moses  10and when they came unto 
the region about the jordan  that is in 
the land of canaan  the children of 
reuben and the children of gad and 
the half tribe of manasseh built there 
an altar b y the jordan  a great altar to 
look upon  11and the children of israel 
heard say  behold  the children of 
reuben and the children of gad and 
the half tribe of manasseh have built 
an altar in the forefront of the land of 
canaan  in the region about the jor dan on the side that pertaineth to the 
children of israel  12and when the 
children of israel heard of it  the whole 
congregation of the children of israel 
gathered themselves together at 
shiloh  to go up against them to war   
13and the children of israel  sent 
unto the children of reuben  and to the 
children of gad  and to the half tribe 
of manasseh  into the land of gilead  
phinehas the son of eleazar the priest  
14and with him ten princes  one prince 
of a fathers house for each of the tribes 
of israel  and they were every one of 
them head of their fathers houses 
among the thousands of israel  15and 
they came unto the children of 
reuben  and to the children of gad  
and to the half tribe of manasseh  unto 
the land of gilead  and they spoke 
with them  saying  16thus saith the 
whole congregation of the lord what 
treachery is this that ye have 
committed against the god of israel  to 
turn away this day from following the 
lord in that ye have builded you an 
altar to rebel this day against the 
lord 17is the i niquity of peor too little 
for us  from which we have not 
cleansed ourselves unto this day  
although there came a plague upon the 
congregation of the lord 18that ye 
must turn away this day from 
following the lord and it will be  
seeing ye rebel to day ag ainst the 
lord that to morrow he will be wroth 
with the whole congregation of israel  
19howbeit  if the land of your 
possession be unclean  then pass ye joshua  
340 
 over unto the land of the possession of 
the lord wherein the l ords 
tabernacle dwelleth  and take 
possession among us  but rebel not 
against the lord nor rebel against us  
in building you an altar besides the 
altar of the lord our god  20did not 
achan the son of zerah commit a 
trespass concerning the devoted thing  
and wrath fell upon all the 
congregatio n of israel  and that man 
perished not alone in his iniquity   
21then the children of reuben and 
the children of gad and the half tribe 
of manasseh answered  and spoke unto 
the heads of the thousands of israel  
22god god the lord god god the 
lord he knoweth  and israel he shall 
know  if it be in rebellion  or if in 
treachery against the l ordsave thou 
us not this day  23that we have built 
us an altar to turn away from following 
the lord or if to offer thereon burnt 
offering or meal offering  or if to offer 
sacrifices of peace offerings thereon  
let the lord himself require it  24and if 
we have not rather out of anxiety about 
a matter done this  saying  in time to 
come your children might speak unto 
our children  saying  what have ye to 
do with the lord the god of israel  
25for the lord hath made the jordan a 
border between us and you  ye 
children of reuben and children of 
gad ye have no portion in the lord 
so might your children make our 
children cease from fearing the lord 
26therefore we said  let us now 
prepare to build us an altar  not for burnt offering  nor for sacrifice  27but 
it shall be a witness between us and 
you and between our generations after 
us that we may do the service of the 
lord before him with our burnt 
offerings  and with ou r sacrifices  and 
with our peace offerings  that your 
children may not say to our children in 
time to come  ye have no portion in 
the lord 28therefore said we  it shall 
be when they so say to us or to our 
generations in time to come  that we 
shall say  behold the pattern of the 
altar of the lord which our fathers 
made  not for burnt offering  nor for 
sacrifice  but it is a witness between us 
and you  29far be it from us that we 
should rebel against the lord and turn 
away this day from following the 
lord to build an altar for burnt 
offering  for meal offering  or for 
sacrifice  besides the altar of the lord 
our god that is before his tabernacle   
30and when phinehas the priest  and 
the princes of the congregation  even 
the heads of the thousands of isra el 
that were with him  heard the words 
that the children of reuben and the 
children of gad and the children of 
manasseh spoke  it pleased them well  
31and phinehas the son of eleazar the 
priest said unto the children of 
reuben  and to the children of gad  
and to the children of manasseh  this 
day we know that the lord is in the 
midst of us  because ye have not 
committed this treachery against the 
lord now have ye delivered the 
children of israel out of the hand of the joshua  
341 
 lord 32and phinehas the son of 
eleazar the priest  and the princes  
returned from the children of reuben  
and from the children of gad  out of 
the land of gilead  unto the land of 
canaan  to the children of israel  and 
brought them back word  33and the 
thing pleased the children of israel  
and the children of israel blessed god  
and spoke no more of going up against 
them to war  to destroy the land 
wherein the children of reuben and 
the children of gad dwelt  34and the 
children of reuben and the children of 
gad called the altar  for it is a 
witness between us that the lord is 
god  
and it came to pass after many 
days when the lord had given 
rest unto israel from all their enemies 
round about  and joshua was old and 
well stricken in years  2that joshua 
called for all israel  for their e lders and 
for their heads  and for their judges 
and for their officers  and said unto 
them  i am old and well stricken in 
years  3and ye have seen all that the 
lord your god hath done unto all 
these nations because of you  for the 
lord your god  he it is that hath 
fought for you  4behold  i have allotted 
unto you for an inheritance  according 
to your tribes  these nations that 
remain  from the jordan  with all the 
nations that i have cut off  even unto 
the great sea toward the going down 
of the sun  5and t he lord your god  
he shall thrust them out from before 
you and drive them from out of your sight  and ye shall possess their land  
as the lord your god spoke unto you  
6therefore be ye very courageous to 
keep and to do all that is written in the 
book of t he law of moses  that ye turn 
not aside therefrom to the right hand or 
to the left  7that ye come not among 
these nations  these that remain among 
you neither make mention of the 
name of their gods  nor cause to swear 
by them  neither serve them  nor 
wors hip them  8but cleave unto the 
lord your god  as ye have done unto 
this day  9wherefore the lord hath 
driven out from before you great 
nations and mighty  but as for you  no 
man hath stood against you unto this 
day 10one man of you hath chased a 
thousand  for the lord your god  he it 
is that fought for you  as he spoke 
unto you  11take good heed therefore 
unto yourselves  that ye love the lord 
your god  12else if ye do in any wise 
go back  and cleave unto the remnant 
of these nations  even these that 
remai n among you  and make 
marriages with them  and go in unto 
them  and they to you  13know for a 
certainty that the lord your god will 
no more drive these nations from out 
of your sight  but they shall be a snare 
and a trap unto you  and a scourge in 
your sid es and pricks in your eyes  
until ye perish from off this good land 
which the lord your god hath given 
you 14and behold  this day i am 
going the way of all the earth  consider 
ye therefore in all your heart and in all 
your soul  that not one thing hath 23 joshua  
342 
 failed of all the good things which the 
lord your god spoke concerning you  
all are come to pass unto you  not one 
thing hath failed thereof  15and it shall 
come to pass  that as all the good 
things are come upon you of which the 
lord your god spoke unto y ou so 
shall the lord bring upon you all the 
evil things  until he have destroyed 
you from off this good land which the 
lord your god hath given you  
16when ye transgress the covenant of 
the lord your god  which he 
commanded you  and go and serve 
other god s and worship them  then 
shall the anger of the lord be kindled 
against you  and ye shall perish 
quickly from off the good land which 
he hath given unto you   
and joshua gathered all the 
tribes of israel to shechem  
and called for the elders of israel  and 
for their heads  and for their judges  
and for their officers  and they 
presented themselves before god  
2and joshua said unto all the people  
thus saith the lord the god of 
israel  your fathers dwelt of old time 
beyond the river  even terah  the 
father of abraham  and the father of 
nahor  and they served other gods  
3and i took your father abraham from 
beyond the river  and led him 
throughout all the land of canaan  and 
multiplied his seed  and gave him 
isaac  4and i gave unto isaac jacob 
and esau  and i gave unto esau mount 
seir to possess it  and jacob and his 
children went down into egypt  5and i sent moses and aaron  and i plagued 
egypt  according to that which i did in 
the midst thereof  and afterward i 
brought you out  6and i brought your 
fathers out of egypt  and ye came unto 
the sea  and the egyptians pursued 
after your fathers with chariots and 
with horsemen unto the red sea  7and 
when they cried out unto the lord he 
put darkness between you and the 
egyptians  and brought the sea upon 
them  and covered them  and your eyes 
saw what i did in egypt  and ye dwelt 
in the wilderness many days  8and i 
brought you into the land of the 
amorites  that dwelt beyond the 
jordan  and they fought with you  and 
i gave them into your hand  and ye 
possessed their land  and i destroyed 
them from before you  9then balak the 
son of zippor  king of moab  arose and 
fought against israel  and he sent and 
called balaam the son of beor to curse 
you 10but i would not hearken unto 
balaam  therefore he even blessed 
you so i delivered you out of his hand  
11and ye went over the jordan  and 
came unto jericho  and the men of 
jericho fought against you  the 
amorite  and the perizzite  and the 
canaanite  and the hittite  and the 
girgashite  the hivite  and the 
jebusite  and i delivered them into 
your hand  12and i sent the hornet 
before you  which drove them out 
from before you  even the two kings of 
the amorites  not with thy sword  nor 
with thy bow  13and i gave you a land 
whereon thou hadst not laboured  and 24 joshua  
343 
 cities which ye built not  and ye dwell 
therein  of vineyards and olive yards 
which ye planted not do ye eat  14now 
therefore fear the lord and serve him 
in sincerity and in truth  and put away 
the gods which your fathers served 
beyond the river  and in egypt  and 
serve ye the lord 15and if it seem evil 
unto you to serve the lord choose you 
this day whom ye will serve  whether 
the gods which your fathers served 
that were beyond the river  or the 
gods of the amorites  in whose land ye 
dwell  but as for me and my house  we 
will serve the lord  
16and the people answered and said  
far be it from us that we should 
forsake the lord to serve other gods  
17for the lord our god  he it is that 
brought us and our fathers up out of 
the land of egypt  from the house of 
bondage  and that did those great signs 
in our sight  and preserved us in all the 
way wherein we went  and among all 
the peoples through the midst of whom 
we passed  18and the lord drove out 
from before us all the peoples  even 
the amorites that dwelt in the land  
therefore we also will serve the lord 
for he is our god   
19and joshua said unto the people  
ye cannot serve the lord for he is a 
holy god  he is a jealous god  he will 
not forgive your transgression nor your 
sins 20if ye forsake the lord and 
serve  strange gods  then he will turn 
and do you evil  and consume you  
after that he hath done you good   21and the people said unto joshua  
nay but we will serve the lord 
22and joshua said unto the people  ye 
are witnesses against yourselves that 
ye hav e chosen you the lord to serve 
himand they said  we are 
witnesses  23now therefore put 
away the strange gods which are 
among you  and incline your heart 
unto the lord the god of israel  
24and the people said unto joshua  
the lord our god will we s erve and 
unto his voice will we hearken   
25so joshua made a covenant with 
the people that day  and set them a 
statute and an ordinance in shechem  
26and joshua wrote these words in the 
book of the law of god  and he took a 
great stone  and set it up the re under 
the oak that was by the sanctuary of 
the lord 27and joshua said unto all 
the people  behold  this stone shall be 
a witness against us  for it hath heard 
all the words of the lord which he 
spoke unto us  it shall be therefore a 
witness against yo u lest ye deny your 
god 28so joshua sent the people 
away  every man unto his inheritance   
29and it came to pass after these 
things  that joshua the son of nun  the 
servant of the lord died being a 
hundred and ten years old  30and they 
buried him in t he border of his 
inheritance in timnath serah  which is 
in the hill country of ephraim  on the 
north of the mountain of gaash  31and 
israel served the lord all the days of 
joshua  and all the days of the elders 
that outlived joshua  and had known joshua  
344 
 all the w ork of the lord that he had 
wrought for israel  32and the bones of 
joseph  which the children of israel 
brought up out of egypt  buried they in 
shechem  in the parcel of ground 
which jacob bought of the sons of 
hamor the father of shechem for a hundred pi eces of money  and they 
became the inheritance of the children 
of joseph  33and eleazar the son of 
aaron died  and they buried him in the 
hill of phinehas his son  which was 
given him in mount ephraim    
345 
   
judges  
 
and it came to pass after the 
death of joshua  that the children 
of israel asked the lord saying  who 
shall go up for us first against the 
canaanites  to fight against them  
2and lord said judah shall go up  
behold  i have delivered the land into 
his hand  3and judah said unto 
simeon  his brother  come up with me 
into my lot  that we may fight against 
the canaanites  and i likewise will go 
with thee into thy lot  so simeon 
went with him  4and judah went up  
and the lord delivered the canaanites 
and the perizzites into their hand  and 
they smote of them in bezek ten 
thousand men  5and they found 
adoni bezek in bezek  and they 
fought against him  and they smote the 
canaanites and the perizzites  6but 
adoni bezek fled  and they pursued 
after him  and caught him  and cut off 
his thumbs an d his great toes  7and 
adoni bezek said  threescore and ten 
kings  having their thumbs and their 
great toes cut off  gathered food under 
my table  as i have done  so god hath 
requited me  and they brought him to 
jerusalem  and he died there   
8and the ch ildren of judah fought 
jerusalem  and took it  and smote it 
with the edge of the sword  and set the 
city on fire  9and afterward the 
children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites that dwelt in the 
hillcountry  and in the south  and in 
the lo wland  10and judah went 
against the canaanites that dwelt in 
hebron now the name of hebron 
beforetime was kiriath arbaand they 
smote sheshai  and ahiman  and 
talmai  11and from thence he went 
against the inhabitants of debir now 
the name of debir beforeti me was 
kiriath sepher  12and caleb said  he 
that smiteth kiriath sepher  and taketh 
it to him will i give achsah my 
daughter to wife  13and othniel the 
son of kenaz  caleb s younger 
brother  took it  and he gave him 
achsah his daughter to wife  14and it  
came to pass  when she came unto 
him that she moved him to ask of her 
father a field  and she alighted from 
off her ass  and caleb said unto her  
what wouldest thou  15and she said 
unto him  give me a blessing  for that 
thou hast set me in the southla nd give 
me therefore springs of water  and 
caleb gave her the upper springs and 
the nether springs   
16and the children of the kenite  
moses father inlaw went up out of 
the city of palm trees with the children 
of judah into the wilderness of judah  
which is in the south of arad  and they 
went and dwelt with the people  17and 
judah went with simeon his brother  1 judges  
346 
 and they smote the canaanites that 
inhabited zephath  and utterly 
destroyed it  and the name of the city 
was called hormah  18also judah took 
gaza with the border thereof  and 
ashkelon with the border thereof  and 
ekron with the border thereof  19and 
the lord was with judah  and he drove 
out the inhabitants of the hill country  
for he could not drive out the 
inhabitants of the valley  because they 
had chariots of iron  20and they gave 
hebron unto caleb  as moses had 
spoken  and he drove out thence the 
three sons of anak  21and the children 
of benjamin did not drive out the 
jebusites that inhabited jerusalem  but 
the jebusites dwelt with the children  of 
benjamin in jerusalem  unto this day   
22and the house of joseph  they also 
went up against beth el and the lord 
was with them  23and the house of 
joseph sent to spy out beth elnow 
the name of the city beforetime was 
luz 24and the watchers saw a man  
come forth out of the city  and they 
said unto him  show us  we pray thee  
the entrance into the city  and we will 
deal kindly with thee  25and he 
showed them the entrance into the city  
and they smote the city with the edge 
of the sword  but they let t he man go 
and all his family  26and the man went 
into the land of the hittites  and built a 
city and called the name thereof luz  
which is the name thereof unto this 
day  
27and manasseh did not drive out 
the inhabitants of beth shean and its towns  nor o f taanach and its towns  
nor the inhabitants of dor and its 
towns  nor the inhabitants of ibleam 
and its towns  nor the inhabitants of 
megiddo and its towns  but the 
canaanites were resolved to dwell in 
that land  28and it came to pass  when 
israel was wax en strong  that they put 
the canaanites to task work  but did in 
no wise drive them out   
29and ephraim drove not out the 
canaanites that dwelt in gezer  but the 
canaanites dwelt in gezer among 
them   
30zebulun drove not out the 
inhabitants of kitron  nor the 
inhabitants of nahalol  but the 
canaanites dwelt among them  and 
became tributary   
31asher drove not out the inhabitants 
of acco  nor the inhabitants of zidon  
nor of ahlab  nor of achzib  nor of 
helbah  nor of aphik  nor of rehob  
32but the asherite s dwelt among the 
canaanites  the inhabitants of the land  
for they did not drive them out   
33naphtali drove not out the 
inhabitants of beth shemesh  nor the 
inhabitants of beth anath  but he dwelt 
among the canaanites  the inhabitants 
of the land  nevert heless the 
inhabitants of beth shemesh and of 
beth anath became tributary unto 
them   
34and the amorites forced the 
children of dan into the hill country  
for they would not suffer them to come 
down to the valley  35but the amorites 
were resolved to dwell in harheres  in judges  
347 
 aijalon  and in shaalbim  yet the hand 
of the house of joseph prevailed  so 
that they became tributary  36and the 
border of the amorites was from the 
ascent of akrabbim  from sela  and 
upward   
and the angel of the lord came 
up from gilga l to bochim  and 
he said     i made you to go up out 
of egypt  and have brought you unto 
the land which i swore unto your 
fathers  and i said  i will never break 
my covenant with you  2and ye shall 
make no covenant with the inhabitants 
of this land  ye shall break down their 
altars  but ye have not hearkened unto 
my voice  what is this ye have done  
3wherefore i also said  i will not drive 
them out from before you  but they 
shall be unto you as snares  and their 
gods shall be a trap unto you  4and it 
came to pass  when the angel of the 
lord spoke these words unto all the 
children of israel  that the people lifted 
up their voice  and wept  5and they 
called the name of that place abochim  
and they sacrificed there unto the 
lord  
6now when joshua had sent  the 
people away  the children of israel 
went every man unto his inheritance to 
possess the land  7and the people 
served the lord all the days of joshua  
and all the days of the elders that 
outlived joshua  who had seen all the 
great work of the lord that he had 
wrought for israel  8and joshua the 
                                                      
a that is weepers  son of nun  the servant of the lord 
died being a hundred and ten years 
old 9and they buried him in the 
border of his inheritance in timnath 
heres  in the hill country of ephraim  
on the north of the mountain o f gaash  
10and also all that generation were 
gathered unto their fathers  and there 
arose another generation after them  
that knew not the lord nor yet the 
work which he had wrought for israel   
11and the children of israel did that 
which was evil in the sight of the 
lord and served the baalim  12and 
they forsook the lord the god of their 
fathers  who brought them out of the 
land of egypt  and followed other 
gods  of the gods of the peoples that 
were round about them  and 
worshipped them  and they provok ed 
the lord 13and they forsook the lord 
and served baal and the ashtaroth  
14and the anger of the lord was 
kindled against israel  and he 
delivered them into the hands of 
spoilers that spoiled them  and he 
gave them over into the hands of their 
enemies r ound about  so that they 
could not any longer stand before their 
enemies  15whithersoever they went 
out the hand of the lord was against 
them for evil  as the lord had spoken  
and as the lord had sworn unto them  
and they were sore distressed  16and 
the lord raised up judges  who saved 
them out of the hand of those that 
spoiled them  17and yet they 
hearkened not unto their judges  for 
they went astray after other gods  and 2 judges  
348 
 worshipped them  they turned aside 
quickly out of the way wherein their 
fathers walk ed obeying the 
commandments of the lord they did 
not so  18and when the lord raised 
them up judges  then the lord was 
with the judge  and saved them out of 
the hand of their enemies all the days 
of the judge  for it repented the lord 
because of their gro aning by reason of 
them that oppressed them and crushed 
them  19but it came to pass  when the 
judge was dead  that they turned back  
and dealt more corruptly than their 
fathers  in following other gods to 
serve them  and to worship them  they 
left nothing undone of their practices  
nor of their stubborn way  20and the 
anger of the lord was kindled against 
israel  and he said  because this 
nation have transgressed my covenant 
which i commanded their fathers  and 
have not hearkened unto my voice  21i 
also wi ll not henceforth drive out any 
from before them of the nations that 
joshua left when he died  22that by 
them i may prove israel  whether they 
will keep the way of the lord to walk 
therein  as their fathers did keep it  or 
not 23so the lord left those na tions  
without driving them out hastily  
neither delivered he them into the 
hand of joshua   
now these are the nations which 
the lord left to prove israel by 
them  even as many as had not known 
all the wars of canaan  2only that the 
generations of the c hildren of israel 
might know  to teach them war  at the least such as beforetime knew nothing 
thereof  3namely  the five lords of the 
philistines  and all the canaanites  and 
the zidonians  and the hivites that 
dwelt in mount lebanon  from mount 
baalhermo n unto the entrance of 
hamath  4and they were there  to 
prove israel by them  to know whether 
they would hearken unto the 
commandments of the lord which he 
commanded their fathers by the hand 
of moses  5and the children of israel 
dwelt among the canaanite s the 
hittites  and the amorites  and the 
perizzites  and the hivites  and the 
jebusites  6and they took their 
daughters to be their wives  and gave 
their own daughters to their sons  and 
served their gods   
7and the children of israel did that 
which was evil in the sight of the 
lord and forgot the lord their god  
and served the baalim and the 
asheroth  8therefore the anger of the 
lord was kindled against israel  and 
he gave them over into the hand of 
cushan rishathaim king of aram 
naharaim  and the child ren of israel 
served cushan rishathaim eight years  
9and when the children of israel cried 
unto the lord the lord raised up a 
saviour to the children of israel  who 
saved them  even othniel the son of 
kenaz  caleb s younger brother  10and 
the spirit of th e lord came upon him  
and he judged israel  and he went out 
to war  and the lord delivered 
cushan rishathaim king of aram into 
his hand  and his hand prevailed 3 judges  
349 
 against cushan rishathaim  11and the 
land had rest forty years  and othniel 
the son of kenaz die d  
12and the children of israel again 
did that which was evil in the sight of 
the lord and the lord strengthened 
eglon the king of moab against israel  
because they had done that which was 
evil in the sight of the lord 13and he 
gathered unto him the chi ldren of 
ammon and amalek  and he went and 
smote israel  and they possessed the 
city of palm trees  14and the children 
of israel served eglon the king of 
moab eighteen years  15but when the 
children of israel cried unto the lord 
the lord raised them up a saviour  
ehud the son of gera  the benjamite  a 
man left handed  and the children of 
israel sent a present by him unto eglon 
the king of moab  16and ehud made 
him a sword which had two edges  of a 
cubit length  and he girded it under his 
raiment upon his r ight thigh  17and he 
offered the present unto eglon king of 
moab now eglon was a very fat 
man 18and when he had made an end 
of offering the present  he sent away 
the people that bore the present  19but 
he himself turned back from the 
quarries that were by  gilgal  and said  
i have a secret errand unto thee  o 
king and he said  keep silence  
and all that stood by him went out 
from him  20and ehud came unto him  
and he was sitting by himself alone in 
his cool upper chamber  and ehud 
said i have a messa ge from god unto 
thee and he arose out of his seat  21and ehud put forth his left hand  and 
took the sword from his right thigh  
and thrust it into his belly  22and the 
haft also went in after the blade  and 
the fat closed upon the blade  for he 
drew not  the sword out of his belly  
and it came out behind  23then ehud 
went forth into the porch  and shut the 
doors of the upper chamber upon him  
and locked them  24now when he was 
gone out  his servants came  and they 
saw and behold  the doors of the 
upper chamber were locked  and they  
said surely he is covering his feet in 
the cabinet of the cool chamber  
25and they tarried till they were 
ashamed  and behold  he opened not 
the doors of the upper chamber  
therefore they took the key  and 
opened them  and behold  their lord 
was fallen down dead on the earth  
26and ehud escaped while they 
lingered  having passed beyond the 
quarries  and escaped unto seirah  
27and it came to pass  when he was 
come  that he blew a horn in the hill 
country of ephraim  and th e children 
of israel went down with him from the 
hillcountry  and he before them  
28and he said unto them  follow after 
me for the lord hath delivered your 
enemies the moabites into your hand  
and they went down after him  and 
took the fords of the jor dan against the 
moabites  and suffered not a man to 
pass over  29and they smote of moab 
at that time about ten thousand men  
every lusty man  and every man of 
valour  and there escaped not a man  judges  
350 
 30so moab was subdued that day under 
the hand of israel  and the land had 
rest fourscore years   
31and after him was shamgar the 
son of anath  who smote of the 
philistines six hundred men with an 
oxgoad  and he also saved israel   
and the children of israel again 
did that which was evil in the 
sight of the lord when ehud was 
dead  2and the lord gave them over 
into the hand of jabin king of canaan  
that reigned in hazor  the captain of 
whose host was sisera  who dwelt in 
harosheth goiim  3and the children of 
israel cried unto the lord for he had 
nine hundred cha riots of iron  and 
twenty years he mightily oppressed the 
children of israel   
4now deborah  a prophetess  the 
wife of lappidoth  she judged israel at 
that time  5and she sat under the palm 
tree of deborah between ramah and 
beth el in the hill country of e phraim  
and the children of israel came up to 
her for judgment  6and she sent and 
called barak the son of abinoam out 
of kedesh naphtali  and said unto him  
hath not the lord the god of israel  
commanded  saying  go and draw 
toward mount tabor  and take with 
thee ten thousand men of the children 
of naphtali and of the children of 
zebulun  7and i will draw unto thee to 
the brook kishon sisera  the captain of 
jabin s army  with his chariots and his 
multitude  and i will deliver him into 
thy hand  8and barak  said unto her  if 
thou wilt go with me  then i will go  but if thou wilt not go with me  i will 
not go  9and she said  i will surely 
go with thee  notwithstanding the 
journey that thou takest shall not be for 
thy honour  for the lord will give 
sisera o ver into the hand of a woman  
and deborah arose  and went with 
barak to kedesh  10and barak called 
zebulun and naphtali together to 
kedesh  and there went up ten 
thousand men at his feet  and deborah 
went up with him   
11now heber the kenite had severed 
himself from the kenites  even from 
the children of hobab the father inlaw 
of moses  and had pitched his tent as 
far as elon bezaanannim  which is by 
kedesh   
12and they told sisera that barak the 
son of abinoam was gone up to mount 
tabor  13and sisera gat hered together 
all his chariots  even nine hundred 
chariots of iron  and all the people that 
were with him  from harosheth goiim  
unto the brook kishon  14and deborah 
said unto barak  up for this is the 
day in which the lord hath delivered 
sisera into th y hand  is not the lord 
gone out before thee  so barak went 
down from mount tabor  and ten 
thousand men after him  15and the 
lord discomfited sisera  and all his 
chariots  and all his host  with the edge 
of the sword before barak  and sisera 
alighted from  his chariot  and fled 
away on his feet  16but barak pursued 
after the chariots  and after the host  
unto harosheth goiim  and all the host 4 judges  
351 
 of sisera fell by the edge of the sword  
there was not a man left   
17howbeit sisera fled away on his 
feet to the te nt of jael the wife of 
heber the kenite  for there was peace 
between jabin the king of hazor and 
the house of heber the kenite  18and 
jael went out to meet sisera  and said 
unto him  turn in  my lord  turn in to 
me fear not  and he turned in unto 
her in to the tent  and she covered him 
with a rug  19and he said unto her  
give me  i pray thee  a little water to 
drink  for i am thirsty  and she 
opened a bottle of milk  and gave him 
drink  and covered him  20and he said 
unto her  stand in the door of the tent 
and it shall be  when any man doth 
come and inquire of thee  and say  is 
there any man here  that thou shalt 
say no 21then jael heber s wife 
took a tent pin and took a hammer in 
her hand  and went softly unto him  
and smote the pin into his templ es and 
it pierced through into the ground  for 
he was in a deep sleep  so he swooned 
and died  22and behold  as barak 
pursued sisera  jael came out to meet 
him and said unto him  come  and i 
will show thee the man whom thou 
seekest  and he came unto h er and 
behold  sisera lay dead  and the tent 
pin was in his temples  23so god 
subdued on that day jabin the king of 
canaan before the children of israel  
24and the hand of the children of israel 
prevailed more and more against jabin 
the king of canaan  until they had 
destroyed jabin king of canaan    
then sang deborah and barak the 
son of abinoam on that day  
saying   
2when men let grow their hair in 
israel   
when the people offer themselves 
willingly   
bless ye the lord  
3hear  o ye kings  give ear  o ye 
princes   
i unto the lord will i sing   
i will sing praise to the lord the 
god of israel   
 
4lord when thou didst go forth out 
of  
seir  
when thou didst march out of the 
field of edom   
the earth trembled  the heavens also 
dropped   
yea the clouds  dropped water   
5the mountains quaked at the 
presence of the lord  
even yon sinai at the presence of 
the lord the god of israel   
 
6in the days of shamgar the son of 
anath   
in the days of jael  the highways 
ceased   
and the travellers walked through 
byways   
7the rulers ceased in israel  they 
ceased   
until that thou didst arise  deborah   
that thou didst arise a mother in 
israel   5 judges  
352 
 8they chose new gods   
then was war in the gates   
was there a shield or spear seen  
among forty thousand in israel   
 
9my heart is toward the governors of  
israel   
that offered themselves willingly 
among the people   
bless ye the lord  
10ye that ride on white asses   
ye that sit on rich cloths   
and ye that walk by the way  tell of 
it  
11louder than the voice of archers  
by the watering troughs   
there shall they rehearse the 
righteous acts of the lord  
even the righteous acts of his rulers 
in israel   
then the people of the lord went 
down to the gates   
 
12awake  awake  deborah

arise barak  and lead thy captivity  
 captive  thou son of abinoam   
13then made he a remnant to have  
 dominion over the nobles and the 
people   
the lord made me have dominion 
over the mighty   
14out of ephraim came they whose 
root is in amalek   
after thee  benjamin  among thy 
peoples   
out of machir came down 
governors   and out of zebulun they that handle 
the marshal s staff   
15and the princes of issachar were 
with  
deborah   
as was issachar  so was barak   
into the valley they rushed forth at 
his feet   
among the divisions of reuben  
there were great resolves of heart   
16why sattest thou among the sheep 
folds  
to hear the pipings for the flocks   
at the divisions of reuben  
there were great searchings of 
heart   
17gilead abode beyond the jordan   
and dan  why dot h he sojourn by 
the ships   
asher dwelt at the shore of the sea   
and abideth by its bays   
18zebulun is a people that jeoparded 
their lives unto the death   
and naphtali  upon the high places 
of the field   
 
19the kings came  they fought   
then fought the  kings of canaan   
in taanach by the waters of 
megiddo   
they took no gain of money   
20they fought from heaven   
the stars in their courses fought 
against sisera

22then did the horsehoofs stamp  
by reason of the prancings  the 
prancings of their mighty ones   
23curse ye meroz  said the angel 
of the lord  
curse ye bitterly the inhabitants 
thereof   
because they came not to the help

dead   
 
28through the window she looked 
forth  and peered

a spoil of dyed garments of

31so perish all thine enemies  o 
lord  
but they that love him be as the sun 
when he goeth forth in his might   
and the land had rest forty years   
and the children of israel did that 
which was evil in the sight of the 
lord and the lord delivered them 
into the hand of midian seven years  
2and the hand of midian prevailed 
against israel  and because of midian 
the children of israel made them the 
dens which are in the mountains  and 
the caves  and the strongholds  3and so 
it was  when israel had sown  that the 
midianites came up  and the 
amalekites  and the children of the 
east they came up against them  4and 
they encamped against them  and 
destroyed the produce of the earth  till 
thou come unto gaza  and left no 
sustenance in israel  neither sheep  nor 6 judges  
354 
 ox nor ass  5for they came up with 
their cattle and their tents  and they 
came in as locusts for multitude  both 
they and their camels were without 
number  and they came into the land to 
destroy it  6and israel was bro ught 
very low because of midian  and the 
children of israel cried unto the lord  
7and it came to pass  when the 
children of israel cried unto the lord 
because of midian  8that the lord sent 
a prophet unto the children of israel  
and he said unto them  thus saith the 
lord the god of israel  i brought you 
up from egypt  and brought you forth 
out of the house of bondage  9and i 
delivered you out of the hand of the 
egyptians  and out of the hand of all 
that oppressed you  and drove them 
out from before you  and gave you 
their land  10and i said unto you  i am 
the lord your god  ye shall not fear 
the gods of the amorites  in whose 
land ye dwell  but ye have not 
hearkened unto my voice   
11and the angel of the lord came  
and sat under the terebinth which was 
in ophrah  that belonged unto joash 
the abiezrite  and his son gideon was 
beating out wheat in the winepress  to 
hide it from the midianites  12and the 
angel of the lord appeared unto him  
and said unto him  the lord is with 
thee thou mighty man of valour  
13and gideon said unto him  oh my 
lord if the lord be with us  why then 
is all this befallen us  and where are 
all his wondrous works which our 
fathers told us of  saying  did not the lord bring us up from egypt  but now 
the lord hath cast us off  and 
delivered us into the hand of midian  
14and the lord turned towards him  
and said  go in this thy might  and 
save israel from the hand of midian  
have not i sent thee  15and he said 
unto him  oh my lord  wherewith 
shall i save israel  behold  my fam ily 
is the poorest in manasseh  and i am 
the least in my father s house  16and 
the lord said unto him  surely i will 
be with thee  and thou shalt smite the 
midianites as one man  17and he said 
unto him  if now i have found favour 
in thy sight  then sho w me a sign that 
it is thou that talkest with me  18depart 
not hence  i pray thee  until i come 
unto thee  and bring forth my present  
and lay it before thee  and he said  i 
will tarry until thou come back  19and 
gideon went in  and made ready a kid  
and unleavened cakes of an ephah of 
meal  the flesh he put in a basket  and 
he put the broth in a pot  and brought it 
out unto him under the terebinth  and 
presented it  20and the angel of god 
said unto him  take the flesh and the 
unleavened cakes  and lay them upon 
this rock  and pour out the broth  and 
he did so  21then the angel of the lord 
put forth the end of the staff that was 
in his hand  and touched the flesh and 
the unleavened cakes  and there went 
up fire out of the rock  and consumed 
the flesh an d the unleavened cakes  
and the angel of the lord departed out 
of his sight  22and gideon saw that he 
was the angel of the lord and gideon judges  
355 
 said alas o lord g od forasmuch as 
i have seen the angel of the lord face 
to face  23and the lord said unto him  
peace be unto thee  fear not  thou 
shalt not die  24then gideon built an 
altar there unto the lord and called it 
aadonai shalom  unto this day it is 
yet in ophrah of the abiezrites   
25and it came to pass the same 
night  that the lord said unto him  
take thy father s bullock  and the 
second bullock of seven years old  and 
throw down the altar of baal that thy 
father hath  and cut down the asherah 
that is by it  26and build an altar unto 
the lord thy god upon the top of this 
stronghold  in the ordered  place  and 
take the second bullock  and offer a 
burnt offering with the wood of the 
asherah which thou shalt cut down  
27then gideon took ten men of his 
servants  and did as the lord had 
spoken unto him  and it came to pass  
because he feared his father s 
household and the men of the city  so 
that he could not do it by day  that he 
did it by night  28and when the men of 
the city arose early in the morning  
behold  the altar of baal was broken 
down  and the asherah was cut down 
that was by it  and the seco nd bullock 
was offered upon the altar that was 
built 29and they said one to another  
who hath done this thing  and when 
they inquired and asked  they said  
gideon the son of joash hath done 
this thing  30then the men of the city 
                                                      
a that is the lord is peace  said unto joash  bring out thy son  
that he may die  because he hath 
broken down the altar of baal  and 
because he hath cut down the asherah 
that was by it  31and joash said unto 
all that stood against him  will ye 
contend for baal  or will ye save him  
he that will contend for him  shall be 
put to death before morning  if he be a 
god let him contend for himself  
because one hath broken down his 
altar 32therefore on that day he was 
called bjerubbaal  saying  let baal 
contend against him  because he hath 
broken down his al tar  
33now all the midianites and the 
amalekites and the children of the east 
assembled themselves together  and 
they passed over  and pitched in the 
valley of jezreel  34but the spirit of the 
lord clothed gideon  and he blew a 
horn and abiezer was gath ered 
together after him  35and he sent 
messengers throughout all manasseh  
and they also were gathered together 
after him  and he sent messengers unto 
asher  and unto zebulun  and unto 
naphtali  and they came up to meet 
them  36and gideon said unto god  if 
thou wilt save israel by my hand  as 
thou hast spoken  37behold  i will put 
a fleece of wool on the threshing floor  
if there be dew on the fleece only  and 
it be dry upon all the ground  then 
shall i know that thou wilt save israel 
by my hand  as thou h ast spoken  
38and it was so  for he rose up early on 
                                                      
b that is let baal contend  judges  
356 
 the morrow  and pressed the fleece 
together  and wrung dew out of the 
fleece  a bowlful of water  39and 
gideon said unto god  let not thine 
anger be kindled against me  and i will 
speak but this once  let me make trial  
i pray thee  but this once with the 
fleece  let it now be dry only upon the 
fleece  and upon all the ground let 
there be dew  40and god did so that 
night  for it was dry upon the fleece 
only and there was dew on all the 
ground   
then  jerubbaal  who is gideon  
and all the people that were with 
him rose up early  and pitched beside 
enharod  and the camp of midian was 
on the north side of them  by gibeath 
moreh  in the valley   
2and the lord said unto gideon  
the people that are with thee are too 
many for me to give the midianites 
into their hand  lest israel vaunt 
themselves against me  saying  mine 
own hand hath saved me  3now 
therefore make proclamation in the 
ears of the people  saying  whosoever 
is fearful and trembling  let him r eturn 
and depart early from mount gilead  
and there returned of the people 
twenty and two thousand  and there 
remained ten thousand   
4and the lord said unto gideon  
the people are yet too many  bring 
them down unto the water  and i will 
try them for the e there  and it shall be  
that of whom i say to thee  this shall 
go with thee  the same shall go with 
thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee  the 
same shall not go  5so he brought 
down the people unto the water  and 
the lord said unto gideon  everyone 
that lappeth of the water with his 
tongue  as a dog lappeth  him shalt 
thou set by himself  likewise every one 
that boweth down upon his knees to 
drink  6and the number of them that 
lapped  putting their hand to their 
mouth  was three hundred men  but all 
the rest of the people bowed down 
upon their knees to drink water  7and 
the lord said unto gideon  by the 
three hundred men that lapped will i 
save you  and deliver the midianites 
into thy hand  and let all the people go 
every  man unto his place  8so they 
took the victuals of the people in their 
hand  and their horns  and he sent all 
the men of israel every man unto his 
tent but retained the three hundred 
men and the camp of midian was 
beneath him in the valley   
9and it cam e to pass the same night  
that the lord said unto him  arise  get 
thee down upon the camp  for i have 
delivered it into thy hand  10but if thou 
fear to go down  go thou with purah 
thy servant down to the camp  11and 
thou shalt hear what they say  and 
afterward shall thy hands be 
strengthened to go down upon the 
camp  then went he down with purah 
his servant unto the outermost part of 
the armed men that were in the camp  
12now the midianites and the 
amalekites and all the children of the 
east lay along in the valley like locusts 7 judges  
357 
 for multitude  and their camels were 
without number  as the sand which is 
upon the sea shore for multitude  
13and when gideon was come  behold  
there was a man telling a dream unto 
his follow  and saying  behold  i 
dreamed a dream  and lo a cake of 
barley bread tumbled into the camp of 
midian  and came unto the tent  and 
smote it that it fell  and turned it 
upside down  that the tent lay flat  
14and his fellow answered and said  
this is nothing else save the sword of 
gideon the son of joash  a man of 
israel  into his hand god hath 
delivered midian  and all the host   
15and it was so  when gideon heard 
the telling of the dream  and the 
interpretation thereof  that he 
worshipped  and he returned into the 
camp of israel  and said  arise  for 
the lord hath delivered into your hand 
the host of midian  16and he divided 
the three hundred men into three 
companies  and he put into the hands 
of all of them horns  and empty 
pitchers  with torches within the 
pitchers  17and he said unto th em 
look on me  and do likewise  and 
behold  when i come to the outermost 
part of the camp  it shall be that  as i 
do so shall ye do  18when i blow the 
horn i and all that are with me  then 
blow ye the horns also on every side of 
all the camp  and say  for the lord 
and for gideon    
19so gideon  and the hundred men 
that were with him  came unto the 
outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch  when 
they had but newly set the watch  and 
they blew the horns  and broke in 
pieces the pit chers that were in their 
hands  20and the three companies blew 
the horns  and broke the pitchers  and 
held the torches in their left hands  and 
the horns in their right hands 
wherewith to blow  and they cried  
the sword for the lord and for 
gideon   21and they stood every man 
in his place round about the camp  and 
all the host ran  and they shouted  and 
fled 22and they blew the three 
hundred horns  and the lord set every 
mans sword a against his fellow  even 
throughout all the host  and the host 
fled as  far as beth shittah toward 
zererah  as far as the border of abel 
meholah  by tabbath  23and the men 
of israel were gathered together out of 
naphtali  and out of asher  and out of 
all manasseh  and pursued after 
midian  24and gideon sent messengers 
through out all the hill country of 
ephraim  saying  come down against 
midian  and take before them the 
waters  as far as beth barah  and also 
the jordan  so all the men of ephraim 
were gathered together  and took the 
waters as far as beth barah  and also 
the jo rdan 25and they took the two 
princes of midian  oreb and zeeb  and 
they slew oreb at the rock of oreb  
and zeeb they slew at the winepress 
of zeeb  and pursued midian  and they 
brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to 
gideon beyond the jordan   judges  
358 
 and the men  of ephraim said 
unto him  why hast thou served 
us thus  that thou didst not call us 
when thou wentest to fight with 
midian  and they did chide with him 
sharply  2and he said unto them  
what have i now done in comparison 
with you  is not the gleaning of  
ephraim better than the vintage of 
abiezer  3god hath delivered into 
your hand the princes of midian  oreb 
and zeeb  and what was i able to do in 
comparison with you  then their 
anger was abated toward him  when he 
had said that   
4and gideon came to the  jordan  
and passed over  he and the three 
hundred men that were with him  faint 
yet pursuing  5and he said unto the 
men of succoth  give  i pray you  
loaves of bread unto the people that 
follow me  for they are faint  and i am 
pursuing after zebah and zalmunna  
the kings of midian  6and the princes 
of succoth said  are the hands of 
zebah and zalmunna now in thy 
power  that we should give bread unto 
thine army  7and gideon said  
therefore when the lord hath 
delivered zebah and zalmunna into 
my hand  then i will tear your flesh 
with the thorns of the wilderness and 
with briers  8and he went up thence to 
penuel  and spoke unto them in like 
manner  and the men of penuel 
answered him as the men of succoth 
had answered  9and he spoke also unto 
the men of penuel  saying  when i come back in peace  i will break down 
this tower   
10now zebah and zalmunna were in 
karkor  and their hosts with them  
about fifteen thousand men  all that 
were left of all the host of the children 
of the east  for there fell a hun dred and 
twenty thousand men that drew sword  
11and gideon went up by the way of 
them that dwelt in tents on the east of 
nobah and jogbehah  and smote the 
host for the host was secure  12and 
zebah and zalmunna fled  and he 
pursued after them  and he took the 
two kings of midian  zebah and 
zalmunna  and discomfited all the 
host 13and gideon the son of joash 
returned from the battle from the 
ascent of heres  14and he caught a 
young man of the men of succoth  and 
inquired of him  and he wrote down 
for him th e princes of succoth  and the 
elders thereof  seventy and seven men  
15and he came unto the men of 
succoth  and said  behold zebah and 
zalmunna  concerning whom ye did 
taunt me  saying  are the hands of 
zebah and zalmunna now in thy 
power  that we should give bread unto 
thy men that are weary  16and he 
took the elders of the city  and thorns 
of the wilderness and briers  and with 
them he taught the men of succoth  
17and he broke down the tower of 
penuel  and slew the men of the city  
18then said he unto z ebah and 
zalmunna  where are the men whom 
ye slew at tabor  and they answered  
as thou art  so were they  of one form 8 judges  
359 
 with the children of a king  19and he 
said they were my brethren  the sons 
of my mother  as the lord liveth  if ye 
had saved them al ive i would not slay 
you 20and he said unto jether his 
firstborn up and slay them  but the 
youth drew not his sword  for he 
feared  because he was yet a youth  
21then zebah and zalmunna said  
rise thou  and fall upon us  for as the 
man is  so is h is strength  and gideon 
arose  and slew zebah and zalmunna  
and took the crescents that were on 
their camels necks   
22then the men of israel said unto 
gideon  rule thou over us  both thou  
and thy son  and thy son s son also  for 
thou hast saved us out of the hand of 
midian  23and gideon said unto them  
i will not rule over you  neither shall 
my son rule over you  the lord shall 
rule over you  24and gideon said unto 
them  i would make a request of you  
that ye would give me every man the 
earrings of  his spoil for they had 
golden ear rings  because they were 
ishmaelites  25and they answered  we 
will willingly give them  and they 
spread a garment  and did cast therein 
every man the ear rings of his spoil  
26and the weight of the golden ear 
rings th at he requested was a thousand 
and seven hundred shekels of gold  
beside the crescents  and the pendants  
and the purple raiment that was on the 
kings of midian  and beside the chains 
that were about their camels necks  
27and gideon made an ephod thereof  
and put it in his city  even in ophrah  and all israel went astray after it there  
and it became a snare unto gideon  
and to his house  28so midian was 
subdued before the children of israel  
and they lifted up their heads no more  
and the land had rest for ty years in the 
days of gideon   
29and jerubbaal the son of joash 
went and dwelt in his own house  
30and gideon had threescore and ten 
sons of his body begotten  for he had 
many wives  31and his concubine that 
was in shechem  she also bore him a 
son and h e called his name 
abimelech  32and gideon the son of 
joash died in a good old age  and was 
buried in the sepulchre of joash his 
father  in ophrah of the abiezrites   
33and it came to pass  as soon as 
gideon was dead  that the children of 
israel again went astray after the 
baalim  and made baal berith their 
god 34and the children of israel 
remembered not the lord their god  
who had delivered them out of the 
hand of all their enemies on every 
side 35neither showed they kindness to 
the house of jerubbaal  namely 
gideon  according to all the goodness 
which he had shown unto israel   
and abimelech the son of 
jerubbaal went to shechem unto 
his mother s brethren  and spoke with 
them  and with all the family of the 
house of his mother s father  saying  
2speak  i pray you  in the ears of all 
the men of shechem  which is better 
for you  that all the sons of jerubbaal  
who are threescore and ten persons  9 judges  
360 
 rule over you  or that one rule over 
you remember also that i am your 
bone and your flesh  3and his 
mother s brethren spoke of him in the 
ears of all the men of shechem all 
these words  and their hearts inclined 
to follow abimelech  for they said  
he is our brother  4and they gave 
him threescore and ten pieces of silver 
out of the house of baal berith  
wherewith  abimelech hired vain and 
light fellows  who followed him  5and 
he went unto his father s house at 
ophrah  and slew his brethren the sons 
of jerubbaal  being threescore and ten 
persons  upon one stone  but jotham 
the youngest son of jerubbaal was left  
for he hid himself   
6and all the men of shechem 
assembled themselves together  and all 
beth millo  and went and made 
abimelech king  by the terebinth of 
the pillar that was in shechem  7and 
when they told it to jotham  he went 
and stood in the top of mount g erizim  
and lifted up his voice  and cried  and 
said unto them  hearken unto me  ye 
men of shechem  that god may 
hearken unto you  8the trees went 
forth on a time to anoint a king over 
them  and they said unto the olive tree 
reign thou over us  9but the olive tree 
said unto them  should i leave my 
fatness  seeing that by me they honour 
god and man  and go to hold sway 
over the trees  10and the trees said to 
the fig tree come thou  and reign over 
us 11but the fig tree said unto them  
should i leave my sw eetness  and my good fruitage  and go to hold sway 
over the trees  12and the trees said 
unto the vine  come thou  and reign 
over us  13and the vine said unto them  
should i leave my wine  which 
cheereth god and man  and go to hold 
sway over the trees  14then said all the 
trees unto the bramble  come thou  
and reign over us  15and the bramble 
said unto the trees  if in truth ye anoint 
me king over you  then come and take 
refuge in my shadow  and if not  let 
fire come out of the bramble  and 
devour the cedars  of lebanon  16now 
therefore  if ye have dealt truly and 
uprightly  in that ye have made 
abimelech king  and if ye have dealt 
well with jerubbaal and his house  and 
have done unto him according to the 
deserving of his hands 17for my 
father fought for you  and adventured 
his life  and delivered you out of the 
hand of midian  18and ye are risen up 
against my father s house this day  and 
have slain his sons  threescore and ten 
persons  upon one stone  and have 
made abimelech  the son of his maid 
servant  king over the men of 
shechem  because he is your brother 
19if ye then have dealt truly and 
uprightly with jerubbaal and with his 
house this day  then rejoice ye in 
abimelech  and let him also rejoice in 
you 20but if not  let fire come out 
from abimelech  and d evour the men 
of shechem  and beth millo  and let 
fire come out from the men of 
shechem  and from beth millo  and 
devour abimelech  21and jotham ran judges  
361 
 away  and fled  and went to beer  and 
dwelt there  for fear of abimelech his 
brother   
22and abimelech was  prince over 
israel three years  23and god sent an 
evil spirit between abimelech and the 
men of shechem  and the men of 
shechem dealt treacherously with 
abimelech  24that the violence done to 
the threescore and ten sons of 
jerubbaal might come  and that th eir 
blood might be laid upon abimelech 
their brother  who slew them  and 
upon the men of shechem  who 
strengthened his hands to slay his 
brethren  25and the men of shechem 
set liers inwait for him on the tops of 
the mountains  and they robbed all that 
came along that way by them  and it 
was told abimelech   
26and gaal the son of ebed came 
with his brethren  and went on to 
shechem  and the men of shechem put 
their trust in him  27and they went out 
into the field  and gathered their 
vineyards  and trod the g rapes  and 
held festival  and went into the house 
of their god  and did eat and drink  and 
cursed abimelech  28and gaal the son 
of ebed said  who is abimelech  and 
who is shechem  that we should serve 
him is not he the son of jerubbaal  
and zebul his off icer serve ye the 
men of hamor the father of shechem  
but why should we serve him  29and 
would that this people were under my 
hand  then would i remove 
abimelech  and he said to 
abimelech  increase thine army  and come out  30and when zebul the ruler 
of the city heard the words of gaal the 
son of ebed  his anger was kindled  
31and he sent messengers unto 
abimelech in tormah  saying  
behold  gaal the son of ebed and his 
brethren are come to shechem  and 
behold  they will incite the city against 
thee 32now therefore  up by night  
thou and the people that are with thee  
and lie in wait in the field  33and it 
shall be  that in the morning  as soon 
as the sun is up  thou shalt rise early  
and set upon the city  and behold  
when he and the people that are with 
him come out against thee  then 
mayest thou do to them as thou shalt 
be able   
34and abimelech rose up  and all 
the people that were with him  by 
night  and they lay in wait against 
shechem in four companies  35and 
gaal the son of ebed went out  and 
stood in the entrance of the gate of the 
city and abimelech rose up  and the 
people that were with him  from the 
ambushment  36and when gaal saw 
the people  he said to zebul  behold  
there come people down from the tops 
of the mountains  and zebul said 
unto him  thou seest the shadow of 
the mountains as if they were men  
37and gaal spoke again and said  see 
there come people down by the middle 
of the land  and one company cometh 
by the way of elon meonenim  38then 
said zebul unto him  where is now 
thy mouth  that thou saidst  who is 
abimelech  that we should serve him  judges  
362 
 is not this the people that thou hast 
despised  go out now  i pray  and fight 
with them  39and gaal went out 
before the men of shechem  and 
fought with abimelech  40and 
abimelech cha sed him  and he fled 
before him  and there fell many 
wounded  even unto the entrance of 
the gate  41and abimelech dwelt at 
arumah  and zebul drove out gaal 
and his brethren  that they should not 
dwell in shechem   
42and it came to pass on the 
morrow  that the people went out into 
the field  and it was told abimelech  
43and he took the people  and divided 
them into three companies  and lay in 
wait in the field  and he looked  and 
behold  the people were coming forth 
out of the city  and he rose up against 
them and smote them  44and 
abimelech  and the companies that 
were with him  rushed forward  and 
stood in the entrance of the gate of the 
city and the two companies rushed 
upon all that were in the field  and 
smote them  45and abimelech fought 
against the city all that day  and he 
took the city  and slew the people that 
were therein  and he beat down the 
city and sowed it with salt   
46and when all the men of the tower 
of shechem heard thereof  they 
entered into the hold of the house of 
elberith  47and it  was told abimelech 
that all the men of the tower of 
shechem were gathered together  
48and abimelech got him up to mount 
zalmon  he and all the people that were with him  and abimelech took an 
axe in his hand  and cut down a bough 
from the trees  and took it up and laid 
it on his shoulder  and he said unto the 
people that were with him  what ye 
have seen me do  make haste  and do 
as i have done  49and all the people 
likewise cut down every man his 
bough  and followed abimelech  and 
put them to the hold  and set the hold 
on fire upon them  so that all the men 
of the tower of shechem died also  
about a thousand men and women   
50then went abimelech to thebez  
and encamped against thebez  and 
took it  51but there was a strong tower 
within the city  and thith er fled all the 
men and women  even all they of the 
city and shut themselves in  and got 
them up to the roof of the tower  52and 
abimelech came unto the tower  and 
fought against it  and went close unto 
the door of the tower to burn it with 
fire 53and a certain woman cast an 
upper millstone upon abimelech s 
head  and broke his skull  54then he 
called hastily unto the young man his 
armour bearer  and said unto him  
draw thy sword  and kill me  that 
men say not of me  a woman slew 
him and his young man t hrust him 
through  and he died  55and when the 
men of israel saw that abimelech was 
dead  they departed every man unto his 
place  56thus god requited the 
wickedness of abimelech  which he 
did unto his father  in slaying his 
seventy brethren  57and all the 
wickedness of the men of shechem did judges  
363 
 god requite upon their heads  and 
upon them came the curse of jotham 
the son of jerubbaal   
and after abimelech there 
arose to save israel tola the 
son of puah  the son of dodo  a man of 
issachar  and he dwelt in sha mir in the 
hillcountry of ephraim  2and he 
judged israel twenty and three years  
and died  and was buried in shamir   
3and after him arose jair  the 
gileadite  and he judged israel twenty 
and two years  4and he had thirty sons 
that rode on thirty ass colt s and they 
had thirty cities  which are called 
ahavvoth jair unto this day  which are 
in the land of gilead  5and jair died  
and was buried in kamon   
6and the children of israel again did 
that which was evil in the sight of the 
lord and served the baali m and the 
ashtaroth  and the gods of aram  and 
the gods of zidon  and the gods of 
moab  and the gods of the children of 
ammon  and the gods of the 
philistines  and they forsook the lord 
and served him not  7and the anger of 
the lord was kindled against i srael  
and he gave them over into the hand 
of the philistines  and into the hand of 
the children of ammon  8and they 
oppressed and crushed the children of 
israel that year  eighteen years 
oppressed they  all the children of 
israel that were beyond the jor dan in 
the land of the amorites  which is in 
gilead  9and the children of ammon 
                                                      
a that is the villages of jair  passed over the jordan to fight also 
against judah  and against benjamin  
and against the house of ephraim  so 
that israel was sore distressed  10and 
the children of israel cri ed unto the 
lord saying  we have sinned against 
thee  in that we have forsaken our 
god and have served the baalim  
11and the lord said unto the children 
of israel  did not i save you from the 
egyptians  and from the amorites  
from the children of ammo n and from 
the philistines  12the zidonians also  
and the amalekites  and the maonites  
did oppress you  and ye cried unto me  
and i saved you out of their hand  
13yet ye have forsaken me  and served 
other gods  wherefore i will save you 
no more  14go and  cry unto the gods 
which ye have chosen  let them save 
you in the time of your distress  15and 
the children of israel said unto the 
lord we have sinned  do thou unto 
us whatsoever seemeth good unto 
thee  only deliver us  we pray thee  
this day  16and t hey put away the 
strange gods from among them  and 
served the lord and his soul was 
grieved for the misery of israel   
17then the children of ammon were 
gathered together  and encamped in 
gilead  and the children of israel 
assembled themselves together  and 
encamped in mizpah  18and the 
people  the princes of gilead  said one 
to another  what man is he that will 
begin to fight against the children of 
ammon  he shall be head over all the 
inhabitants of gilead   10 judges  
364 
 now jephthah the gileadite 
was a mighty m an of valour  
and he was the son of a harlot  and 
gilead begot jephthah  2and gilead s 
wife bore him sons  and when his 
wifes sons grew up  they drove out 
jephthah  and said unto him  thou 
shalt not inherit in our father s house  
for thou art the son of another 
woman  3then jephthah fled from his 
brethren  and dwelt in the land of tob  
and there were gathered vain fellows 
to jephthah  and they went out with 
him  
4and it came to pass after a while  
that the children of ammon made war 
against israel  5and it was so  that 
when the children of ammon made 
war against israel  the elders of gilead 
went to fetch jephthah out of the land 
of tob  6and they said unto jephthah  
come and be our chief  that we may 
fight with the children of ammon  
7and jephthah said  unto the elders of 
gilead  did not ye hate me  and drive 
me out of my father s house  and why 
are ye come unto me now when ye are 
in distress  8and the elders of gilead 
said unto jephthah  therefore are we 
returned to thee now  that thou mayest 
go with  us and fight with the children 
of ammon  and thou shalt be our head 
over all the inhabitants of gilead  
9and jephthah said unto the elders of 
gilead  if ye bring me back home to 
fight with the children of ammon  and 
the lord deliver them before me  i will 
be your head  10and the elders of 
gilead said unto jephthah  the lord shall be witness between us  surely 
according to thy word so will we do  
11then jephthah went with the elders 
of gilead  and the people made him 
head and chief over them  and 
jephthah spoke all his words before 
the lord in mizpah   
12and jephthah sent messengers 
unto the king of the children of 
ammon  saying  what hast thou to do 
with me  that thou art come unto me to 
fight against my land  13and the king 
of the children of ammon  answered 
unto the messengers of jephthah  
because israel took away my land  
when he came up out of egypt  from 
the arnon even unto the jabbok  and 
unto the jordan  now therefore restore 
those cities peaceably  14and 
jephthah sent messengers again unto 
the king of the children of ammon  
15and he said unto him  thus saith 
jephthah  israel took not away the land 
of moab  nor the land of the children 
of ammon  16but when they came up 
from egypt  and israel walked through 
the wilderness unto the red sea  and 
came to kadesh  17then israel sent 
messengers unto the king of edom  
saying  let me  i pray thee  pass 
through thy land  but the king of edom 
hearkened not  and in like manner he 
sent unto the king of moab  but he 
would not  and israel abode in kadesh  
18then he walked through the 
wilderness  and compassed the land of 
edom  and the land of moab  and 
came by the east side of the land of 
moab  and they pitched on the other 11 judges  
365 
 side of the arnon  but they came not 
within the border of moab  for the 
arnon was the border of moab  19and 
israel sent messengers unto sihon king 
of the amorites  the king of heshbon  
and israel said unto him  let us pass  
we pray thee  through thy land unto 
my place  20but sihon trusted not 
israel to pass through his border  but 
sihon gat hered all his people together  
and pitched in jahaz  and fought 
against israel  21and the lord the god 
of israel  delivered sihon and all his 
people into the hand of israel  and they 
smote them  so israel possessed all the 
land of the amorites  the inhabi tants of 
that country  22and they possessed all 
the border of the amorites  from the 
arnon even unto the jabbok  and from 
the wilderness even unto the jordan  
23so now the lord the god of israel  
hath dispossessed the amorites from 
before his people israe l and shouldest 
thou possess them  24wilt not thou 
possess that which chemosh thy god 
giveth thee to possess  so 
whomsoever the lord our god hath 
dispossessed from before us  them will 
we possess  25and now art thou any 
thing better than balak the son of 
zippor  king of moab  did he ever 
strive against israel  or did he ever 
fight against them  26while israel 
dwelt in heshbon and its towns  and in 
aroer and its towns  and in all the 
cities that are along by the side of the 
arnon  three hundred years  where fore 
did ye not recover them within that 
time 27i therefore have not sinned against thee  but thou doest me wrong 
to war against me  the lord the judge  
be judge this day between the children 
of israel and the children of ammon  
28howbeit the king of th e children of 
ammon hearkened not unto the words 
of jephthah which he sent him   
29then the spirit of the lord came 
upon jephthah  and he passed over 
gilead and manasseh  and passed over 
mizpeh of gilead  and from mizpeh of 
gilead he passed over unto the 
children of ammon  30and jephthah 
vowed a vow unto the lord and said  
if thou wilt indeed deliver the 
children of ammon into my hand  
31then it shall be  that whatsoever 
cometh forth of the doors of my house 
to meet me  when i return in peace 
from the chi ldren of ammon  it shall 
be the l ords and i will offer it up for 
a burnt offering  32so jephthah passed 
over unto the children of ammon to 
fight against them  and the lord 
delivered them into his hand  33and he 
smote them from aroer until thou 
come to m innith  even twenty cities  
and unto abel cheramim  with a very 
great slaughter  so the children of 
ammon were subdued before the 
children of israel   
34and jephthah came to mizpah 
unto his house  and behold  his 
daughter came out to meet him with 
timbrel s and with dances  and she was 
his only child  beside her he had 
neither son nor daughter  35and it 
came to pass  when he saw her  that he 
rent his clothes  and said  alas my judges  
366 
 daughter  thou hast brought me very 
low and thou art become my troubler  
for i have opened my mouth unto the 
lord and i cannot go back  36and she 
said unto him  my father  thou hast 
opened thy mouth unto the lord do 
unto me according to that which hath 
proceeded out of thy mouth  
forasmuch as the lord hath taken 
vengeance for th ee of thine enemies  
even of the children of ammon  
37and she said unto her father  let 
this thing be done for me  let me alone 
two months  that i may depart and go 
down upon the mountains  and bewail 
my virginity  i and my companions  
38and he said  go and he sent her 
away for two months  and she 
departed  she and her companions  and 
bewailed her virginity upon the 
mountains  39and it came to pass at the 
end of two months  that she returned 
unto her father  who did with her 
according to his vow which  he had 
vowed  and she had not known man  
and it was a custom in israel  40that 
the daughters of israel went yearly  to 
lament the daughter of jephthah the 
gileadite four days in a year   
and the men of ephraim were 
gathered together  and passed 
to zapho n and they said unto 
jephthah  wherefore didst thou pass 
over to fight against the children of 
ammon  and didst not call us to go 
with thee  we will burn thy house 
upon thee with fire  2and jephthah 
said unto them  i and my people were 
at great strife with the children of ammon  and when i called you  ye 
saved me not out of their hand  3and 
when i saw that ye saved me not  i put 
my life in my hand  and passed over 
against the children of ammon  and 
the lord delivered them into my hand  
wherefore then ar e ye come up unto 
me this day  to fight against me  
4then jephthah gathered together all 
the men of gilead  and fought with 
ephraim  and the men of gilead smote 
ephraim  because they said  ye are 
fugitives of ephraim  ye gileadites  in 
the midst of ephra im and in the midst 
of manasseh  5and the gileadites 
took the fords of the jordan against the 
ephraimites  and it was so  that when 
any of the fugitives of ephraim said  
let me go over  the men of gilead 
said unto him  art thou an 
ephraimite  if he s aid nay 6then 
said they unto him  say now 
shibboleth  and he said sibboleth  
for he could not frame to pronounce it 
right  then they laid hold on him  and 
slew him at the fords of the jordan  
and there fell at that time of ephraim 
forty and two tho usand   
7and jephthah judged israel six 
years  then died jephthah the 
gileadite  and was buried in one of the 
cities of gilead   
8and after him ibzan of beth lehem 
judged israel  9and he had thirty sons  
and thirty daughters he sent abroad  
and thirty daug hters he brought in 
from abroad for his sons  and he 
judged israel seven years  10and ibzan 
died and was buried at beth lehem   12 judges  
367 
 11and after him elon the zebulunite 
judged israel  and he judged israel ten 
years  12and elon the zebulunite died  
and was buri ed in aijalon in the land 
of zebulun   
13and after him abdon the son of 
hillel the pirathonite judged israel  
14and he had forty sons and thirty 
sonssons that rode on threescore and 
ten ass colts  and he judged israel eight 
years  15and abdon the son of hillel 
the pirathonite died  and was buried in 
pirathon in the land of ephraim  in the 
hillcountry of the amalekites   
and the children of israel 
again did that which was evil 
in the sight of the lord and the lord 
delivered them into the hand of the 
philistines forty years   
2and there was a certain man of 
zorah  of the family of the danites  
whose name was manoah  and his 
wife was barren  and bore not  3and 
the angel of the lord appeared unto 
the woman  and said unto her  behold 
now thou art barren  and hast not 
borne  but thou shalt conceive  and 
bear a son  4now therefore beware  i 
pray thee  and drink no wine nor 
strong drink  and eat not any unclean 
thing  5for lo thou shalt conceive  and 
bear a son  and no razor shall come 
upon his head  for the child shall be a 
nazirite unto god from the womb  and 
he shall begin to save israel out of the 
hand of the philistines  6then the 
woman came and told her husband  
saying  a man of god came unto me  
and his countenance was like the countenance of the a ngel of god  very 
terrible  and i asked him not whence 
he was  neither told he me his name  
7but he said unto me  behold  thou 
shalt conceive  and bear a son  and 
now drink no wine nor strong drink  
and eat not any unclean thing  for the 
child shall be a n azirite unto god from 
the womb to the day of his death   
8then manoah entreated the lord 
and said  oh lord i pray thee  let 
the man of god whom thou didst send 
come again unto us  and teach us what 
we shall do unto the child that shall be 
born 9and god hearkened to the 
voice of manoah  and the angel of god 
came again unto the woman as she sat 
in the field  but manoah her husband 
was not with her  10and the woman 
made haste  and ran  and told her 
husband  and said unto him  behold  
the man hath appea red unto me  that 
came unto me that day  11and 
manoah arose  and went after his wife  
and came to the man  and said unto 
him art thou the man that spokest 
unto the woman  and he said  i am 
12and manoah said  now when thy 
word cometh to pass  what s hall be the 
rule for the child  and what shall be 
done with him  13and the angel of the 
lord said unto manoah  of all that i 
said unto the woman let her beware  
14she may not eat of any thing that 
cometh of the grapevine  neither let 
her drink wine or st rong drink  nor eat 
any unclean thing  all that i 
commanded her let her observe  
15and manoah said unto the angel of 13 judges  
368 
 the lord i pray thee  let us detain 
thee that we may make ready a kid for 
thee 16and the angel of the lord said 
unto manoah  though thou detain 
me i will not eat of thy bread  and if 
thou wilt make ready a burnt offering  
thou must offer it unto the lord for 
manoah knew not that he was the 
angel of the lord 17and manoah said 
unto the angel of the lord what is 
thy name  that when thy words come 
to pass we may do thee honour  
18and the angel of the lord said unto 
him wherefore askest thou after my 
name  seeing it is hidden  19so 
manoah took the kid with the meal 
offering  and offered it upon the rock 
unto the lord and the ange l did 
wondrously  and manoah and his wife 
looked on  20for it came to pass  when 
the flame went up toward heaven from 
off the altar  that the angel of the lord 
ascended in the flame of the altar  and 
manoah and his wife looked on  and 
they fell on their f aces to the ground  
21but the angel of the lord did no 
more appear to manoah or to his wife  
then manoah knew that he was the 
angel of the lord 22and manoah said 
unto his wife  we shall surely die  
because we have seen god  23but his 
wife said unto him  if the lord were 
pleased to kill us  he would not have 
received a burnt offering and a meal 
offering at our hand  neither would he 
have shown us all these things  nor 
would at this time have told such 
things as these   24and the woman bore a son  and 
called his name samson  and the child 
grew  and the lord blessed him  25and 
the spirit of the lord began to move 
him in mahaneh dan between zorah 
and eshtaol   
and samson went down to 
timnah  and saw a woman in 
timnah of the daughters of the 
philistines  2and he came up  and told 
his father and his mother  and said  i 
have seen a woman in timnah of the 
daughters of the philistines  now 
therefore get her for me to wife  
3then his father and his mother said 
unto him  is there never a woman 
among the daug hters of thy brethren  
or among all my people  that thou 
goest to take a wife of the 
uncircumcised philistines  and 
samson said unto his father  get her 
for me  for she pleaseth me well  4but 
his father and his mother knew not that 
it was of the lord for he sought an 
occasion against the philistines  now 
at that time the philistines had rule 
over israel   
5then went samson down  and his 
father and his mother  to timnah  and 
came to the vineyards of timnah  and 
behold  a young lion roared against 
him 6and the spirit of the lord came 
mightily upon him  and he rent him as 
one would have rent a kid  and he had 
nothing in his hand  but he told not his 
father or his mother what he had done  
7and he went down  and talked with 
the woman  and she pleased samson  
well 8and after a while he returned to 14 judges  
369 
 take her  and he turned aside to see the 
carcass of the lion  and behold  there 
was a swarm of bees in the body of the 
lion and honey  9and he scraped it out 
into his hands  and went on  eating as 
he went  and he came to his father and 
mother  and gave unto them  and they 
did eat  but he told them not that he 
had scraped the honey out of the body 
of the lion  10and his father went down 
unto the woman  and samson made 
there a feast  for so used the young 
men to do  11and it came to pass  when 
they saw him  that they brought thirty 
companions to be with him  12and 
samson said unto them  let me now 
put forth a riddle unto you  if ye can 
declare it me within the seven days of 
the feast  and find it out  then i will 
give you thirty linen garments and 
thirty changes of raiment  13but if ye 
cannot declare it me  then shall ye give 
me thirty linen garments and thirty 
changes of raiment  and they said 
unto him  put forth thy riddle  that we 
may hear it  14and he said unto  them   
out of the eater came forth food   
and out of the strong came forth 
sweetness   
and they could not in three days 
declare the riddle  15and it came to 
pass on the seventh day  that they said 
unto samson s wife  entice thy 
husband  that he may decla re unto us 
the riddle  lest we burn thee and thy 
father s house with fire  have ye called 
us hither to impoverish us  16and 
samson s wife wept before him  and 
said thou dost but hate me  and lovest me not  thou hast put forth a 
riddle unto the children of my people  
and wilt thou not tell it me  and he 
said unto her  behold  i have not told 
it my father nor my mother  and shall i 
tell thee  17and she wept before him 
the seven days  while their feast lasted  
and it came to pass on the seventh day  
that he told her  because she pressed 
him sore  and she told the riddle to the 
children of her people  18and the men 
of the city said unto him on the 
seventh day before the sun went down   
what is sweeter than honey   
and what is stronger than a lion   
and he said unto them   
if ye had not plowed with my heifer   
ye had not found out my riddle   
19and the spirit of the lord came 
mightily upon him  and he went down 
to ashkelon  and smote thirty men of 
them  and took their spoil  and gave 
the changes of raiment u nto them that 
declared the riddle  and his anger was 
kindled  and he went up to his father s 
house  20but samson s wife was given 
to his companion  whom he had had 
for his friend   
but it came to pass after a 
while  in the time of wheat 
harvest  that sa mson visited his wife 
with a kid  and he said  i will go in to 
my wife into the chamber  but her 
father would not suffer him to go in  
2and her father said  i verily thought 
that thou hadst utterly hated her  
therefore i gave her to thy companion  
is no t her younger sister fairer than 
she take her  i pray thee  instead of 15 judges  
370 
 her 3and samson said unto them  
this time shall i be quits with the 
philistines  when i do them a 
mischief  4and samson went and 
caught three hundred foxes  and took 
torches  and t urned tail to tail  and put 
a torch in the midst between every two 
tails 5and when he had set the torches 
on fire  he let them go into the 
standing corn of the philistines  and 
burnt up both the shocks and the 
standing corn  and also the oliveyards  
6then  the philistines said  who hath 
done this  and they said  samson  
the son inlaw of the timnite  because 
he hath taken his wife  and given her 
to his companion  and the philistines 
came up  and burnt her and her father 
with fire  7and samson said unto 
them  if ye do after this manner  
surely i will be avenged of you  and 
after that i will cease  8and he smote 
them hip and thigh with a great 
slaughter  and he went down and dwelt 
in the cleft of the rock of etam   
9then the philistines went up  and 
pitched in judah  and spread 
themselves against lehi  10and the 
men of judah said  why are ye come 
up against us  and they said  to 
bind samson are we come up  to do to 
him as he hath done to us  11then 
three thousand men of judah went 
down to the cleft of  the rock of etam  
and said to samson  knowest thou 
not that the philistines are rulers over 
us what then is this that thou hast 
done unto us  and he said unto them  
as they did unto me  so have i done unto them  12and they said unto him  
we are come  down to bind thee  that 
we may deliver thee into the hand of 
the philistines  and samson said unto 
them  swear unto me  that ye will not 
fall upon me yourselves  13and they 
spoke unto him  saying  no but we 
will bind thee fast  and deliver thee 
into their hand  but surely we will not 
kill thee  and they bound him with 
two new ropes  and brought him up 
from the rock  14when he came unto 
lehi the philistines shouted as they 
met him  and the spirit of the lord 
came mightily upon him  and the ropes 
that were upon his arms became as 
flax that was burnt with fire  and his 
bands dropped from off his hands  
15and he found a new jawbone of an 
ass and put forth his hand  and took it  
and smote a thousand men therewith  
16and samson said   
with the jawbone of an ass  heaps 
upon heaps   
with the jawbone of an ass have i 
smitten a thousand men   
17and it came to pass  when he had 
made an end of speaking  that he cast 
away the jawbone out of his hand  and 
that place was called aramath lehi 
18and he was sore athir st and called 
on the lord and said  thou hast 
given this great deliverance by the 
hand of thy servant  and now shall i 
die for thirst  and fall into the hand of 
the uncircumcised  19but god cleaved 
the hollow place that is in lehi  and 
                                                      
a that is the hill of the jawbone  judges  
371 
 there came water  thereout  and when 
he had drunk  his spirit came back  and 
he revived  wherefore the name 
thereof was called aenhakkore  which 
is in lehi unto this day  20and he 
judged israel in the days of the 
philistines twenty years   
and samson went to gaza  
and saw there a harlot  and 
went in unto her  2and it was told  the 
gazites  saying  samson is come 
hither  and they compassed him in  
and lay in wait for him all night in the 
gate of the city  and were quiet all the 
night  saying  let be till morning 
light then we will kill him  3and 
samson lay till midnight  and arose at 
midnight  and laid hold of the doors of 
the gate of the city  and the two posts  
and plucked them up  bar and all  and 
put them upon his shoulders  and 
carried them up to the top of the  
mountain that is before hebron   
4and it came to pass afterward  that 
he loved a woman in the valley of 
sorek  whose name was delilah  5and 
the lords of the philistines came up 
unto her  and said unto her  entice 
him and see wherein his great strength 
lieth and by what means we may 
prevail against him  that we may bind 
him to afflict him  and we will give 
thee every one of us eleven hundred 
pieces of silver  6and delilah said to 
samson  tell me  i pray thee  wherein 
thy great strength lieth  and where with 
                                                      
a that is the spring of him tha t 
called  thou mightest be bound to afflict thee  
7and samson said unto her  if they 
bind me with seven fresh bowstrings 
that were never dried  then shall i 
become weak  and be as any other 
man 8then the lords of the philistines 
brought up to her seven fres h 
bowstrings which had not been dried  
and she bound him with them  9now 
she had liers inwait abiding in the 
inner chamber  and she said unto him  
the philistines are upon thee  
samson  and he broke the bowstrings 
as a string of tow is broken when it 
toucheth the fire  so his strength was 
not known  10and delilah said unto 
samson  behold  thou hast mocked 
me and told me lies  now tell me  i 
pray thee  wherewith thou mightest be 
bound  11and he said unto her  if 
they only bind me with new ropes 
wherew ith no work  hath been done  
then shall i become weak  and be as 
any other man  12so delilah took new 
ropes  and bound him therewith  and 
said unto him  the philistines are 
upon thee  samson  and the liers in
wait were abiding in the inner 
chamber  and he broke them from off 
his arms like a thread  13and delilah 
said unto samson  hitherto thou hast 
mocked me  and told me lies  tell me 
wherewith thou mightest be bound  
and he said unto her  if thou weavest 
the seven locks of my head with the 
web 14and she fastened it with the 
pin and said unto him  the 
philistines are upon thee  samson  
and he awoke out of his sleep  and 16 judges  
372 
 plucked away the pin of the beam  and 
the web  15and she said unto him  
how canst thou say  i love thee  when 
thy heart is not w ith me  thou hast 
mocked me these three times  and hast 
not told me wherein thy great strength 
lieth 16and it came to pass  when she 
pressed him daily with her words  and 
urged him  that his soul was vexed 
unto death  17and he told her all his 
heart  and said unto her  there hath 
not come a razor upon my head  for i 
have been a nazirite unto god from 
my mother s womb  if i be shaven  
then my strength will go from me  and 
i shall become weak  and be like any 
other man  18and when delilah saw 
that he had told her all his heart  she 
sent and called for the lords of the 
philistines  saying  come up this 
once  for he hath told me all his heart  
then the lords of the philistines came 
up unto her  and brought the money in 
their hand  19and she made him sleep 
upon her knees  and she called for a 
man and had the seven locks of his 
head shaven off  and she began to 
afflict him  and his strength went from 
him 20and she said  the philistines 
are upon thee  samson  and he awoke 
out of his sleep  and said  i will go out 
as at other times  and shake myself  
but he knew not that the lord was 
departed from him  21and the 
philistines laid hold on him  and put 
out his eyes  and they brought him 
down to gaza  and bound him with 
fetters of brass  and he did grind in th e 
prison house  22howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was 
shaven   
23and the lords of the philistines 
gathered them together to offer a great 
sacrifice unto dagon their god  and to 
rejoice  for they said  our god hath 
delivered samso n our enemy into our 
hand  24and when the people saw 
him they praised their god  for they 
said our god hath delivered into our 
hand our enemy  and the destroyer of 
our country  who hath slain many of 
us 25and it came to pass  when their 
hearts were m erry that they said  call 
for samson  that he may make us 
sport  and they called for samson out 
of the prison house  and he made sport 
before them  and they set him between 
the pillars  26and samson said unto the 
lad that held him by the hand  suffer 
me that i may feel the pillars 
whereupon the house resteth  that i 
may lean upon them  27now the house 
was full of men and women  and all 
the lords of the philistines were there  
and there were upon the roof about 
three thousand men and women  that 
beheld while samson made sport  
28and samson called unto the lord 
and said  o lord g od remember me  
i pray thee  and strengthen me  i pray 
thee  only this once  o god  that i 
may be this once avenged of the 
philistines for my two eyes  29and 
samson took fast hold of the two 
middle pillars upon which the house 
rested  and leaned upon them  the one 
with his right hand  and the other with 
his left  30and samson said  let me judges  
373 
 die with the philistines  and he bent 
with all his might  and the house fell 
upon the lo rds and upon all the people 
that were therein  so the dead that he 
slew at his death were more than they 
that he slew in his life  31then his 
brethren and all the house of his father 
came down  and took him  and brought 
him up  and buried him between zora h 
and eshtaol in the burying place of 
manoah his father  and he judged 
israel twenty years   
now there was a man of the 
hillcountry of ephraim  
whose name was micah  2and he said 
unto his mother  the eleven hundred 
pieces of silver that were taken fro m 
thee about which thou didst utter a 
curse  and didst also speak it in mine 
ears behold  the silver is with me  i 
took it  and his mother said  blessed 
be my son of the lord 3and he 
restored the eleven hundred pieces of 
silver to his mother  and his  mother 
said i verily dedicate the silver unto 
the lord from my hand for my son  to 
make a graven image and a molten 
image  now therefore i will restore it 
unto thee  4and when he restored the 
money unto his mother  his mother 
took two hundred pieces of  silver  and 
gave them to the founder  who made 
thereof a graven image and a molten 
image  and it was in the house of 
micah  5and the man micah had a 
house of god  and he made an ephod  
and teraphim  and consecrated one of 
his sons  who became his priest  6in 
those days there was no king in israel  every man did that which was right in 
his own eyes  7and there was a young 
man out of beth lehem in judah in 
the family of judah who was a 
levite  and he sojourned there  8and 
the man departed out of the city  out of 
beth lehem in judah  to sojourn where 
he could find a place  and he came to 
the hill country of ephraim to the 
house of micah  as he journeyed  9and 
micah said unto him  whence comest 
thou and he said unto him  i am a 
levite of beth lehem in judah  and i 
go to sojourn where i may find a 
place  10and micah said unto him  
dwell with me  and be unto me a 
father and a priest  and i will give thee 
ten pieces of silver by the year  and a 
suit of apparel  and thy victuals  so 
the levite went in  11and the levite 
was content to dwell with the man  and 
the young man was unto him as one of 
his sons  12and micah consecrated the 
levite  and the young man became his 
priest  and was in the house of micah  
13then said micah  now know i that 
the lord will do me  good  seeing i 
have a levite as my priest   
in those days there was no 
king in israel  and in those 
days the tribe of the danites sought 
them an inheritance to dwell in  for 
unto that day there had nothing been 
allotted unto them among the tribes of 
israel for an inheritance  2and the 
children of dan sent of their family 
five men from their whole number  
men of valour  from zorah  and from 
eshtaol  to spy out the land  and to 17 
18 judges  
374 
 search it  and they said unto them  
go search the land  and they came 
to the hill country of ephraim  unto 
the house of micah  and lodged there  
3when they were by the house of 
micah  they knew the voice of the 
young man the levite  and they turned 
aside thither  and said unto him  who 
brought thee hither  and what doest 
thou i n this place  and what hast thou 
here 4and he said unto them  thus 
and thus hath micah dealt with me  
and he hath hired me  and i am 
become his priest  5and they said 
unto him  ask counsel  we pray thee  
of god  that we may know whether 
our way which we are going shall be 
prosperous  6and the priest said unto 
them  go in peace  before the lord is 
your way wherein ye go   
7then the five men departed  and 
came to laish  and saw the people that 
were therein  how they dwelt in 
security  after the manner  of the 
zidonians  quiet and secure  for there 
was none in the land  possessing 
authority  that might put them to 
shame in any thing  and they were far 
from the zidonians  and had no 
dealings with any man  8and they 
came unto their brethren to zorah and 
eshtaol  and their brethren said unto 
them  what say ye  9and they said  
arise  and let us go up against them  
for we have seen the land  and behold  
it is very good  and are ye still  be not 
slothful to go and to enter in to possess 
the land  10when ye go ye shall come 
unto a people secure  and the land is large  for god hath given it into your 
hand  a place where there is no want  it 
hath every thing that is in the earth   
11and there set forth from thence of 
the family of the danites  out of zorah 
and out of eshtaol  six hundred men 
girt with weapons of war  12and they 
went up  and encamped in kiriath 
jearim  in judah  wherefore that place 
was called mahaneh dan unto this day  
behold  it is behind kiriath jearim  
13and they passed thence unto the hill 
country of ephraim  and came unto the 
house of micah  14then answered the 
five men that went to spy out the 
country of laish  and said unto their 
brethren  do ye know that there is in 
these houses an ephod  and teraphim  
and a graven image  and a molten 
image  now therefore consider what 
ye have to do  15and they turned aside 
thither  and came to the house of the 
young man the levite  even unto the 
house of micah  and asked him of his 
welfare  16and the six hundred men 
girt with their weapons of war  who 
were of the children of dan  stood by 
the entrance of the gate  17and the five 
men that went to spy out the land went 
up and came in thither  and took the 
graven image  and the ephod  and the 
teraphim  and the molten image  and 
the priest stood by the en trance of the 
gate with the six hundred men girt 
with weapons of war  18and when 
these went into micah s house  and 
fetched the graven image of the ephod  
and the teraphim  and the molten 
image  the priest said unto them  judges  
375 
 what do ye  19and they said unto  
him hold thy peace  lay thy hand 
upon thy mouth  and go with us  and 
be to us a father and a priest  is it 
better for thee to be priest unto the 
house of one man  or to be priest unto 
a tribe and a family in israel  20and 
the priest s heart was glad  and he took 
the ephod  and the teraphim  and the 
graven image  and went in the midst of 
the people  21so they turned and 
departed  and put the little ones and 
the cattle and the goods before them  
22when they were a good way from 
the house of micah  the men  that were 
in the houses near to micah s house 
were gathered together  and overtook 
the children of dan  23and they cried 
unto the children of dan  and they 
turned their faces  and said unto 
micah  what aileth thee  that thou 
comest with such a company  24and 
he said  ye have taken away my god 
which i made  and the priest  and are 
gone away  and what have i more  and 
how then say ye unto me  what aileth 
thee 25and the children of dan said 
unto him  let not thy voice be heard 
among us  lest angry fello ws fall upon 
you and thou lose thy life  with the 
lives of thy household  26and the 
children of dan went their way  and 
when micah saw that they were too 
strong for him  he turned and went 
back unto his house  27and they took 
that which micah had made  and the 
priest whom he had  and came unto 
laish  unto a people quiet and secure  
and smote them with the edge of the sword  and they burnt the city with 
fire 28and there was no deliverer  
because it was far from zidon  and 
they had no dealings with any man  
and it was in the valley that lieth by 
beth rehob  and they built the city  
and dwelt therein  29and they called 
the name of the city dan  after the 
name of dan their father  who was 
born unto israel  howbeit the name of 
the city was laish at the first  30and 
the children of dan set up for 
themselves the graven image  and 
jonathan  the son of gershom  the son 
of amanasseh  he and his sons were 
priests to the tribe of the danites until 
the day of the captivity of the land  
31so they set them up micah s gra ven 
image which he made  all the time that 
the house of god was in shiloh   
and it came to pass in those 
days when there was no king 
in israel  that there was a certain 
levite sojourning on the farther side of 
the hill country of ephraim  who took 
to him a concubine out of beth lehem 
in judah  2and his concubine played 
the harlot against him  and went away 
from him unto her father s house to 
beth lehem in judah  and was there 
the space of four months  3and her 
husband arose  and went after her  to 
speak  kindly unto her  to bring her 
back  having his servant with him  and 
                                                      
a heb   with  suspended 
indicating an earlier reading moses  
 19 judges  
376 
 a couple of asses  and she brought him 
into her father s house  and when the 
father of the damsel saw him  he 
rejoiced to meet him  4and his father 
inlaw the damsel s father  retained 
him and he abode with him three 
days so they did eat and drink  and 
lodged there  5and it came to pass on 
the fourth day  that they arose early in 
the morning  and he rose up to depart  
and the damsel s father said unto his 
soninlaw stay thy heart wi th a 
morsel of bread  and afterward ye shall 
go your way  6so they sat down  and 
did eat and drink  both of them 
together  and the damsel s father said 
unto the man  be content  i pray thee  
and tarry all night  and let thy heart be 
merry  7and the man rose up to 
depart  but his father inlaw urged 
him and he lodged there again  8and 
he arose early in the morning on the 
fifth day to depart  and the damsel s 
father said  stay thy heart  i pray thee  
and tarry ye until the day declineth  
and they did ea t both of them  9and 
when the man rose up to depart  he 
and his concubine  and his servant  his 
father inlaw the damsel s father  said 
unto him  behold  now the day 
draweth toward evening  tarry  i pray 
you all night  behold  the day groweth 
to an en d lodge here  that thy heart 
may be merry  and to morrow get you 
early on your way  that thou mayest go 
home  10but the man would not tarry 
that night  but he rose up and departed  
and came over against jebus the 
same is jerusalem  and there were with him a couple of asses saddled  his 
concubine also was with him  11when 
they were by jebus the day was far 
spent the servant said unto his 
master  come  i pray thee  and let us 
turn aside into this city of the 
jebusites  and lodge in it  12and his 
master sa id unto him  we will not 
turn aside into the city of a foreigner  
that is not of the children of israel  but 
we will pass over to gibeah  13and he 
said unto his servant  come and let us 
draw near to one of these places  and 
we will lodge in gibeah  or in ramah  
14so they passed on and went their 
way and the sun went down upon 
them near to gibeah  which belongeth 
to benjamin  15and they turned aside 
thither  to go in to lodge in gibeah  
and he went in  and sat him down in 
the broad place of the city  for there 
was no man that took them into his 
house to lodge  16and behold  there 
came an old man from his work out of 
the field at even  now the man was of 
the hill country of ephraim  and he 
sojourned in gibeah  but the men of 
the place were benjamites  17and he 
lifted up his eyes  and saw the 
wayfaring man in the broad place of 
the city  and the old man said  
whither goest thou  and whence 
comest thou  18and he said unto him  
we are passing from beth lehem in 
judah unto the farther side of the hill 
coun try of ephraim  from thence am i  
and i went to beth lehem in judah  
and i am now going to the house of the 
lord and there is no man that taketh judges  
377 
 me into his house  19yet there is both 
straw and provender for our asses  and 
there is bread and wine also for  me 
and for thy handmaid  and for the 
young man that is with thy servants  
there is no want of any thing  20and 
the old man said  peace be unto thee  
howsoever let all thy wants lie upon 
me only lodge not in the broad place  
21so he brought him into h is house  
and gave the asses fodder  and they 
washed their feet  and did eat and 
drink  22as they were making their 
hearts merry  behold  the men of the 
city certain base fellows  beset the 
house round about  beating at the door  
and they spoke to the mas ter of the 
house  the old man  saying  bring 
forth the man that came into thy house  
that we may know him  23and the 
man the master of the house  went out 
unto them  and said unto them  nay 
my brethren  i pray you  do not so 
wickedly  seeing that this  man is come 
into my house  do not this wanton 
deed  24behold  here is my daughter a 
virgin  and his concubine  i will bring 
them out now  and humble ye them  
and do with them what seemeth good 
unto you  but unto this man do not so 
wanton a thing  25but t he men would 
not hearken to him  so the man laid 
hold on his concubine  and brought her 
forth unto them  and they knew her  
and abused her all the night until the 
morning  and when the day began to 
spring  they let her go  26then came 
the woman in the dawn ing of the day  
and fell down at the door of the man s house where her lord was  till it was 
light 27and her lord rose up in the 
morning  and opened the doors of the 
house  and went out to go his way  
and behold  the woman his concubine 
was fallen down a t the door of the 
house  with her hands upon the 
threshold  28and he said unto her  up 
and let us be going  but none 
answered  then he took her up upon 
the ass  and the man rose up  and got 
him unto his place  29and when he was 
come into his house  he took a knife  
and laid hold on his concubine  and 
divided her  limb by limb  into twelve 
pieces  and sent her throughout all the 
borders of israel  30and it was so  that 
all that saw it said  such a thing hath 
not happened nor been seen from the 
day that t he children of israel came up 
out of the land of egypt unto this day  
consider it  take counsel  and speak   
then all the children of israel 
went out  and the congregation 
was assembled as one man  from dan 
even to beer sheba  with the land of 
gilead  unto the lord at mizpah  2and 
the chiefs of all the people  even of all 
the tribes of israel  presented 
themselves in the assembly of the 
people of god  four hundred thousand 
footmen that drew sword  3now the 
children of benjamin heard that the 
children o f israel were gone up to 
mizpah and the children of israel 
said tell us  how was this 
wickedness brought to pass  4and the 
levite  the husband of the woman that 
was murdered  answered and said  i 20 judges  
378 
 came into gibeah that belongeth to 
benjamin  i and my c oncubine  to 
lodge  5and the men of gibeah rose 
against me  and beset the house round 
about upon me by night  me they 
thought to have slain  and my 
concubine they forced  and she is 
dead  6and i took my concubine  and 
cut her in pieces  and sent her 
throug hout all the country of the 
inheritance of israel  for they have 
committed lewdness and wantonness 
in israel 7behold  ye are all here  
children of israel  give here your 
advice and council  8and all the 
people arose as one man  saying  we 
will not any of  us go to his tent  
neither will we any of us turn unto his 
house  9but now this is the thing which 
we will do to gibeah  we will go up 
against it by lot  10and we will take ten 
men of a hundred throughout all the 
tribes of israel  and a hundred of a 
thous and and a thousand out of ten 
thousand  to fetch victuals for the 
people  that they may do  when they 
come to agibeah of benjamin  
according to all the wantonness that 
they have wrought in israel  11so all 
the men of israel were gathered 
against the city  knit together as one 
man  
12and the tribes of israel sent men 
through all the tribe of benjamin  
saying  what wickedness is this that 
is come to pass among you  13now 
therefore deliver up the men  the base 
                                                      
a heb geba  fellows that are in gibeah  that we 
may put th em to death  and put away 
evil from israel  but the children of 
benjamin would not hearken to the 
voice of their brethren the children of 
israel  14and the children of benjamin 
gathered themselves together out of 
their cities unto gibeah  to go out to 
battle against the children of israel  
15and the children of benjamin 
numbered on that day out of the cities 
twenty and six thousand men that drew 
sword  besides the inhabitants of 
gibeah  who numbered seven hundred 
chosen men  16all this people  even 
seven h undred chosen men  were left 
handed  every one could sling stones 
at a hair breadth  and not miss   
17and the men of israel  beside 
benjamin  numbered four hundred 
thousand men that drew sword  all 
these were men of war  18and the 
children of israel arose  and went up to 
beth el and asked counsel of god  
and they said  who shall go up for us 
first to battle against the children of 
benjamin  and the lord said judah 
first 19and the children of israel rose 
up in the morning  and encamped 
against gibeah  20and the men of 
israel went out to battle against 
benjamin  and the men of israel set the 
battle in array against them at gibeah  
21and the children of benjamin came 
forth out of gibeah  and destroyed 
down to the ground of the israelites on 
that day twen ty and two thousand men  
22and the people  the men of israel  
encouraged themselves  and set the judges  
379 
 battle again in array in the place where 
they set themselves in array the first 
day 23and the children of israel went 
up and wept before the lord until 
even  and they asked of the lord 
saying  shall i again draw nigh to 
battle against the children of benjamin 
my brother  and the lord said go 
up against him   
24and the children of israel came 
near against the children of benjamin 
the second day  25and benj amin went 
forth against them out of gibeah the 
second day  and destroyed down to the 
ground of the children of israel again 
eighteen thousand men  all these drew 
the sword  26then all the children of 
israel  and all the people  went up  and 
came unto beth el and wept  and sat 
there before the lord and fasted that 
day until even  and they offered burnt 
offerings and peace offerings before 
the lord 27and the children of israel 
asked of the l ordfor the ark of the 
covenant of god was there in those 
days 28and phinehas  the son of 
eleazar  the son of aaron  stood before 
it in those days saying  shall i yet 
again go out to battle against the 
children of benjamin my brother  or 
shall i cease  and the lord said go 
up for to morrow i will deliver him 
into t hy hand  29and israel set liers 
inwait against gibeah round about   
30and the children of israel went up 
against the children of benjamin on 
the third day  and set themselves in 
array against gibeah  as at other times  
31and the children of benjamin went  out against the people  and were drawn 
away from the city  and they began to 
smite and kill of the people  as at other 
times  in the field  in the highways  of 
which one goeth up to beth el and the 
other to gibeah  about thirty men of 
israel  32and the c hildren of benjamin 
said they are smitten down before 
us as at the first  but the children of 
israel said  let us flee  and draw them 
away from the city unto the highways  
33and all the men of israel rose up out 
of their place  and set themselves in 
array at baal tamar  and the liers in
wait of israel broke forth out of their 
place  even out of maareh geba  34and 
there came over against gibeah ten 
thousand chosen men out of all israel  
and the battle was sore  but they knew 
not that evil was close upo n them  
35and the lord smote benjamin before 
israel  and the children of israel 
destroyed of benjamin that day twenty 
and five thousand and a hundred men  
all these drew the sword   
36so the children of benjamin saw 
that they were smitten  and the men of 
israel gave place to benjamin  because 
they trusted unto the liers inwait 
whom they had set against gibeah  
37and the liers inwait hastened  and 
rushed upon gibeah  and the liers in
wait drew forth  and smote all the city 
with the edge of the sword  38now 
there was an appointed sign between 
the men of israel and the liers inwait 
that they should make a great beacon 
of smoke rise up out of the city  
39and the men of israel turned in the judges  
380 
 battle  and benjamin began to smite 
and kill of the men of israel a bout 
thirty persons  for they said  surely 
they are smitten down before us  as in 
the first battle  40but when the beacon 
began to arise up out of the city in a 
pillar of smoke  the benjamites looked 
behind them  and behold  the whole of 
the city went u p in smoke to heaven  
41and the men of israel turned  and the 
men of benjamin were amazed  for 
they saw that evil was come upon 
them  42therefore they turned their 
backs before the men of israel unto the 
way of the wilderness  but the battle 
followed hard after them  and they that 
came out of the city destroyed them in 
the midst of the men of israel  43they 
inclosed the benjamites round about  
and chased them  and overtook them at 
their resting place  as far as over 
against gibeah toward the sunrising  
44and there fell of benjamin eighteen 
thousand men  all these were men of 
valour  45and they turned and fled 
toward the wilderness unto the rock of 
rimmon  and they gleaned of them in 
the highways five thousand men  and 
followed hard after them unto gidom  
and smote of them two thousand men  
46so that all who fell that day of 
benjamin were twenty and five 
thousand men that drew the sword  all 
these were men of valour  47but six 
hundred men turned and fled toward 
the wilderness unto the rock of 
rimmon  and abode  in the rock of 
rimmon four months  48and the men 
of israel turned back upon the children of benjamin  and smote them with the 
edge of the sword  both the entire city  
and the cattle  and all that they found  
moreover all the cities which they 
found they s et on fire   
now the men of israel had 
sworn in mizpah  saying  
there shall not any of us give his 
daughter unto benjamin to wife  2and 
the people came to beth el and sat 
there till even before god  and lifted 
up their voices  and wept sore  3and 
they said  o lord the god of israel  
why is this come to pass in israel  that 
there should be to day one tribe 
lacking in israel  4and it came to pass 
on the morrow that the people rose 
early  and built there an altar  and 
offered burnt offerings and peace 
offerings  5and the children of israel 
said who is there among all the 
tribes of israel that came not up in the 
assembly unto the lord for they had 
made a great oath concerning him that 
came not up unto the lord to mizpah  
saying  he shall surely be put to 
death  6and the children of israel 
repented them for benjamin their 
brother  and said  there is one tribe 
cut off from israel this day  7how shall 
we do for wives for them that remain  
seeing we have sworn by the lord that 
we will not give them of  our daughters 
to wives  8and they said  what one 
is there of the tribes of israel that came 
not up unto the lord to mizpah  and 
behold  there came none to the camp 
from jabesh gilead to the assembly  
9for when the people were numbered  21 judges  
381 
 behold  there w ere none of the 
inhabitants of jabesh gilead there  
10and the congregation sent thither 
twelve thousand men of the valiantest  
and commanded them  saying  go 
and smite the inhabitants of jabesh 
gilead with the edge of the sword  with 
the women and the lit tle ones  11and 
this is the thing that ye shall do  ye 
shall utterly destroy every male  and 
every woman that hath lain by man  
12and they found among the 
inhabitants of jabesh gilead four 
hundred young virgins  that had not 
known man by lying with him  and 
they brought them unto the camp to 
shiloh  which is in the land of canaan   
13and the whole congregation sent 
and spoke to the children of benjamin 
that were in the rock of rimmon  and 
proclaimed peace unto them  14and 
benjamin returned at that time  and 
they gave them the women whom they 
had saved alive of the women of 
jabesh gilead  and yet so they sufficed 
them not  15and the people repented 
them for benjamin  because that the 
lord had made a breach in the tribes 
of israel   
16then the elders of the 
congregation said  how shall we do 
for wives for them that remain  seeing 
the women are destroyed out of 
benjamin  17and they said  they 
that are escaped must be as an 
inheritance for benjamin  that a tribe 
be not blotted out from israel  
18howbeit we ma y not give them wives of our daughters  for the 
children of israel had sworn  saying  
cursed be he that giveth a wife to 
benjamin  19and they said  behold  
there is the feast of the lord from year 
to year in shiloh  which is on the north 
of beth el on the east side of the 
highway that goeth up from beth el to 
shechem  and on the south of 
lebonah  20and they commanded the 
children of benjamin  saying  go and 
lie in wait in the vineyards  21and see  
and behold  if the daughters of shiloh 
come out to d ance in the dances  then 
come ye out of the vineyards  and 
catch you every man his wife of the 
daughters of shiloh  and go to the land 
of benjamin  22and it shall be  when 
their fathers or their brethren come to 
strive with us  that we will say unto 
them  grant them graciously unto us  
because we took not for each man of 
them his wife in battle  neither did ye 
give them unto them  that ye should 
now be guilty  23and the children of 
benjamin did so  and took them wives  
according to their number  of them th at 
danced  whom they carried off  and 
they went and returned unto their 
inheritance  and built the cities  and 
dwelt in them  24and the children of 
israel departed thence at that time  
every man to his tribe and to his 
family  and they went out from thence  
every man to his inheritance  25in those 
days there was no king in israel  every 
man did that which was right in his 
own eyes    
382 
    
first samuel  
 
now there  was a certain man of 
ramathaim zophim  of the hill 
country of ephraim  and his name was 
elkanah  the son of jeroham  the son 
of elihu  the son of tohu  the son of 
zuph  an ephraimite  2and he had two 
wives  the name of th e one was 
hannah  and the name of the other 
peninnah  and peninnah had children  
but hannah had no children  3and this 
man went up out of his city from year 
to year to worship and to sacrifice unto 
the lord of hosts in shiloh  and the 
two sons of eli  hoph ni and phinehas  
were there priests unto the lord 4and 
it came to pass upon a day  when 
elkanah sacrificed  that he gave to 
peninnah his wife  and to all her sons 
and her daughters  portions  5but unto 
hannah he gave a double portion  for 
he loved hannah  but the lord had 
shut up her womb  6and her rival 
vexed her sore  to make her fret  
because the lord had shut up her 
womb  7and as he did so year by year  
when she went up to the house of the 
lord so she vexed her  therefore she 
wept  and would not eat  8and elkanah 
her husband said unto her  hannah  
why weepest thou  and why eatest 
thou not  and why is thy heart 
grieved  am not i better to thee than 
ten sons  9so hannah rose up after 
they had eaten in shiloh  and after they had drunk now eli the priest  sat 
upon his seat by the door post of the 
temple of the lord 10and she was in 
bitterness of soul and prayed unto 
the lord and wept sore  11and she 
vowed a vow  and said  o lord of 
hosts  if thou wilt indeed look on the 
affliction of thy handmaid  and 
remember me  and not forget thy 
handmaid  but wilt give unto thy 
handmaid a man child  then i will give 
him unto the lord all the days of his 
life and there shall no razor come 
upon his head  12and it came to pass  
as she prayed long before the lord 
that eli watched her mouth  13now 
hannah  she spoke in her heart  only 
her lips moved  but her voice could not 
be heard  therefore  eli thought she 
had been drunken  14and eli said unto 
her how long wilt thou be drunken  
put away thy wine from thee  15and 
hannah answered and said  no my 
lord i am a woman of a sorrowful 
spirit  i have drunk neither wine nor 
strong drink  but i poured out my soul 
before the lord 16count not thy 
handmaid for a wicked woman  for out 
of the abundance of my complaint and 
my ve xation have i spoken hitherto  
17then eli answered and said  go in 
peace  and the god of israel grant thy 
petition that thou hast asked of him  
18and she said  let thy servant find 1 first samuel  
383 
 favour in thy sight  so the woman 
went her way  and did eat  and her 
countenance was no more sad  19and 
they rose up in the morning early  and 
worshipped before the lord and 
returned  and came to their house to 
ramah  and elkanah knew hannah his 
wife and the lord remembered her  
20and it came to pass  when the time 
was com e about  that hannah 
conceived  and bore a son  and she 
called his name samuel  because i 
have asked him of the lord  
21and the man elkanah  and all his 
house  went up to offer unto the lord 
the yearly sacrifice  and his vow  22but 
hannah went not up  for she said unto 
her husband  until the child be 
weaned  when i will bring him  that he 
may appear before the lord and there 
abide for ever  23and elkanah her 
husband said unto her  do what 
seemeth thee good  tarry until thou 
have weaned him  only the lord 
establish his word  so the woman 
tarried and gave her son suck  until she 
weaned him  24and when she had 
weaned him  she took him up with her  
with three bullocks  and one ephah of 
meal  and a bottle of wine  and brought 
him unto the house of the lord in 
shiloh  and the child was young  
25and when the bullock was slain  the 
child was brought to eli  26and she 
said oh my lord  as thy soul liveth  
my lord  i am the woman that stood by 
thee here  praying unto the lord 27for 
this child i prayed  and t he lord hath 
granted me my petition which i asked of him  28therefore i also have lent 
him to the lord as long as he liveth 
he is lent to the lord and he 
worshipped the lord there   
 
and hannah prayed  and said   
my heart exulteth in the lord  
my hor n is exalted in the lord  
my mouth is enlarged over mine 
enemies   
because i rejoice in thy salvation   
2there is none holy as the lord  
for there is none beside thee   
neither is there any rock like our 
god  
3multiply not exceeding proud talk   
let not  arrogancy come out of your  
 mouth   
for the lord is a god of knowledge   
and by him actions are weighed   
4the bows of the mighty men are 
broken   
and they that stumbled are girded 
with strength   
5they that were full have hired out 
themselves for bread   
and they that were hungry have 
ceased   
while the barren hath borne seven   
she that had many children hath  
 languished   
 
6the lord killeth  and maketh alive   
he bringeth down to the grave  and  
bringeth up   
7the lord maketh poor  and maketh 
rich  
he bringeth low  he also lifteth up   2 first samuel  
384 
 8he raiseth up the poor out of the 
dust  
he lifteth up the needy from the 
dung hill  
to make them sit with princes   
and inherit the throne of glory   
for the pillars of the earth are the 
lords  
and he hath set the world upon 
them   
 
9he will keep the feet of his holy 
ones  
but the wicked shall be put to 
silence in darkness   
for not by strength shall man 
prevail   
10they that strive with the lord 
shall be broken to pieces   
against them will he thunder in 
heaven   
the lord will judge the ends of the 
earth   
and he will give strength unto his 
king  
and exalt the horn of his anointed   
 
11and elkanah went to ramah to his 
house  and the child did minister unto 
the lord before eli the priest   
12now the sons of eli wer e base 
men they knew not the lord 13and 
the custom of the priests with the 
people was  that when any man 
offered sacrifice  the priest s servant 
came  while the flesh was in seething  
with a flesh hook of three teeth in his 
band  14and he struck it into  the pan  or 
kettle  or caldron  or pot  all that the flesh hook brought up the priest took 
therewith  so they did unto all the 
israelites that came thither in shiloh  
15yea before the fat was made to 
smoke  the priest s servant came  and 
said to the man that sacrificed  give 
flesh to roast for the priest  for he will 
not have sodden flesh of thee  but 
raw 16and if the man said unto him  
let the fat be made to smoke first of 
all and then take as much as thy soul 
desireth  then he would say  nay but 
thou shalt give it me now  and if not  i 
will take it by force  17and the sin of 
the young men was very great before 
the lord for the men dealt 
contemptuously with the offering of 
the lord  
18but samuel ministered before the 
lord being a child  girded  with a 
linen ephod  19moreover his mother 
made him a little robe  and brought it 
to him from year to year  when she 
came up with her husband to offer the 
yearly sacrifice  20and eli would bless 
elkanah and his wife  and say  the 
lord give thee seed of th is woman for 
the loan which was lent to the lord 
and they would go unto their own 
home  21so the lord remembered 
hannah  and she conceived  and bore 
three sons and two daughters  and the 
child samuel grew before the lord  
22now eli was very old  and he 
heard all that his sons did unto all 
israel  and how that they lay with the 
women that did service at the door of 
the tent of meeting  23and he said unto 
them  why do ye such things  for i first samuel  
385 
 hear evil reports concerning you from 
all this people  24nay my s ons for it is 
no good report which i hear the 
lords people do spread abroad  25if 
one man sin against another  god shall 
judge him  but if a man sin against the 
lord who shall entreat for him  but 
they hearkened not unto the voice of 
their father  because the lord would 
slay them  26and the child samuel 
grew on  and increased in favour both 
with the lord and also with men   
27and there came a man of god unto 
eli and said unto him  thus saith the 
lord did i reveal myself unto the 
house of thy father  when they were in 
egypt in bondage to pharaoh s house  
28and did i choose him out of all the 
tribes of israel to be my priest  to go 
up unto mine altar  to burn incense  to 
wear an ephod before me  and did i 
give unto the house of thy father all 
the offer ings of the children of israel 
made by fire  29wherefore kick ye at 
my sacrifice and at mine offering  
which i have commanded in my 
habitation  and honourest thy sons 
above me  to make yourselves fat with 
the chiefest of all the offerings of 
israel my peop le 30therefore the 
lord the god of israel  saith  i said 
indeed that thy house  and the house of 
thy father  should walk before me for 
ever but now the lord saith  be it far 
from me  for them that honour me i 
will honour  and they that despise me 
shall be lightly esteemed  31behold  the 
days come  that i will cut off thine 
arm and the arm of thy father s house  that there shall not be an old man in 
thy house  32and thou shalt behold a 
rival in my habitation  in all the good 
which shall be done to israel  and there 
shall not be an old man in thy house 
for ever  33yet will i not cut off every 
man of thine from mine altar  to make 
thine eyes to fail  and thy heart to 
languish  and all the increase of thy 
house shall die young men  34and this 
shall be the si gn unto thee  that which 
shall come upon thy two sons  on 
hophni and phinehas  in one day they 
shall die both of them  35and i will 
raise me up a faithful priest  that shall 
do according to that which is in my 
heart and in my mind  and i will build 
him a s ure house  and he shall walk 
before mine anointed for ever  36and it 
shall come to pass  that every one that 
is left in thy house shall come and bow 
down to him for a piece of silver and a 
loaf of bread  and shall say  put me  i 
pray thee  into one of the 
priests offices  that i may eat a morsel 
of bread   
and the child samuel ministered 
unto the lord before eli  and the 
word of the lord was precious in 
those days  there was no frequent 
vision  2and it came to pass at that 
time when eli was laid down in  his 
place now his eyes had begun to wax 
dim that he could not see  3and the 
lamp of god was not yet gone out  and 
samuel was laid down to sleep in the 
temple of the lord where the ark of 
god was  4that the lord called 
samuel  and he said  here am i  3 first samuel  
386 
 5and he ran unto eli  and said  here 
am i  for thou didst call me  and he 
said i called not  lie down again  
and he went and lay down  6and the 
lord called yet again samuel  and 
samuel arose and went to eli  and 
said here am i  for thou didst call 
me and he answered  i called not  
my son  lie down again  7now samuel 
did not yet know the lord neither was 
the word of the lord yet revealed unto 
him 8and the lord called samuel 
again the third time  and he arose and 
went to eli  and said  here am i  for 
thou didst call me  and eli perceived 
that the lord was calling the child  
9therefore eli said unto samuel  go 
lie down  and it shall be  if thou be 
called  that thou shalt say  speak  
lord for thy servant heareth  so 
samuel went and lay down in his 
place  10and the lord came  and stood  
and called as at other times  samuel  
samuel  then samuel said  speak 
for thy servant heareth  11and the 
lord said to samuel  behold  i will 
do a thing in israel  at which both the 
ears of every one that hea reth it shall 
tingle  12in that day i will perform 
against eli all that i have spoken 
concerning his house  from the 
beginning even unto the end  13for i 
have told him that i will judge his 
house for ever  for the iniquity  in that 
he knew that his sons di d bring a curse 
upon themselves  and he rebuked them 
not 14and therefore i have sworn unto 
the house of eli  that the iniquity of 
elis house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever  15and 
samuel lay until the morning  and 
opened the d oors of the house of the 
lord and samuel feared to tell eli the 
vision  16then eli called samuel  and 
said samuel  my son  and he said  
here am i  17and he said  what is 
the thing that he hath spoken unto 
thee i pray thee  hide it not from me  
god do so to thee  and more also  if 
thou hide any thing from me of all the 
things that he spoke unto thee  18and 
samuel told him all the words  and hid 
nothing from him  and he said  it is 
the lord let him do what seemeth 
him good   
19and samuel grew  and the lord 
was with him  and did let none of his 
words fall to the ground  20and all 
israel from dan even to beer sheba 
knew that samuel was established to 
be a prophet of the lord 21and the 
lord appeared again in shiloh  for the 
lord revealed himself to s amuel in 
shiloh by the word of the lord  
and the word of samuel came to 
all israel   
now israel went out against the 
philistines to battle  and pitched beside 
eben ezer and the philistines pitched 
in aphek  2and the philistines put 
themselves in array against israel  and 
when the battle was spread  israel was 
smitten before the philistines  and they 
slew of the army in the field about four 
thousand men  3and when the people 
were come into the camp  the elders of 
israel said  wherefore hath the lord 
smitten us to day before the 4 first samuel  
387 
 philistines  let us fetch the ark of the 
covenant of the lord out of shiloh 
unto us  that he may come among us  
and save us out of the hand of our 
enemies  4so the people sent to 
shiloh  and they brought from thence 
the ark of th e covenant of the lord of 
hosts  who sitteth upon the cherubim  
and the two sons of eli  hophni and 
phinehas  were there with the ark of 
the covenant of god  5and when the 
ark of the covenant of the lord came 
into the camp  all israel shouted with a 
great shout  so that the earth rang  
6and when the philistines heard the 
noise of the shout  they said  what 
meaneth the noise of this great shout in 
the camp of the hebrews  and they 
knew that the ark of the lord was 
come into the camp  7and the 
philistines w ere afraid  for they said  
god is come into the camp  and they 
said woe unto us  for there was not 
such a thing yesterday and the day 
before  8woe unto us  who shall 
deliver us out of the hand of these 
mighty gods  these are the gods that 
smote the egy ptians with all manner 
of plagues and in the wilderness  9be 
strong  and quit yourselves like men  
o ye philistines  that ye be not 
servants unto the hebrews  as they 
have been to you  quit yourselves like 
men and fight  10and the philistines 
fought  and israel was smitten  and 
they fled every man to his tent  and 
there was a very great slaughter  for 
there fell of israel thirty thousand 
footmen  11and the ark of god was taken  and the two sons of eli  hophni 
and phinehas  were slain   
12and there ran a m an of benjamin 
out of the army  and came to shiloh 
the same day with his clothes rent  and 
with earth upon his head  13and when 
he came  lo eli sat upon his seat by 
the wayside watching  for his heart 
trembled for the ark of god  and when 
the man came int o the city  and told it  
all the city cried out  14and when eli 
heard the noise of the crying  he said  
what meaneth the noise of this 
tumult  and the man made haste  and 
came and told eli  15now eli was 
ninety and eight years old  and his 
eyes were set  that he could not see  
16and the man said unto eli  i am he 
that came out of the army  and i fled 
today out of the army  and he said  
how went the matter  my son  17and 
he that brought the tidings answered 
and said  israel is fled before the 
philist ines and there hath been also a 
great slaughter among the people  and 
thy two sons also  hophni and 
phinehas  are dead  and the ark of god 
is taken  18and it came to pass  when 
he made mention of the ark of god  
that he fell from off his seat backward 
by the side of the gate  and his neck 
broke  and he died  for he was an old 
man and heavy  and he had judged 
israel forty years   
19and his daughter inlaw 
phinehas wife was with child  near to 
be delivered  and when she heard the 
tidings that the ark of god was taken  
and that her father inlaw and her first samuel  
388 
 husband were dead  she bowed herself 
and brought forth  for her pains came 
suddenly upon her  20and about the 
time of her death the women that stood 
by her said unto her  fear not  for 
thou hast brought fo rth a son  but she 
answered not  neither did she regard it  
21and she named the child aichabod  
saying  the glory is departed from 
israel  because the ark of god was 
taken  and because of her father inlaw 
and her husband  22and she said  the 
glory is departed from israel  for the 
ark of god is taken   
now the philistines had taken the 
ark of god  and they brought it 
from eben ezer unto ashdod  2and the 
philistines took the ark of god  and 
brought it into the house of dagon  
and set it by dagon  3and when they 
of ashdod arose early on the morrow  
behold  dagon was fallen upon his 
face to the ground before the ark of the 
lord and they took dagon  and set 
him in his place again  4and when they 
arose early on the morrow morning  
behold  dagon was fallen  upon his 
face to the ground before the ark of the 
lord and the head of dagon and both 
the palms of his hands lay cut off upon 
the threshold  only the trunk of dagon 
was left to him  5therefore neither the 
priests of dagon  nor any that come 
into dagon s house  tread on the 
threshold of dagon in ashdod unto 
this day   
                                                      
a that is there is no glory  6but the hand of the lord was heavy 
upon them of ashdod  and he 
destroyed them  and smote them with 
emerods  even ashdod and the borders 
thereof  7and when the men of ashdod 
saw that it was s o they said  the ark 
of the god of israel shall not abide 
with us  for his hand is sore upon us  
and upon dagon our god  8they sent 
therefore and gathered all the lords of 
the philistines unto them  and said  
what shall we do with the ark of the 
god of  israel  and they answered  
let the ark of the god of israel be 
carried about unto gath  and they 
carried the ark of the god of israel 
about thither  9and it was so  that after 
they had carried it about  the hand of 
the lord was against the city with a  
very great discomfiture  and he smote 
the men of the city  both small and 
great  and emerods broke out upon 
them  10so they sent the ark of god to 
ekron  and it came to pass  as the ark 
of god came to ekron  that the 
ekronites cried out  saying  they 
have brought about the ark of the god 
of israel to us  to slay us and our 
people  11they sent therefore and 
gathered together all the lords of the 
philistines  and they said  send away 
the ark of the god of israel  and let it 
go back to its own place  that it slay us 
not and our people  for there was a 
deadly discomfiture throughout all the 
city the hand of god was very heavy 
there  12and the men that died not 
were smitten with the emerods  and 
the cry of the city went up to heaven   5 first samuel  
389 
 and the ark of the lord was in 
the country of the philistines 
seven months  2and the philistines 
called for the priests and the diviners  
saying  what shall we do with the ark 
of the lord declare unto us 
wherewith we shall send it to its 
place  3and they said  if ye send  
away the ark of the god of israel  send 
it not empty  but in any wise return 
him a guilt offering  then ye shall be 
healed  and it shall be known to you 
why his hand is not removed from 
you 4then said they  what shall be 
the guilt offering which we sha ll 
return to him  and they said  five 
golden emerods  and five golden mice  
according to the number of the lords of 
the philistines  for one plague was on 
you all  and on your lords  5wherefore 
ye shall make images of your emerods  
and images of your mic e that mar the 
land and ye shall give glory unto the 
god of israel  peradventure he will 
lighten his hand from off you  and 
from off your gods  and from off your 
land 6wherefore then do ye harden 
your hearts  as the egyptians and 
pharaoh hardened their h earts  when 
he had wrought among them  did they 
not let the people go  and they 
departed  7now therefore take and 
prepare you a new cart  and two milch 
kine on which there hath come no 
yoke  and tie the kine to the cart  and 
bring their calves home from t hem 
8and take the ark of the lord and lay 
it upon the cart  and put the jewels of 
gold which ye return him for a guilt offering  in a coffer by the side 
thereof  and send it away  that it may 
go 9and see  if it goeth up by the way 
of its own border to beth shemesh  
then he hath done us this great evil  
but if not  then we shall know that it is 
not his hand that smote us  it was a 
chance that happened to us   
10and the men did so  and took two 
milch kine  and tied them to the cart  
and shut up their cal ves at home  
11and they put the ark of the lord 
upon the cart  and the coffer with the 
mice of gold and the images of their 
emerods  12and the kine took the 
straight way by the way to beth 
shemesh  they went along the 
highway  lowing as they went  and 
turned not aside to the right hand or to 
the left  and the lords of the philistines 
went after them unto the border of 
beth shemesh  13and they of beth 
shemesh were reaping their wheat 
harvest in the valley  and they lifted up 
their eyes  and saw the ark  and 
rejoiced to see it  14and the cart came 
into the field of joshua the beth 
shemite  and stood there  where there 
was a great stone  and they cleaved the 
wood of the cart  and offered up the 
kine for a burnt offering unto the 
lord 15and the levites took dow n the 
ark of the lord and the coffer that 
was with it  wherein the jewels of gold 
were  and put them on the great stone  
and the men of beth shemesh offered 
burnt offerings and sacrificed 
sacrifices the same day unto the lord 
16and when the five lords of  the 6 first samuel  
390 
 philistines had seen it  they returned to 
ekron the same day   
17and these are the golden emerods 
which the philistines returned for a 
guiltoffering unto the lord for 
ashdod one  for gaza one  for 
ashkelon one  for gath one  for ekron 
one 18and the  golden mice  according 
to the number of all the cities of the 
philistines belonging to the five lords  
both of fortified cities and of country 
villages  even unto abel by the great 
stone  whereon they set down the ark 
of the lord which stone remaineth 
unto this day in the field of joshua the 
beth shemite  19and he smote of the 
men of beth shemesh  because they 
had gazed upon the ark of the lord 
even he smote of the people seventy 
men and fifty thousand men  and the 
people amourned  because the lord 
had smitten the people with a great 
slaughter  20and the men of beth 
shemesh said  who is able to stand 
before the lord this holy god  and to 
whom shall it go up from us  21and 
they sent messengers to the inhabitants 
of kiriath jearim  saying  the 
philisti nes have brought back the ark 
of the lord come ye down  and fetch 
it up to you   
and the men of kiriath jearim 
came  and fetched up the ark of 
the lord and brought it into the house 
of abinadab in the hill  and sanctified 
eleazar his son to keep the a rk of the 
lord  
                                                      
a from the hebrew root abel 2and it came to pass  from the day 
that the ark abode in kiriath jearim  
that the time was long  for it was 
twenty years  and all the house of 
israel yearned after the lord 3and 
samuel spoke unto all the house of 
israel  saying  if ye do  return unto the 
lord with all your heart  then put 
away the foreign gods and the 
ashtaroth from among you  and direct 
your hearts unto the lord and serve 
him only  and he will deliver you out 
of the hand of the philistines  4then 
the children of israel did put away the 
baalim and the ashtaroth  and served 
the lord only  
5and samuel said  gather all israel 
to mizpah  and i will pray for you unto 
the lord 6and they gathered together 
to mizpah  and drew water  and 
poured it out before the lord and 
fasted on that day  and said there  we 
have sinned against the lord and 
samuel judged the children of israel in 
mizpah   
7and when the philistines heard that 
the children of israel were gathered 
together to mizpah  the lords of the 
philistines went up again st israel  and 
when the children of israel heard it  
they were afraid of the philistines  
8and the children of israel said to 
samuel  cease not to cry unto the 
lord our god for us  that he save us 
out of the hand of the philistines  
9and samuel took a su cking lamb  and 
offered it for a whole burnt offering 
unto the lord and samuel cried unto 
the lord for israel  and the lord 7 first samuel  
391 
 answered him  10and as samuel was 
offering up the burnt offering  the 
philistines drew near to battle against 
israel  but the lord thundered with a 
great thunder on that day upon the 
philistines  and discomfited them  and 
they were smitten down before israel  
11and the men of israel went out of 
mizpah  and pursued the philistines  
and smote them  until they came under 
beth car 12then  samuel took a stone  
and set it between mizpah and shen  
and called the name of it aeben ezer 
saying  hitherto hath the lord helped 
us 13so the philistines were subdued  
and they came no more within the 
border of israel  and the hand of the 
lord was a gainst the philistines all the 
days of samuel  14and the cities which 
the philistines had taken from israel 
were restored to israel  from ekron 
even unto gath  and the border thereof 
did israel deliver out of the hand of the 
philistines  and there was peac e 
between israel and the amorites  
15and samuel judged israel all the 
days of his life  16and he went from 
year to year in circuit to beth el and 
gilgal  and mizpah  and he judged 
israel in all those places  17and his 
return was to ramah  for there was hi s 
house  and there he judged israel  and 
he built there an altar unto the lord  
and it came to pass  when 
samuel was old  that he made his 
sons judges over israel  2now the 
name of his first born was joel  and 
                                                      
a that is the stone of help  the name of his second  abijah  they 
were j udges in beer sheba  3and his 
sons walked not in his ways  but 
turned aside after lucre  and took 
bribes  and perverted justice   
4then all the elders of israel 
gathered themselves together  and 
came to samuel unto ramah  5and 
they said unto him  behold  thou art 
old and thy sons walk not in thy ways  
now make us a king to judge us like all 
the nations  6but the thing displeased 
samuel  when they said  give us a 
king to judge us  and samuel prayed 
unto the lord 7and the lord said unto 
samuel  hearken  unto the voice of 
the people in all that they say unto 
thee for they have not rejected thee  
but they have rejected me  that i 
should not be king over them  
8according to all the works which they 
have done since the day that i brought 
them up out of egyp t even unto this 
day in that they have forsaken me  
and served other gods  so do they also 
unto thee  9now therefore hearken 
unto their voice  howbeit thou shalt 
earnestly forewarn them  and shalt 
declare unto them the manner of the 
king that shall reign over them   
10and samuel told all the words of 
the lord unto the people that asked of 
him a king  11and he said  this will 
be the manner of the king that shall 
reign over you  he will take your sons  
and appoint them unto him  for his 
chariots  and to be  his horsemen  and 
they shall run before his chariots  
12and he will appoint them unto him 8 first samuel  
392 
 for captains of thousands  and captains 
of fifties  and to plow his ground  and 
to reap his harvest  and to make his 
instruments of war  and the 
instruments of his c hariots  13and he 
will take your daughters to be 
perfumers  and to be cooks  and to be 
bakers  14and he will take your fields  
and your vineyards  and your 
oliveyards  even the best of them  and 
give them to his servants  15and he 
will take the tenth of yo ur seed  and of 
your vineyards  and give to his 
officers  and to his servants  16and he 
will take your men servants  and your 
maid servants  and your goodliest 
young men  and your asses  and put 
them to his work  17he will take the 
tenth of your flocks  and ye shall be 
his servants  18and ye shall cry out in 
that day because of your king whom 
ye shall have chosen you  and the 
lord will not answer you in that day  
19but the people refused to hearken 
unto the voice of samuel  and they 
said nay but there s hall be a king 
over us  20that we also may be like all 
the nations  and that our king may 
judge us  and go out before us  and 
fight our battles  21and samuel heard 
all the words of the people  and he 
spoke them in the ears of the lord 
22and the lord said to samuel  
hearken unto their voice  and make 
them a king  and samuel said unto 
the men of israel  go ye every man 
unto his city   
now there was a man of 
benjamin  whose name was kish  the son of abiel  the son of zeror  the 
son of becorath  the son  of aphiah  the 
son of a benjamite  a mighty man of 
valour  2and he had a son  whose 
name was saul  young and goodly  and 
there was not among the children of 
israel a goodlier person than he  from 
his shoulders and upward he was 
higher than any of the peop le 3now 
the asses of kish saul s father were 
lost and kish said to saul his son  
take now one of the servants with 
thee and arise  go seek the asses  
4and he passed through the hill 
country of ephraim  and passed 
through the land of shalishah  but the y 
found them not  then they passed 
through the land of shaalim  and there 
they were not  and he passed through 
the land of the benjamites  but they 
found them not  5when they were 
come to the land of zuph  saul said to 
his servant that was with him  come 
and let us return  lest my father leave 
caring for the asses  and become 
anxious concerning us  6and he said 
unto him  behold now  there is in this 
city a man of god  and he is a man that 
is held in honour  all that he saith 
cometh surely to pass  now le t us go 
thither  peradventure he can tell us 
concerning our journey whereon we 
go 7then said saul to his servant  
but behold  if we go  what shall we 
bring the man  for the bread is spent in 
our vessels  and there is not a present 
to bring to the man o f god  what have 
we 8and the servant answered saul 
again  and said  behold  i have in my 9 first samuel  
393 
 hand the fourth part of a shekel of 
silver  that will i give to the man of 
god to tell us our way  
9beforetime in israel  when a man 
went to inquire of god  thus he said  
come and let us go to the seer  for he 
that is now called a prophet was 
beforetime called a seer 10then said 
saul to his servant  well said  come  
let us go  so they went unto the city 
where the man of god was  11as they 
went up the ascent t o the city  they 
found young maidens going out to 
draw water  and said unto them  is the 
seer here  12and they answered them  
and said  he is  behold  he is before 
thee make haste now  for he is come 
today into the city  for the people 
have a sacrific e today in the high 
place  13as soon as ye are come into 
the city  ye shall straightway find him  
before he go up to the high place to 
eat for the people will not eat until he 
come  because he doth bless the 
sacrifice  and afterwards they eat that 
are bi dden  now therefore get you up  
for at this time ye shall find him  
14and they went up to the city  and as 
they came within the city  behold  
samuel came out toward them  to go 
up to the high place   
15now the lord had revealed unto 
samuel a day before sa ul came  
saying  16tomorrow about this time i 
will send thee a man out of the land of 
benjamin  and thou shalt anoint him to 
be prince over my people israel  and 
he shall save my people out of the 
hand of the philistines  for i have looked upon my people  because their 
cry is come unto me  17and when 
samuel saw saul  the lord spoke unto 
him behold the man of whom i said 
unto thee  this same shall have 
authority over my people  18then 
saul drew near to samuel in the gate  
and said  tell me  i pray the e where 
the seer s house is  19and samuel 
answered saul  and said  i am the 
seer go up before me unto the high 
place  for ye shall eat with me to day 
and in the morning i will let thee go  
and will tell thee all that is in thy heart  
20and as for thin e asses that were lost 
three days ago  set not thy mind on 
them  for they are found  and on 
whom is all the desire of israel  is it 
not on thee  and on all thy father s 
house  21and saul answered and said  
am not i a benjamite  of the smallest 
of the tri bes of israel  and my family 
the least of all the families of the tribe 
of benjamin  wherefore then speakest 
thou to me after this manner   
22and samuel took saul and his 
servant  and brought them into the 
chamber  and made them sit in the 
chiefest place among them that were 
bidden  who were about thirty persons  
23and samuel said unto the cook  
bring the portion which i gave thee  
of which i said unto thee  set it by 
thee 24and the cook took up the 
thigh  and that which was upon it  and 
set it before s aul and samuel  said 
behold that which hath been 
reserved  set it before thee and eat  
because unto the appointed time hath it first samuel  
394 
 been kept for thee  for i said  i have 
invited the people  so saul did eat 
with samuel that day  25and when 
they were come d own from the high 
place into the city  he spoke with saul 
upon the housetop  26and they arose 
early  and it came to pass about the 
break of day  that samuel called to 
saul on the housetop  saying  up that 
i may send thee away  and saul 
arose  and they w ent out both of them  
he and samuel  abroad  27as they were 
going down at the end of the city  
samuel said to saul  bid the servant 
pass on before us and he passed 
onbut stand thou still at this time  
that i may cause thee to hear the word 
of god   
then samuel took the vial of 
oil and poured it upon his 
head  and kissed him  and said  is it 
not that the lord hath anointed thee to 
be prince over his inheritance  2when 
thou art departed from me to day then 
thou shalt find two men by the tomb of 
rache l in the border of benjamin at 
zelzah  and they will say unto thee  
the asses which thou wentest to seek 
are found  and lo thy father hath left 
off caring for the asses  and is anxious 
concerning you  saying  what shall i 
do for my son  3then shalt thou  go on 
forward from thence  and thou shalt 
come to the terebinth of tabor  and 
there shall meet thee there three men 
going up to god to beth el one 
carrying three kids  and another 
carrying three loaves of bread  and 
another carrying a bottle of wine  4and they will salute thee  and give thee two 
cakes of bread  which thou shalt 
receive of their hand  5after that thou 
shalt come to the hill of god  where is 
the garrison of the philistines  and it 
shall come to pass  when thou art 
come thither to the city  that thou shalt 
meet a band of prophets coming down 
from the high place with a psaltery  
and a timbrel  and a pipe  and a harp  
before them  and they will be 
prophesying  6and the spirit of the 
lord will come mightily upon thee  
and thou shalt prophesy wit h them  
and shalt be turned into another man  
7and let it be  when these signs are 
come unto thee  that thou do as thy 
hand shall find  for god is with thee  
8and thou shalt go down before me to 
gilgal  and behold  i will come down 
unto thee  to offer bur ntofferings  and 
to sacrifice sacrifices of peace 
offerings  seven days shalt thou tarry  
till i come unto thee  and tell thee what 
thou shalt do   
9and it was so  that when he had 
turned his back to go from samuel  
god gave him another heart  and all 
those signs came to pass that day  
10and when they came thither to the 
hill behold  a band of prophets met 
him and the spirit of god came 
mightily upon him  and he prophesied 
among them  11and it came to pass  
when all that knew him beforetime 
saw that  behold he prophesied with 
the prophets  then the people said one 
to another  what is this that is come 
unto the son of kish  is saul also 10 first samuel  
395 
 among the prophets  12and one of the 
same place answered and said  and 
who is their father  therefore it 
became a p roverb  is saul also among 
the prophets  13and when he had 
made an end of prophesying  he came 
to the high place   
14and saul s uncle said unto him 
and to his servant  whither went ye  
and he said  to seek the asses  and 
when we saw that they were not  found  
we came to samuel  15and saul s 
uncle said  tell me  i pray thee  what 
samuel said unto you  16and saul 
said unto his uncle  he told us plainly 
that the asses were found  but 
concerning the matter of the kingdom  
whereof samuel spoke  he told him 
not  
17and samuel called the people 
together unto the lord to mizpah  
18and he said unto the children of 
israel  thus saith the lord the god 
of israel  i brought up israel out of 
egypt  and i delivered you out of the 
hand of the egyptians  and out o f the 
hand of all the kingdoms that 
oppressed you  19but ye have this day 
rejected your god  who himself 
saveth you out of all your calamities 
and your distresses  and ye have said 
unto him  nay but set a king over us  
now therefore present yourselves 
before the lord by your tribes  and by 
your thousands  20so samuel brought 
all the tribes of israel near  and the 
tribe of benjamin was taken  21and he 
brought the tribe of benjamin near by 
their families  and the family of the matrites was taken  and saul t he son 
of kish was taken  but when they 
sought him  he could not be found  
22therefore they asked of the lord 
further  is there yet a man come 
hither  and the lord answered  
behold  he hath hid himself among 
the baggage  23and they ran and 
fetched him thence  and when he stood 
among the people  he was higher than 
any of the people from his shoulders 
and upward  24and samuel said to all 
the people  see ye him whom the 
lord hath chosen  that there is none 
like him among all the people  and 
all the peopl e shouted  and said  long 
live the king   
25then samuel told the people the 
manner of the kingdom  and wrote it in 
a book  and laid it up before the lord 
and samuel sent all the people away  
every man to his house  26and saul 
also went to his house to g ibeah  and 
there went with him the men of valour  
whose hearts god had touched  27but 
certain base fellows said  how shall 
this man save us  and they despised 
him and brought him no present  but 
he was as one that held his peace   
then nahash the amm onite 
came up  and encamped 
against jabesh gilead  and all the men 
of jabesh said unto nahash  make a 
covenant with us  and we will serve 
thee 2and nahash the ammonite said 
unto them  on this condition will i 
make it with you  that all your right 
eyes be put out  and i will lay it for a 
reproach upon all israel  3and the 11 first samuel  
396 
 elders of jabesh said unto him  give 
us seven days respite  that we may 
send messengers unto all the borders 
of israel  and then  if there be none to 
deliver us  we will come out to t hee 
4then came the messengers to 
gibeath shaul  and spoke these words 
in the ears of the people  and all the 
people lifted up their voice  and wept  
5and behold  saul came following the 
oxen out of the field  and saul said  
what aileth the people that they 
weep  and they told him the words of 
the men of jabesh  6and the spirit of 
god came mightily upon saul when he 
heard those words  and his anger was 
kindled greatly  7and he took a yoke 
of oxen  and cut them in pieces  and 
sent them throughout all the  borders of 
israel by the hand of messengers  
saying  whosoever cometh not forth 
after saul and after samuel  so shall it 
be done unto his oxen  and the dread 
of the lord fell on the people  and 
they came out as one man  8and he 
numbered them in bezek  and the 
children of israel were three hundred 
thousand  and the men of judah thirty 
thousand  9and they said unto the 
messengers that came  thus shall ye 
say unto the men of jabesh gilead  to
morrow  by the time the sun is hot  ye 
shall have deliverance  and the 
messengers came and told the men of 
jabesh  and they were glad  10and the 
men of jabesh said  tomorrow we 
will come out unto you  and ye shall 
do with us all that seemeth good unto 
you  11and it was so on the morrow  that 
saul put the people in  three 
companies  and they came into the 
midst of the camp in the morning 
watch  and smote the ammonites until 
the heat of the day  and it came to 
pass that they that remained were 
scattered  so that two of them were not 
left together  12and the people sa id 
unto samuel  who is he that said  
shall saul reign over us  bring the 
men that we may put them to death  
13and saul said  there shall not a 
man be put to death this day  for to 
day the lord hath wrought deliverance 
in israel   
14then said samuel to  the people  
come and let us go to gilgal  and 
renew the kingdom there  15and all 
the people went to gilgal  and there 
they made saul king before the lord 
in gilgal  and there they sacrificed 
sacrifices of peace offerings before the 
lord and there saul and all the men 
of israel rejoiced greatly   
and samuel said unto all 
israel  behold  i have 
hearkened unto your voice in all that 
ye said unto me  and have made a king 
over you  2and now  behold  the king 
walketh before you  and i am old and 
grayheade d and behold  my sons are 
with you  and i have walked before 
you from my youth unto this day  
3here i am  witness against me before 
the lord and before his anointed  
whose ox have i taken  or whose ass 
have i taken  or whom have i 
defrauded  or whom hav e i oppressed  12 first samuel  
397 
 or of whose hand have i taken a 
ransom to blind mine eyes therewith  
and i will restore it you  4and they 
said thou hast not defrauded us  nor 
oppressed us  neither hast thou taken 
aught of any man s hand  5and he 
said unto them  the lord is witness 
against you  and his anointed is 
witness this day  that ye have not 
found aught in my hand  and they 
said he is witness   
6and samuel said unto the people  
it is the lord that made moses and 
aaron  and that brought your fathers 
up out of  the land of egypt  7now 
therefore stand still  that i may plead 
with you before the lord concerning 
all the righteous acts of the lord 
which he did to you and to your 
fathers  8when jacob was come into 
egypt  then your fathers cried unto the 
lord and th e lord sent moses and 
aaron  who brought forth your fathers 
out of egypt  and they were made to 
dwell in this place  9but they forgot the 
lord their god  and he gave them 
over into the hand of sisera  captain of 
the host of hazor  and into the hand of 
the philistines  and into the hand of the 
king of moab  and they fought against 
them  10and they cried unto the lord 
and said  we have sinned  because we 
have forsaken the lord and have 
served the baalim and the ashtaroth  
but now deliver us out of the hand of 
our enemies  and we will serve thee  
11and the lord sent jerubbaal  and 
bedan  and jephthah  and samuel  and 
delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side  and ye dwelt in 
safety  12and when ye saw that nahash 
the king of the children of a mmon 
came against you  ye said unto me  
nay but a king shall reign over us  
when the lord your god was your 
king 13now therefore behold the king 
whom ye have chosen  and whom ye 
have asked for  and behold  the lord 
hath set a king over you  14if ye will  
fear the lord and serve him  and 
hearken unto his voice  and not rebel 
against the commandment of the lord 
and both ye and also the king that 
reigneth over you be followers of the 
lord your god  15but if ye will not 
hearken unto the voice of the lord but 
rebel against the commandment of the 
lord then shall the hand of the lord 
be against you  and against your 
fathers  16now therefore stand still and 
see this great thing  which the lord 
will do before your eyes  17is it not 
wheat harvest to day i will  call unto 
the lord that he may send thunder 
and rain  and ye shall know and see 
that your wickedness is great  which 
ye have done in the sight of the lord 
in asking you a king  18so samuel 
called unto the lord and the lord 
sent thunder and rain that d ay and all 
the people greatly feared the lord and 
samuel  19and all the people said unto 
samuel  pray for thy servants unto the 
lord thy god  that we die not  for we 
have added unto all our sins this evil  
to ask us a king  20and samuel said 
unto the pe ople fear not  ye have 
indeed done all this evil  yet turn not first samuel  
398 
 aside from following the lord but 
serve the lord with all your heart  
21and turn ye not aside  for then should 
ye go after vain things which cannot 
profit nor deliver  for they are vain  
22for the lord will not forsake his 
people for his great name s sake  
because it hath pleased the lord to 
make you a people unto himself  
23moreover as for me  far be it from 
me that i should sin against the lord 
in ceasing to pray for you  but i will 
instruc t you in the good and the right 
way 24only fear the lord and serve 
him in truth with all your heart  for 
consider how great things he hath 
done for you  25but if ye shall still do 
wickedly  ye shall be swept away  both 
ye and your king   
saul was  ayears old when he 
began to reign  and two years 
he reigned over israel  2and saul 
chose him three thousand men of 
israel  whereof two thousand were 
with saul in michmas and in the 
mount of beth el and a thousand were 
with jonathan in gibeath benjamin  
and the rest of the people he sent every 
man to his tent  3and jonathan smote 
the garrison of the philistines that was 
in geba  and the philistines heard of it  
and saul blew the horn throughout all 
the land  saying  let the hebrews 
hear 4and all israel hea rd say that 
saul had smitten the garrison of the 
philistines  and that israel also had 
                                                      
a the number is wanting in the 
hebrew  made himself odious with the 
philistines  and the people were 
gathered together after saul to gilgal   
5and the philistines assembled 
themselves together to fight with 
israel  thirty thousand chariots  and six 
thousand horsemen  and people as the 
sand which is on the sea shore in 
multitude  and they came up  and 
pitched in michmas  eastward of beth 
aven  6when the men of israel saw that 
they were in a strait for the peopl e 
were distressed then the people did 
hide themselves in caves  and in 
thickets  and in rocks  and in holds  
and in pits  7now some of the hebrews 
had gone over the jordan to the land of 
gad and gilead  but as for saul  he 
was yet in gilgal  and all the pe ople 
followed him trembling   
8and he tarried seven days  
according to the set time that samuel 
had appointed  but samuel came not to 
gilgal  and the people were scattered 
from him  9and saul said  bring 
hither to me the burnt offering and the 
peace offer ings and he offered the 
burnt offering  10and it came to pass 
that as soon as he had made an end of 
offering the burnt offering  behold  
samuel came  and saul went out to 
meet him  that he might salute him  
11and samuel said  what hast thou 
done  and saul said  because i saw 
that the people were scattered from 
me and that thou camest not within 
the days appointed  and that the 
philistines assembled themselves 
together against michmas  12therefore 13 first samuel  
399 
 said i  now will the philistines come 
down upon me to gilgal  and i have 
not entreated the favour of the lord i 
forced myself therefore  and offered 
the burnt offering  13and samuel said 
to saul  thou hast done foolishly  
thou hast not kept the commandment 
of the lord thy god  which he 
commanded thee  for now would the 
lord have established thy kingdom 
upon israel for ever  14but now thy 
kingdom shall not continue  the lord 
hath sought him a man after his own 
heart  and the lord hath appointed him 
to be prince over his people  because 
thou hast not kept tha t which the lord 
commanded thee   
15and samuel arose  and got him up 
from gilgal unto gibeath benjamin  
and saul numbered the people that 
were present with him  about six 
hundred men  16and saul  and 
jonathan his son  and the people that 
were present with  them  abode in 
agibeath benjamin  but the philistines 
encamped in michmas  17and the 
spoilers came out of the camp of the 
philistines in three companies  one 
company turned unto the way that 
leadeth to ophrah  unto the land of 
shual  18and another company  turned 
the way to beth horon  and another 
company turned the way of the border 
that looketh down upon the valley of 
zeboim toward the wilderness   
19now there was no smith found 
throughout all the land of israel  for 
                                                      
a heb geba  the philistines said  lest the hebrew s 
make them swords or spears  20but all 
the israelites went down to the 
philistines  to sharpen every man his 
plowshare  and his coulter  and his 
axe and his mattock  21and the price 
of the filing was ba pim for the 
mattocks  and for the coulters  and fo r 
the forks with three teeth  and for the 
axes and to set the goads  22so it came 
to pass in the day of battle  that there 
was neither sword nor spear found in 
the hand of any of the people that were 
with saul and jonathan  but with saul 
and with jonathan  his son was there 
found  23and the garrison of the 
philistines went out unto the pass of 
michmas   
now it fell upon a day  that 
jonathan the son of saul said 
unto the young man that bore his 
armour  come and let us go over to 
the philistines garrison  that is on 
yonder side  but he told not his father  
2and saul tarried in the uttermost part 
of gibeah under the pomegranate tree 
which is in migron  and the people 
that were with him were about six 
hundred men  3and ahijah  the son of 
ahitub  ichabod s brother  the son of 
phinehas  the son of eli  the priest of 
the lord in shiloh  wearing an ephod  
and the people knew not that jonathan 
was gone  4and between the passes  by 
which jonathan sought to go over unto 
the philistines garrison  there was a 
rocky cr ag on the one side  and a rocky 
                                                      
b that is two thirds of a shekel  14 first samuel  
400 
 crag on the other side  and the name of 
the one was bozez  and the name of 
the other seneh  5the one crag rose up 
on the north in front of michmas  and 
the other on the south in front of geba   
6and jonathan said to the youn g 
man that bore his armour  come and 
let us go over unto the garrison of 
these uncircumcised  it may be that the 
lord will work for us  for there is no 
restraint to the lord to save by many 
or by few  7and his armour bearer 
said unto him  do all that is  in thy 
heart  turn thee  behold i am with thee 
according to thy heart  8then said 
jonathan  behold  we will pass over 
unto the men  and we will disclose 
ourselves unto them  9if they say thus 
unto us  tarry until we come to you  
then we will stand still  in our place  
and will not go up unto them  10but if 
they say thus  come up unto us  then 
we will go up  for the lord hath 
delivered them into our hand  and this 
shall be the sign unto us  11and both 
of them disclosed themselves unto the 
garrison of the philistines  and the 
philistines said  behold hebrews 
coming forth out of the holes where 
they hid themselves  12and the men of 
the garrison spoke to jonathan and his 
armour bearer  and said  come up to 
us and we will show you a thing  
and jonathan sa id unto his armour 
bearer  come up after me  for the 
lord hath delivered them into the hand 
of israel  13and jonathan climbed up 
upon his hands and upon his feet  and 
his armour bearer after him  and they fell before jonathan  and his armour 
bearer slew them after him  14and that 
first slaughter  which jonathan and his 
armour bearer made  was about twenty 
men within as it were half a furrow s 
length in an acre of land  15and there 
was a trembling in the camp in the 
field and among all the people  the 
garrison  and the spoilers  they also 
trembled  and the earth quaked  so it 
grew into a terror from god  16and the 
watchmen of saul in gibeath 
benjamin looked  and behold  the 
multitude melted away  and they went 
hither and thither   
17then said saul unto t he people 
that were with him  number now  and 
see who is gone from us  and when 
they had numbered  behold  jonathan 
and his armour bearer were not there  
18and saul said unto ahijah  bring 
hither the ark of god  for the ark of 
god was there at that tim e with the 
children of israel  19and it came to 
pass while saul talked unto the priest  
that the tumult that was in the camp of 
the philistines went on and increased  
and saul said unto the priest  
withdraw thy hand  20and saul and 
all the people that w ere with him were 
gathered together  and came to the 
battle  and behold  every man s sword 
was against his fellow  and there was a 
very great discomfiture  21now the 
hebrews that were with the philistines 
as beforetime  and that went up with 
them into the  camp round about  even 
they also turned to be with the 
israelites that were with saul and first samuel  
401 
 jonathan  22likewise all the men of 
israel that had hid themselves in the 
hillcountry of ephraim  when they 
heard that the philistines fled  even 
they also followed  hard after them in 
the battle  23so the lord saved israel 
that day  and the battle passed on as 
far as beth aven   
24and the men of israel were 
distressed that day  but saul adjured 
the people  saying  cursed be the man 
that eateth any food until it be e vening  
and i be avenged on mine enemies  
so none of the people tasted food  
25and all the people came into the 
forest  and there was honey upon the 
ground  26and when the people were 
come unto the forest  behold a flow of 
honey  but no man put his hand t o his 
mouth  for the people feared the oath  
27but jonathan heard not when his 
father charged the people with the 
oath and he put forth the end of the 
rod that was in his hand  and dipped it 
in the honeycomb  and put his hand to 
his mouth  and his eyes br ightened  
28then answered one of the people  
and said  thy father straitly charged 
the people with an oath  saying  
cursed be the man that eateth food this 
day and the people are faint  29then 
said jonathan  my father hath 
troubled the land  see i pra y you  how 
mine eyes are brightened  because i 
tasted a little of this honey  30how 
much more  if haply the people had 
eaten freely to day of the spoil of their 
enemies which they found  had there 
not been then a much greater slaughter among the philistine s 31and they 
smote of the philistines that day from 
michmas to aijalon  and the people 
were very faint  32and the people flew 
upon the spoil  and took sheep  and 
oxen  and calves  and slew them on the 
ground  and the people did eat them 
with the blood  33then they told saul  
saying  behold  the people sin against 
the lord in that they eat with the 
blood  and he said  ye have dealt 
treacherously  roll a great stone unto 
me this day  34and saul said  
disperse yourselves among the 
people  and say unto them  bring me 
hither every man his ox  and every 
man his sheep  and slay them here  and 
eat and sin not against the lord in 
eating with the blood  and all the 
people brought every man his ox with 
him that night  and slew them there  
35and saul built an altar unto the 
lord the same was the first altar that 
he built unto the lord  
36and saul said  let us go down 
after the philistines by night  and spoil 
them until the morning light  and let us 
not leave a man of them  and they 
said do whatsoever seem eth good 
unto thee  then said the priest  let 
us draw near hither unto god  37and 
saul asked counsel of god  shall i go 
down after the philistines  wilt thou 
deliver them into the hand of israel  
but he answered him not that day  
38and saul said  draw nigh hither  all 
ye chiefs of the people  and know and 
see wherein this sin hath been this day  
39for as the lord liveth  who saveth first samuel  
402 
 israel  though it be in jonathan my 
son he shall surely die  but there was 
not a man among all the people that 
answere d him  40then said he unto all 
israel  be ye on one side  and i and 
jonathan my son will be on the other 
side and the people said unto saul  
do what seemeth good unto thee  
41therefore saul said unto the lord 
the god of israel  declare the right  
and jonathan and saul were taken by 
lot but the people escaped  42and saul 
said cast lots between me and 
jonathan my son  and jonathan was 
taken  43then saul said to jonathan  
tell me what thou hast done  and 
jonathan told him  and said  i did 
certai nly taste a little honey with the 
end of the rod that was in my hand  
here am i  i will die  44and saul said  
god do so and more also  thou shalt 
surely die  jonathan  45and the people 
said unto saul  shall jonathan die  
who hath wrought this great sal vation 
in israel  far from it  as the lord 
liveth  there shall not one hair of his 
head fall to the ground  for he hath 
wrought with god this day  so the 
people rescued jonathan  that he died 
not 46then saul went up from 
following the philistines  and th e 
philistines went to their own place   
47so saul took the kingdom over 
israel  and fought against all his 
enemies on every side  against moab  
and against the children of ammon  
and against edom  and against the 
kings of zobah  and against the 
philistines  and whithersoever he turned himself  he put them to the 
worse  48and he did valiantly  and 
smote the amalekites  and delivered 
israel out of the hands of them that 
spoiled them   
49now the sons of saul were 
jonathan  and ishvi  and malchi shua 
and the n ames of his two daughters 
were these  the name of the first born 
merab  and the name of the younger 
michal  50and the name of saul s wife 
was ahinoam the daughter of 
ahimaaz  and the name of the captain 
of his host was aabner  the son of ner  
sauls uncle  51and kish was the 
father of saul  and ner the father of 
abner was the son of abiel   
52and there was sore war against the 
philistines all the days of saul  and 
when saul saw any mighty man  or 
any valiant man  he took him unto 
him  
and samuel said un to saul  
the lord sent me to anoint 
thee to be king over his people  over 
israel  now therefore hearken thou 
unto the voice of the words of the 
lord 2thus saith the lord of hosts  i 
remember that which amalek did to 
israel  how he set himself against him  
in the way  when he came up out of 
egypt  3now go and smite amalek  
and utterly destroy all that they have  
and spare them not  but slay both man 
and woman  infant and suckling  ox 
and sheep  camel and ass   
                                                      
a heb abiner  15 first samuel  
403 
 4and saul summoned the people  
and numbered th em in telaim  two 
hundred thousand footmen  and ten 
thousand men of judah  5and saul 
came to the city of amalek  and lay in 
wait in the valley  6and saul said unto 
the kenites  go depart  get you down 
from among the amalekites  lest i 
destroy you with th em for ye showed 
kindness to all the children of israel  
when they came up out of egypt  so 
the kenites departed from among the 
amalekites  7and saul smote the 
amalekites  from havilah as thou 
goest to shur  that is in front of egypt  
8and he took agag t he king of the 
amalekites alive  and utterly destroyed 
all the people with the edge of the 
sword  9but saul and the people spared 
agag  and the best of the sheep  and of 
the oxen  even the young of the second 
birth  and the lambs  and all that was 
good  and would not utterly destroy 
them  but every thing that was of no 
account and feeble  that they destroyed 
utterly   
10then came the word of the lord 
unto samuel  saying  11it repenteth 
me that i have set up saul to be king  
for he is turned back from follo wing 
me and hath not performed my 
commandments  and it grieved 
samuel  and he cried unto the lord all 
night  12and samuel rose early to meet 
saul in the morning  and it was told 
samuel  saying  saul came to carmel  
and behold  he is setting him up a 
monument  and is gone about  and 
passed on  and gone down to gilgal  13and samuel came to saul  and saul 
said unto him  blessed be thou of the 
lord i have performed the 
commandment of the lord 14and 
samuel said  what meaneth then this 
bleating of the s heep in mine ears  and 
the lowing of the oxen which i hear  
15and saul said  they have brought 
them from the amalekites  for the 
people spared the best of the sheep and 
of the oxen  to sacrifice unto the lord 
thy god  and the rest we have utterly 
destroy ed 16then samuel said unto 
saul stay and i will tell thee what 
the lord hath said to me this night  
and he said unto him  say on   
17and samuel said  though thou be 
little in thine own sight  art thou not 
head of the tribes of israel  and the 
lord anointed thee king over israel  
18and the lord sent thee on a journey  
and said  go and utterly destroy the 
sinners the amalekites  and fight 
against them until they be consumed  
19wherefore then didst thou not 
hearken to the voice of the lord but 
didst fly upon the spoil  and didst that 
which was evil in the sight of the 
lord 20and saul said unto samuel  
yea i have hearkened to the voice of 
the lord and have gone the way 
which the lord sent me  and have 
brought agag the king of amalek  and 
have utte rly destroyed the amalekites  
21but the people took of the spoil  
sheep and oxen  the chief of the 
devoted things  to sacrifice unto the 
lord thy god in gilgal  22and 
samuel said   first samuel  
404 
 hath the lord as great delight in 
burnt offerings and sacrifices   
as in hearkening to the voice of the 
lord  
behold  to obey is better than 
sacrifice   
and to hearken than the fat of rams   
23for rebellion is as the sin of 
witchcraft   
and stubbornness is as idolatry and 
teraphim   
because thou hast rejected the word 
of the lord he hath also rejected thee 
from being king  24and saul said unto 
samuel  i have sinned  for i have 
transgressed the commandment of the 
lord and thy words  because i feared 
the people  and hearkened to their 
voice  25now therefore  i pray thee  
pardon my sin  and return with me  
that i may worship the lord 26and 
samuel said unto saul  i will not 
return with thee  for thou hast rejected 
the word of the lord and the lord 
hath rejected thee from being king 
over israel  27and as samuel turned 
about to go away  he laid hold upon 
the skirt of his robe  and it rent  28and 
samuel said unto him  the lord hath 
rent the kingdom of israel from thee 
this day  and hath given it to a 
neighbour of thine  that is better than 
thou 29and also the glory of israel 
will not lie nor repent  for he is not a 
man that he should repent  30then he 
said i have sinned  yet honour me 
now i pray thee  before the elders of 
my people  and before israel  and 
return with me  that i may worship the lord thy god  31so samuel r eturned 
after saul  and saul worshipped the 
lord  
32then said samuel  bring ye hither 
to me agag the king of the 
amalekites  and agag came unto 
him in chains  and agag said  surely 
the bitterness of death is at hand  
33and samuel said   
as thy sword h ath made women 
childless   
so shall thy mother be childless 
among women   
and samuel hewed agag in pieces 
before the lord in gilgal   
34then samuel went to ramah  and 
saul went up to his house to gibeath 
shaul  35and samuel never beheld saul 
again until th e day of his death  for 
samuel mourned for saul  and the 
lord repented that he had made saul 
king over israel   
and the lord said unto 
samuel  how long wilt thou 
mourn for saul  seeing i have rejected 
him from being king over israel  fill 
thy horn with  oil and go  i will send 
thee to jesse the beth lehemite  for i 
have provided me a king among his 
sons 2and samuel said  how can i 
go if saul hear it  he will kill me  
and the lord said take a heifer with 
thee and say  i am come to sacrifice to 
the lord 3and call jesse to the 
sacrifice  and i will tell thee what thou 
shalt do  and thou shalt anoint unto me 
him whom i name unto thee  4and 
samuel did that which the lord spoke  
and came to beth lehem  and the 16 first samuel  
405 
 elders of the city came to meet him 
trembling  and said  comest thou 
peaceably  5and he said  peaceably  
i am come to sacrifice unto the lord 
sanctify yourselves and come with me 
to the sacrifice  and he sanctified 
jesse and his sons  and called them to 
the sacrifice  6and it came to pass  
when they were come  that he beheld 
eliab  and said  surely the l ords 
anointed is before him  7but the lord 
said unto samuel  look not on his 
countenance  or on the height of his 
stature  because i have rejected him  
for it is not as man seeth  for man  
looketh on the outward appearance  
but the lord looketh on the heart  
8then jesse called abinadab  and 
made him pass before samuel  and he 
said neither hath the lord chosen 
this 9then jesse made shammah to 
pass by  and he said  neither hath the 
lord chosen this  10and jesse made 
seven of his sons to pass before 
samuel  and samuel said unto jesse  
the lord hath not chosen these  
11and samuel said unto jesse  are 
here all thy children  and he said  
there remaineth yet the youngest  
and behold  he keepeth the sheep  
and samuel said unto jesse  send 
and fetch him  for we will not sit down 
till he come hither  12and he sent  and 
brought him in  now he was ruddy  
and withal of beautiful eyes  and 
goodly to look upon  and the lord 
said arise  anoint him  for this is he  
13then samuel took the horn of oil  
and anointed him in the midst of his brethren  and the spirit of the lord 
came mightily upon david from that 
day forward  so samuel rose up  and 
went to ramah   
14now the spirit of the lord had 
departed from saul  and an evil spirit 
from the lord terrified him  15and 
sauls servants said unto him  behold 
now an evil spirit from god terrifieth 
thee 16let our lord now command thy 
servants  that are before thee  to seek 
out a man who is a skilful  player on 
the harp  and it shall be  when the evil 
spirit from god cometh upon thee  that 
he shall play with his hand  and thou 
shalt be well  17and saul said unto his 
servants  provide me now a man that 
can play well  and bring him to me  
18then answe red one of the young 
men and said  behold  i have seen a 
son of jesse the beth lehemite  that is 
skilful in playing  and a mighty man of 
valour  and a man of war  and prudent 
in affairs  and a comely person  and 
the lord is with him  19wherefore 
saul se nt messengers unto jesse  and 
said send me david thy son  who is 
with the sheep  20and jesse took an 
ass laden with bread  and a bottle of 
wine  and a kid  and sent them by 
david his son unto saul  21and david 
came to saul  and stood before him  
and he loved him greatly  and he 
became his armour bearer  22and saul 
sent to jesse  saying  let david  i 
pray thee  stand before me  for he hath 
found favour in my sight  23and it 
came to pass  when the evil spirit 
from god was upon saul  that david first samuel  
406 
 took the  harp and played with his 
hand  so saul found relief  and it was 
well with him  and the evil spirit 
departed from him   
now the philistines gathered 
together their armies to battle  
and they were gathered together at 
socoh  which belongeth to judah  and 
pitched between socoh and azekah  in 
ephes dammim  2and saul and the 
men of israel were gathered together  
and pitched in the vale of elah  and set 
the battle in array against the 
philistines  3and the philistines stood 
on the mountain on the one side  and 
israel stood on the mountain on the 
other side  and there was a valley 
between them  4and there went out a 
champion from the camp of the 
philistines  named goliath  of gath  
whose height was six cubits and a 
span 5and he had a helmet of brass 
upon his head  and he was clad with a 
coat of mail  and the weight of the coat 
was five thousand shekels of brass  
6and he had greaves of brass upon his 
legs and a javelin of brass between his 
shoulders  7and the shaft of his spear 
was like a weaver s beam  and hi s 
spear s head weighed six hundred 
shekels of iron  and his shield bearer 
went before him  8and he stood and 
cried unto the armies of israel  and 
said unto them  why do ye come out 
to set your battle in array  am not i a 
philistine  and ye servants to sau l 
choose you a man for you  and let him 
come down to me  9if he be able to 
fight with me  and kill me  then will we be your servants  but if i prevail 
against him  and kill him  then shall ye 
be our servants  and serve us  10and 
the philistine said  i do taunt the 
armies of israel this day  give me a 
man that we may fight together  
11and when saul and all israel heard 
those words of the philistine  they 
were dismayed  and greatly afraid   
12now david was the son of that 
ephrathite of beth lehem in juda h 
whose name was jesse  and he had 
eight sons  and the man was an old 
man in the days of saul  stricken in 
years among men  13and the three 
eldest sons of jesse had gone after 
saul to the battle  and the names of his 
three sons that went to the battle wer e 
eliab the first born and next unto him 
abinadab  and the third shammah  
14and david was the youngest  and the 
three eldest followed saul 15now 
david went to and fro from saul to 
feed his father s sheep at beth 
lehem 16and the philistine drew 
near morn ing and evening  and 
presented himself forty days   
17and jesse said unto david his son  
take now for thy brethren an ephah 
of this parched corn  and these ten 
loaves  and carry them quickly to the 
camp to thy brethren  18and bring 
these ten cheeses unto the captain of 
their thousand  and to thy brethren 
shalt thou bring greetings  and take 
their pledge  19now saul  and they  and 
all the men of israel  are in the vale of 
elah fighting with the philistines  
20and david rose up early in the 17 first samuel  
407 
 morning  and le ft the sheep with a 
keeper  and took  and went  as jesse 
had commanded him  and he came to 
the barricade  as the host which was 
going forth to the fight shouted for the 
battle  21and israel and the philistines 
put the battle in array  army against 
army  22and david left his baggage in 
the hand of the keeper of the baggage  
and ran to the army  and came and 
greeted his brethren  23and as he 
talked with them  behold  there came 
up the champion  the philistine of 
gath  goliath by name  out of the 
ranks of the philistines  and spoke 
according to the same words  and 
david heard them  24and all the men 
of israel  when they saw the man  fled 
from him  and were sore afraid  25and 
the men of israel said  have ye seen 
this man that is come up  surely to 
taunt israel is he come up  and it shall 
be that the man who killeth him  the 
king will enrich him with great riches  
and will give him his daughter  and 
make his father s house free in israel   
26and david spoke to the men that 
stood by him  saying  what shall be 
done to the man that killeth this 
philistine  and taketh away the taunt 
from israel  for who is this 
uncircumcised philistine  that he 
should have taunted the armies of the 
living god  27and the people 
answered him after this manner  
saying  so shall it b e done to the man 
that killeth him  28and eliab his eldest 
brother heard when he spoke unto the 
men and eliab s anger was kindled against david  and he said  why art 
thou come down  and with whom hast 
thou left those few sheep in the 
wilderness  i know thy 
presumptuousness  and the 
naughtiness of thy heart  for thou art 
come down that thou mightest see the 
battle  29and david said  what have 
i now done  was it not but a word  
30and he turned away from him 
toward another  and spoke after the 
same manne r and the people answered 
him after the former manner   
31and when the words were heard 
which david spoke  they rehearsed 
them before saul  and he was taken to 
him 32and david said to saul  let no 
mans heart fail within him  thy 
servant will go and fig ht with this 
philistine  33and saul said to david  
thou art not able to go against this 
philistine to fight with him  for thou 
art but a youth  and he a man of war 
from his youth  34and david said unto 
saul thy servant kept his father s 
sheep  and whe n there came a lion  or 
a bear  and took a lamb out of the 
flock  35i went out after him  and 
smote him  and delivered it out of his 
mouth  and when he arose against me  
i caught him by his beard  and smote 
him and slew him  36thy servant 
smote both the l ion and the bear  and 
this uncircumcised philistine shall be 
as one of them  seeing he hath taunted 
the armies of the living god  37and 
david said  the lord that delivered 
me out of the paw of the lion  and out 
of the paw of the bear  he will deliver first samuel  
408 
 me out of the hand of this philistine  
and saul said unto david  go and 
the lord shall be with thee  38and 
saul clad david with his apparel  and 
he put a helmet of brass upon his head  
and he clad him with a coat of mail  
39and david girded his sword upon  his 
apparel  and he essayed to go  but 
could not  for he had not tried it  and 
david said unto saul  i cannot go 
with these  for i have not tried them  
and david put them off him  40and he 
took his staff in his hand  and chose 
him five smooth stones out of the 
brook  and put them in the shepherd s 
bag which he had  even in his scrip  
and his sling was in his hand  and he 
drew near to the philistine   
41and the philistine came nearer and 
nearer unto david  and the man that 
bore the shield went before h im 42and 
when the philistine looked about  and 
saw david  he disdained him  for he 
was but a youth  and ruddy  and withal 
of a fair countenance  43and the 
philistine said unto david  am i a 
dog that thou comest to me with 
staves  and the philistine cur sed 
david by his god  44and the philistine 
said to david  come to me  and i will 
give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air  
and to the beasts of the field  45then 
said david to the philistine  thou 
comest to me with a sword  and with a 
spear  and with a javelin  but i come to 
thee in the name of the lord of hosts  
the god of the armies of israel  whom 
thou hast taunted  46this day will the 
lord deliver thee into my hand  and i will smite thee  and take thy head from 
off thee  and i will give the carcasses  
of the host of the philistines this day 
unto the fowls of the air  and to the 
wild beasts of the earth  that all the 
earth may know that there is a god in 
israel  47and that all this assembly may 
know that the lord saveth not with 
sword and spear  for the  battle is the 
lords and he will give you into our 
hand  48and it came to pass  when the 
philistine arose  and came and drew 
nigh to meet david  that david 
hastened  and ran toward the army to 
meet the philistine  49and david put 
his hand in his bag  and took thence a 
stone  and slung it  and smote the 
philistine in his forehead  and the 
stone sank into his forehead  and he 
fell upon his face to the earth  50so 
david prevailed over the philistine 
with a sling and with a stone  and 
smote the philistine  and slew him  but 
there was no sword in the hand of 
david  51and david ran  and stood 
over the philistine  and took his sword  
and drew it out of the sheath thereof  
and slew him  and cut off his head 
therewith  and when the philistines 
saw that their might y man was dead  
they fled  52and the men of israel and 
of judah arose  and shouted  and 
pursued the philistines  until thou 
comest to gai  and to the gates of 
ekron  and the wounded of the 
philistines fell down by the way to 
shaaraim  even unto gath  and u nto 
ekron  53and the children of israel 
returned from chasing after the first samuel  
409 
 philistines  and they spoiled their 
camp  54and david took the head of 
the philistine  and brought it to 
jerusalem  but he put his armour in his 
tent  
55and when saul saw david go 
forth against the philistine  he said 
unto abner  the captain of the host  
abner  whose son is this youth  and 
abner said  as thy soul liveth  o 
king i cannot tell  56and the king 
said inquire thou whose son the 
stripling is  57and as david returned 
from the slaughter of the philistine  
abner took him  and brought him 
before saul with the head of the 
philistine in his hand  58and saul said 
to him  whose son art thou  thou 
young man  and david answered  i 
am the son of thy servant jesse the 
beth lehemite  
and it came to pass  when he 
had made an end of speaking 
unto saul  that the soul of jonathan 
was knit with the soul of david  and 
jonathan loved him as his own soul  
2and saul took him that day  and 
would let him go no more home to his 
father s house  3then jonathan made a 
covenant with david  because he loved 
him as his own soul  4and jonathan 
stripped himself of the robe that was 
upon him  and gave it to david  and 
his apparel  even to his sword  and to 
his bow  and to his girdle  5and david 
went out  whithersoever saul sent him  
he had good success  and saul set him 
over the men of war  and it was good in the sight of all the people  and also 
in the sight of saul s servants   
6and it came to pass as they came  
when david returned from the 
slaughter of the philistine  that the 
women came out of all the cities of 
israel  singing and dancing  to meet 
king saul  with timbrels  with joy  and 
with three stringed instruments  7and 
the women sang one to another in their 
play and said   
saul hath slain  his thousands   
and david his ten thousands   
8and saul was very wroth  and this 
saying displeased him  and he said  
they have ascribed unto david ten 
thousands  and to me they have 
ascribed but thousands  and all he 
lacketh is the kingdom   9and saul 
eyed david from that day and forward   
10and it came to pass on the 
morrow  that an evil spirit from god 
came mightily upon saul  and he raved 
in the midst of the house  and david 
played with his hand  as he did day by 
day and saul had his spear in his 
hand 11and saul cast the spear  for he 
said i will smite david even to the 
wall and david stepped aside out of 
his presence twice  12and saul was 
afraid of david  because the lord was 
with him  and was departed from saul  
13therefore saul removed him fro m 
him and made him his captain over a 
thousand  and he went out and came in 
before the people  14and david had 
great success in all his ways  and the 
lord was with him  15and when saul 
saw that he had great success  he stood 18 first samuel  
410 
 in awe of him  16but all israe l and 
judah loved david  for he went out 
and came in before them   
17and saul said to david  behold 
my elder daughter merab  her will i 
give thee to wife  only be thou valiant 
for me  and fight the l ords battles  
for saul said  let not my hand be 
upon him but let the hand of the 
philistines be upon him  18and david 
said unto saul  who am i  and what is 
my life  or my father s family in israel  
that i should be son inlaw to the 
king 19but it came to pass at the time 
when merab saul s daughter shoul d 
have been given to david  that she was 
given unto adriel the meholathite to 
wife 20and michal saul s daughter 
loved david  and they told saul  and 
the thing pleased him  21and saul said  
i will give him her  that she may be a 
snare to him  and that the  hand of the 
philistines may be against him  
wherefore saul said to david  thou 
shalt this day be my son inlaw 
through the one of the twain  22and 
saul commanded his servants  speak 
with david secretly  and say  behold  
the king hath delight in thee  and all 
his servants love thee  now therefore 
be the king s son inlaw 23and saul s 
servants spoke those words in the ears 
of david  and david said  seemeth it 
to you a light thing to be the king s 
soninlaw seeing that i am a poor 
man and lightly es teemed  24and the 
servants of saul told him  saying  on 
this manner spoke david  25and saul 
said thus shall ye say to david  the king desireth not any dowry  but a 
hundred foreskins of the philistines  to 
be avenged of the king s enemies  for 
saul th ought to make david fall by the 
hand of the philistines  26and when his 
servants told david these words  it 
pleased david well to be the king s 
soninlaw and the days were not 
expired  27and david arose and went  
he and his men  and slew of the 
philistin es two hundred men  and 
david brought their foreskins  and 
they gave them in full number to the 
king that he might be the king s son 
inlaw and saul gave him michal his 
daughter to wife  28and saul saw and 
knew that the lord was with david  
and michal sa uls daughter loved him  
29and saul was yet the more afraid of 
david  and saul was david s enemy 
continually   
30then the princes of the philistines 
went forth  and it came to pass  as 
often as they went forth  that david 
prospered more than all the servan ts of 
saul so that his name was much set 
by  
and saul spoke to jonathan 
his son  and to all his servants  
that they should slay david  but 
jonathan saul s son delighted much in 
david  2and jonathan told david  
saying  saul my father seeketh to slay 
thee now therefore  i pray thee  take 
heed to thyself in the morning  and 
abide in a secret place  and hide 
thyself  3and i will go out and stand 
beside my father in the field where 
thou art  and i will speak with my 19 first samuel  
411 
 father of thee  and if i see aught  i will 
tell thee   
4and jonathan spoke good of david 
unto saul his father  and said unto 
him let not the king sin against his 
servant  against david  because he 
hath not sinned against thee  and 
because his work hath been very good 
towards thee  5for he pu t his life in his 
hand  and smote the philistine  and the 
lord wrought a great victory for all 
israel  thou sawest it  and didst rejoice  
wherefore then wilt thou sin against 
innocent blood  to slay david without 
a cause  6and saul hearkened unto 
the voic e of jonathan  and saul swore  
as the lord liveth  he shall not be put 
to death  7and jonathan called david  
and jonathan told him all those things  
and jonathan brought david to saul  
and he was in his presence  as 
beforetime   
8and there was war again  and 
david went out  and fought with the 
philistines  and slew them with a great 
slaughter  and they fled before him  
9and an evil spirit from the lord was 
upon saul  as he sat in his house with 
his spear in his hand  and david was 
playing with his hand  10and saul 
sought to smite david even to the wall 
with the spear  but he slipped away out 
of saul s presence  and he smote the 
spear into the wall  and david fled  
and escaped that night  11and saul sent 
messengers unto david s house  to 
watch him  and to s lay him in the 
morning  and michal david s wife told 
him saying  if thou save not thy life tonight  tomorrow thou shalt be 
slain  12so michal let david down 
through the window  and he went  and 
fled and escaped  13and michal took 
the teraphim  and la id it in the bed  and 
put a quilt of goats hair at the head 
thereof  and covered it with a cloth  
14and when saul sent messengers to 
take david  she said  he is sick  
15and saul sent the messengers to see 
david  saying  bring him up to me in 
the bed  that i may slay him  16and 
when the messengers came in  behold  
the teraphim was in the bed  with the 
quilt of goats hair at the head thereof  
17and saul said unto michal  why 
hast thou deceived me thus  and let 
mine enemy go  that he is escaped  
and mich al answered saul  he said 
unto me  let me go  why should i kill 
thee  
18now david fled  and escaped  and 
came to samuel to ramah  and told 
him all that saul had done to him  and 
he and samuel went and dwelt in 
naioth  19and it was told saul  saying  
behold david is at naioth in 
ramah  20and saul sent messengers 
to take david  and when they saw the 
company of the prophets prophesying  
and samuel standing as head over 
them  the spirit of god came upon the 
messengers of saul  and they also 
prophesied  21and when it was told 
saul he sent other messengers  and 
they also prophesied  and saul sent 
messengers again the third time  and 
they also prophesied  22then went he 
also to ramah  and came to the great first samuel  
412 
 cistern that is in secu  and he asked 
and said  whe re are samuel and 
david  and one said  behold  they 
are at naioth in ramah  23and he 
went thither to naioth in ramah  and 
the spirit of god came upon him also  
and he went on  and prophesied  until 
he came to naioth in ramah  24and he 
also stripped off his clothes  and he 
also prophesied before samuel  and 
lay down naked all that day and all 
that night  wherefore they say  is 
saul also among the prophets   
and david fled from naioth in 
ramah  and came and said 
before jonathan  what have i done  
what is mine iniquity  and what is my 
sin before thy father  that he seeketh 
my life  2and he said unto him  far 
from it  thou shalt not die  behold  my 
father doeth nothing either great or 
small  but that he discloseth it unto 
me and why should my father hide 
this thing from me  it is not so  3and 
david swore moreover  and said  thy 
father knoweth well that i have found 
favour in thine eyes  and he saith  let 
not jonathan know this  lest he be 
grieved  but truly as the lord liveth  
and as thy soul liveth  there is but a 
step between me and death  4then 
said jonathan unto david  what doth 
thy soul desire  that i should do it for 
thee 5and david said unto jonathan  
behold  tomorrow is the new moon  
when i should sit with the king to eat  
so let me go  that i may hide myself in 
the field unto the third day at even  6if 
thy father miss me at all  then say  david earnestly asked leave of me that 
he might run to beth lehem his city  
for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all 
the family  7if he say thus  it is well  
thy servant shall have peace  but if he 
be wroth  then know that evil is 
determined by him  8therefore deal 
kindly with thy servant  for thou hast 
brought thy servant into a covenant of 
the lord with thee  but if there be in 
me iniquity  slay m e thyself  for why 
shouldest thou bring me to thy father  
9and jonathan said  far be it from 
thee for if i should at all know that 
evil were determined by my father to 
come upon thee  then would not i tell 
it thee  10then said david to jonathan  
who sh all tell me if perchance thy 
father answer thee roughly  11and 
jonathan said unto david  come and 
let us go out into the field  and they 
went out both of them into the field   
12and jonathan said unto david  
the lord the god of israel when i 
have soun ded my father about this 
time to morrow  or the third day  
behold  if there be good toward david  
shall i not then send unto thee  and 
disclose it unto thee  13the lord do so 
to jonathan  and more also  should it 
please my father to do thee evil  if i 
disclose it not unto thee  and send thee 
away  that thou mayest go in peace  
and the lord be with thee  as he hath 
been with my father  14and thou shalt 
not only while yet i live show me the 
kindness of the lord that i die not  
15but also thou shalt not cut o ff thy 
kindness from my house for ever  no 20 first samuel  
413 
 not when the lord hath cut off the 
enemies of david every one from the 
face of the earth  16so jonathan made 
a covenant with the house of david  
the lord even require it at the hand 
of david s enemies  17and j onathan 
caused david to swear again  for the 
love that he had to him  for he loved 
him as he loved his own soul   
18and jonathan said unto him  to
morrow is the new moon  and thou 
wilt be missed  thy seat will be empty  
19and in the third day thou shalt h ide 
thyself well  and come to the place 
where thou didst hide thyself in the 
day of work  and shalt remain by the 
stone ezel  20and i will shoot three 
arrows to the side ward  as though i 
shot at a mark  21and behold  i will 
send the lad  go find the arr ows if i 
say unto the lad  behold  the arrows 
are on this side of thee  take them  and 
come  for there is peace to thee and no 
hurt as the lord liveth  22but if i say 
thus unto the boy  behold  the arrows 
are beyond thee  go thy way  for the 
lord hath se nt thee away  23and as 
touching the matter which i and thou 
have spoken of  behold  the lord is 
between me and thee for ever   
24so david hid himself in the field  
and when the new moon was come  
the king sat him down to the meal to 
eat 25and the king sa t upon his seat  as 
at other times  even upon the seat by 
the wall  and jonathan stood up  and 
abner sat by saul s side  but david s 
place was empty  26nevertheless saul 
spoke not any thing that day  for he thought  something hath befallen 
him he is uncl ean surely he is not 
clean  27and it came to pass on the 
morrow after the new moon  which 
was the second day  that david s place 
was empty  and saul said unto 
jonathan his son  wherefore cometh 
not the son of jesse to the meal  
neither yesterday  nor to day 28and 
jonathan answered saul  david 
earnestly asked leave of me to go to 
beth lehem  29and he said  let me go  
i pray thee  for our family hath a 
sacrifice in the city  and my brother  
he hath commanded me  and now  if i 
have found favour in thine eyes let me 
get away  i pray thee  and see my 
brethren  therefore he is not come 
unto the king s table   
30then saul s anger was kindled 
against jonathan  and he said unto 
him thou son of perverse rebellion  
do not i know that thou hast chosen 
the son of jesse to thine own shame  
and unto the shame of thy mother s 
nakedness  31for as long as the son of 
jesse liveth upon the earth  thou shalt 
not be established  nor thy kingdom  
wherefore now send and fetch him 
unto me  for he deserveth to die  
32and jo nathan answered saul his 
father  and said unto him  wherefore 
should he be put to death  what hath 
he done  33and saul cast his spear at 
him to smite him  whereby jonathan 
knew that it was determined of his 
father to put david to death  34so 
jonathan aro se from the table in fierce 
anger  and did eat no food the second first samuel  
414 
 day of the month  for he was grieved 
for david  and because his father had 
put him to shame   
35and it came to pass in the 
morning  that jonathan went out into 
the field at the time appointe d with 
david  and a little lad with him  36and 
he said unto his lad  run find now 
the arrows which i shoot  and as the 
lad ran  he shot an arrow beyond him  
37and when the lad was come to the 
place of the arrow which jonathan had 
shot jonathan cried af ter the lad  and 
said is not the arrow beyond thee  
38and jonathan cried after the lad  
make speed  hasten  stay not  and 
jonathan s lad gathered up the arrows  
and came to his master  39but the lad 
knew not any thing  only jonathan and 
david knew the  matter  40and 
jonathan gave his weapons unto his 
lad and said unto him  go carry 
them to the city  41and as soon as the 
lad was gone  david arose out of a 
place toward the south  and fell on his 
face to the ground  and bowed down 
three times  and they  kissed one 
another  and wept one with another  
until david exceeded  42and jonathan 
said to david  go in peace  forasmuch 
as we have sworn both of us in the 
name of the lord saying  the lord 
shall be between me and thee  and  
between my seed and thy 
seed for ever  1and he arose 
and departed  and jonathan went into 
the city   
2then came david to nob to 
ahimelech the priest  and ahimelech came to meet david trembling  and 
said unto him  why art thou alone  
and no man with thee  3 and david 
said unto  ahimelech the priest  the 
king hath commanded me a business  
and hath said unto me  let no man 
know any thing of the business 
whereabout i send thee  and what i 
have commanded thee  and the young 
men have i appointed to such and such 
a place  4 now there fore what is under 
thy hand  five loaves of bread  give 
them in my hand  or whatsoever there 
is present  5and the priest answered 
david  and said  there is no common 
bread under my hand  but there is holy 
bread  if only the young men have kept 
themselves  from women  6 and david 
answered the priest  and said unto him  
of a truth women have been kept 
from us about these three days  when i 
came out  the vessels of the young 
men were holy  though it was but a 
common journey  how much more 
then to day when there shall be holy 
bread in their vessels  7 so the priest 
gave him holy bread  for there was no 
bread there but the showbread  that 
was taken from before the lord to put 
hot bread in the day when it was taken 
away  8 now a certain man of the 
servants of saul was there that day  
detained before the lord and his 
name was doeg the edomite  the 
chiefest of the herdmen that belonged 
to saul  9 and david said unto 
ahimelech  and is there peradventure 
here under thy hand spear or sword  
for i have neither brought my sword 21  first samuel  
415 
 nor my weapons with me  because the 
kings business required haste  10and 
the priest said  the sword of goliath 
the philistine  whom thou slewest in 
the vale of elah  behold  it is here 
wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod  if 
thou wilt t ake that  take it  for there is 
no other save that here  and david 
said there is none like that  give it 
me  
11and david arose  and fled that day 
for fear of saul  and went to achish 
the king of gath  12and the servants of 
achish said unto him  is no t this 
david the king of the land  did they 
not sing one to another of him in 
dances  saying   
saul hath slain his thousands   
and david his ten thousands   
13and david laid up these words in 
his heart  and was sore afraid of 
achish the king of gath  14and he 
changed his demeanour before them  
and feigned himself mad in their 
hands  and scrabbled on the doors of 
the gate  and let his spittle fall down 
upon his beard  15then said achish 
unto his servants  lo when ye see a 
man that is mad  wherefore do ye 
bring him to me  16do i lack madmen  
that ye have brought this fellow to play 
the madman in my presence  shall this 
fellow come into my house   
 
david therefore departed 
thence  and escaped to the 
cave of adullam  and when his 
brethren and all his fath ers house 
heard it  they went down thither to him 2and every one that was in 
distress  and every one that was in 
debt and every one that was 
discontented  gathered themselves 
unto him  and he became captain over 
them  and there were with him about 
four hundred men   
3and david went thence to mizpeh 
of moab  and he said unto the king of 
moab  let my father and my mother  
i pray thee  come forth  and be with 
you till i know what god will do for 
me 4and he brought them before the 
king of moab  and they dwelt with him 
all the while that david was in the 
stronghold  5and the prophet gad said 
unto david  abide not in the 
stronghold  depart  and get thee into 
the land of judah  then david 
departed  and came into the forest of 
hereth   
6and saul heard that david was 
discovered  and the men that were with 
him now saul was sitting in gibeah  
under the tamarisk tree in ramah  with 
his spear in his hand  and all his 
servants were standing about him  
7and saul said unto his servants that 
stood about him  hear n ow ye 
benjamites  will the son of jesse give 
every one of you fields and vineyards  
will he make you all captains of 
thousands and captains of hundreds  
8that all of you have conspired against 
me and there was none that disclosed 
it to me when my son mad e a league 
with the son of jesse  and there is none 
of you that is sorry for me  or 
discloseth unto me that my son hath 22 first samuel  
416 
 stirred up my servant against me  to lie 
in wait  as at this day  9then 
answered doeg the edomite  who was 
set over the servants of sau l and said  
i saw the son of jesse coming to nob  
to ahimelech the son of ahitub  10and 
he inquired of the lord for him  and 
gave him victuals  and gave him the 
sword of goliath the philistine   
11then the king sent to call 
ahimelech the priest  the son  of 
ahitub  and all his father s house  the 
priests that were in nob  and they 
came all of them to the king  12and 
saul said  hear now  thou son of 
ahitub  and he answered  here i am  
my lord  13and saul said unto him  
why have ye conspired against me  
thou and the son of jesse  in that thou 
hast given him bread  and a sword  and 
hast inquired of god for him  that he 
should rise against me  to lie in wait  
as at this day  14then ahimelech 
answered the king  and said  and who 
among all thy servants is  so trusted as 
david  who is the king s son inlaw 
and giveth heed unto thy bidding  and 
is honourable in thy house  15have i 
today begun to inquire of god for 
him be it far from me  let not the king 
impute any thing unto his servant  nor 
to all the hou se of my father  for thy 
servant knoweth nothing of all this  
less or more  16and the king said  
thou shalt surely die  ahimelech  
thou and all thy father s house  17and 
the king said unto the guard that stood 
about him  turn  and slay the priests 
of the lord because their hand also is with david  and because they knew 
that he fled  and did not disclose it to 
me but the servants of the king 
would not put forth their hand to fall 
upon the priests of the lord 18and the 
king said to doeg  turn thou  and fall 
upon the priests  and doeg the 
edomite turned  and he fell upon the 
priests  and he slew on that day 
fourscore and five persons that did 
wear a linen ephod  19and nob  the 
city of the priests  smote he with the 
edge of the sword  both men and 
wom en children and sucklings  and 
oxen and asses and sheep  with the 
edge of the sword  20and one of the 
sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub  
named abiathar  escaped  and fled 
after david  21and abiathar told david 
that saul had slain the l ords priests  
22and david said unto abiathar  i 
knew on that day  when doeg the 
edomite was there  that he would 
surely tell saul  i have brought about 
the death of all the persons of thy 
father s house  23abide thou with me  
fear not  for he that seeketh my life 
seeketh thy life  for with me thou shalt 
be in safeguard   
and they told david  saying  
behold  the philistines are 
fighting against keilah  and they rob 
the threshing floors  2therefore david 
inquired of the lord saying  shall i 
go and smite these philist ines and 
the lord said unto david  go and 
smite the philistines  and save keilah  
3and david s men said unto him  
behold  we are afraid here in judah  23 first samuel  
417 
 how much more then if we go to 
keilah against the armies of the 
philistines  4then david inquired of 
the lord yet again  and the lord 
answered him and said  arise  go 
down to keilah  for i will deliver the 
philistines into thy hand  5and david 
and his men went to keilah  and 
fought with the philistines  and 
brought away their cattle  and slew 
them wi th a great slaughter  so david 
saved the inhabitants of keilah   
6and it came to pass  when abiathar 
the son of ahimelech fled to david to 
keilah  that he came down with an 
ephod in his hand  7and it was told 
saul that david was come to keilah  
and saul sa id god hath delivered 
him into my hand  for he is shut in  by 
entering into a town that hath gates 
and bars  8and saul summoned all the 
people to war  to go down to keilah  to 
besiege david and his men  9and 
david knew that saul devised mischief 
against  him and he said to abiathar 
the priest  bring hither the ephod  
10then said david  o lord the god 
of israel  thy servant hath surely heard 
that saul seeketh to come to keilah  to 
destroy the city for my sake  11will the 
men of keilah deliver me up in to his 
hand  will saul come down  as thy 
servant hath heard  o lord the god 
of israel  i beseech thee  tell thy 
servant  and the lord said he will 
come down  12then said david  will 
the men of keilah deliver up me and 
my men into the hand of saul  and 
the lord said they will deliver thee up 13then david and his men  who 
were about six hundred  arose and 
departed out of keilah  and went 
whithersoever they could go  and it 
was told saul that david was escaped 
from keilah  and he forbore to go 
forth  
14and david abode in the wilderness 
in the strongholds  and remained in the 
hillcountry in the wilderness of ziph  
and saul sought him every day  but 
god delivered him not into his hand  
15and david saw that saul was come 
out to seek his life  and dav id was in 
the wilderness of ziph in the wood  
16and jonathan saul s son arose  and 
went to david into the wood  and 
strengthened his hand in god  17and 
he said unto him  fear not  for the 
hand of saul my father shall not find 
thee and thou shalt be king over 
israel  and i shall be next unto thee  
and that also saul my father knoweth  
18and they two made a covenant 
before the lord and david abode in 
the wood  and jonathan went to his 
house   
19then came up the ziphites to saul 
to gibeah  saying  doth no t david 
hide himself with us in the strongholds 
in the wood  in the hill of hachilah  
which is on the south of jeshimon  
20now therefore  o king  come down  
according to all the desire of thy soul 
to come down  and our part shall be to 
deliver him up into the king s hand  
21and saul said  blessed be ye of the 
lord for ye have had compassion on 
me 22go i pray you  make yet more first samuel  
418 
 sure and know and see his place 
where his haunt is  and who hath seen 
him there  for it is told me that he 
dealeth very subtly  23see therefore  
and take knowledge of all the lurking 
places where he hideth himself  and 
come ye back to me with the certainty  
and i will go with you  and it shall 
come to pass  if he be in the land  that 
i will search him out among all the 
thousands of judah  24and they arose  
and went to ziph before saul  but 
david and his men were in the 
wilderness of maon  in the arabah on 
the south of jeshimon  25and saul and 
his men went to seek him  and they 
told david  wherefore he came down 
to the rock  and a bode in the 
wilderness of maon  and when saul 
heard that  he pursued after david in 
the wilderness of maon  26and saul 
went on this side of the mountain  and 
david and his men on that side of the 
mountain  and david made haste to get 
away for fear of saul  for saul and his 
men compassed david and his men 
round about to take them  27but there 
came a messenger unto saul  saying  
haste thee  and come  for the 
philistines have made a raid upon the 
land 28so saul returned from 
pursuing after david  and went a gainst 
the philistines  therefore they called  
that place asela
hammahlekoth  1and david 
went up from thence  and dwelt in the 
strongholds of en gedi  
                                                      
a that is the rock of divisions  2and it came to pass  when saul was 
returned from following the 
philistines  that it was told him  
saying behold  david is in the 
wilderness of en gedi 3then saul 
took three thousand chosen men out of 
all israel  and went to seek david and 
his men upon the rocks of the wild 
goats  4and he came to the sheepcotes 
by the way  where was a cave  and 
saul w ent in to cover his feet  now 
david and his men were sitting in the 
innermost parts of the cave  5and the 
men of david said unto him  behold 
the day in which the lord hath said 
unto thee  behold  i will deliver thine 
enemy into thy hand  and thou shalt do  
to him as it shall seem good unto thee  
then david arose  and cut off the skirt 
of saul s robe privily  6and it came to 
pass afterward  that david s heart 
smote him  because he had cut off 
sauls skirt  7and he said unto his 
men the lord forbid it me  that i 
should do this thing unto my lord  the 
lords anointed  to put forth my hand 
against him  seeing he is the l ords 
anointed  8so david checked his men 
with these words  and suffered them 
not to rise against saul  and saul rose 
up out of the cave  and went on his 
way  
9david also arose afterward  and 
went out of the cave  and cried after 
saul saying  my lord the king  and 
when saul looked behind him  david 
bowed with his face to the earth  and 
prostrated himself  10and david said to 
saul wherefo re hearkenest thou to 24 first samuel  
419 
 mens words  saying  behold  david 
seeketh thy hurt  11behold  this day 
thine eyes have seen how that the lord 
had delivered thee to day into my hand 
in the cave  and some bade me kill 
thee but mine eye spared thee  and i 
said i wil l not put forth my hand 
against my lord  for he is the l ords 
anointed  12moreover  my father  see 
yea see the skirt of thy robe in my 
hand  for in that i cut off the skirt of 
thy robe  and killed thee not  know 
thou and see that there is neither evil 
nor transgression in my hand  and i 
have not sinned against thee  though 
thou layest wait for my soul to take it  
13the lord judge between me and 
thee and the lord avenge me of thee  
but my hand shall not be upon thee  
14as saith the proverb of the ancients  
out of the wicked cometh forth 
wickedness  but my hand shall not be 
upon thee  15after whom is the king of 
israel come out  after whom dost thou 
pursue  after a dead dog  after a flea  
16the lord therefore be judge  and 
give sentence between me and thee  
and see  and plead my cause  and 
deliver me out of thy hand   
17and it came to pass  when david 
had made an end of speaking these 
words unto saul  that saul said  is this 
thy voice  my son david  and saul 
lifted up his voice  and wept  18and he 
said to  david  thou art more 
righteous than i  for thou hast rendered 
unto me good  whereas i have 
rendered unto thee evil  19and thou 
hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me  forasmuch as 
when the lord had delivered me up 
into thy hand  thou didst not kill me  
20for if a man find his enemy  will he 
let him go well away  wherefore the 
lord reward thee good for that which 
thou hast done unto me this day  21and 
now behold  i know that thou shalt 
surely be king  and that the kingdom 
of israel s hall be established in thy 
hand  22swear now therefore unto me 
by the lord that thou wilt not cut off 
my seed after me  and that thou wilt 
not destroy my name out of my 
father s house  23and david swore 
unto saul  and saul went home  but 
david and his me n got them up unto 
the stronghold   
and samuel died  and all 
israel gathered themselves 
together  and lamented him  and buried 
him in his house at ramah  and david 
arose  and went down to the 
wilderness of paran   
2and there was a man in maon  
whose pos sessions were in carmel  
and the man was very great  and he 
had three thousand sheep  and a 
thousand goats  and he was shearing 
his sheep in carmel  3now the name of 
the man was nabal  and the name of 
his wife abigail  and the woman was 
of good understandi ng and of a 
beautiful form  but the man was 
churlish and evil in his doings  and he 
was of the house of caleb  4and david 
heard in the wilderness that nabal was 
shearing his sheep  5and david sent 
ten young men  and david said unto 25 first samuel  
420 
 the young men  get you  up to 
carmel  and go to nabal  and greet 
him in my name  6and thus ye shall 
say all hail  and peace be both unto 
thee and peace be to thy house  and 
peace be unto all that thou hast  7and 
now i have heard that thou hast 
shearers  thy shepherds have now been 
with us  and we did them no hurt  
neither was there aught missing unto 
them  all the while they were in 
carmel  8ask thy young men  and they 
will tell thee  wherefore let the young 
men find favour in thine eyes  for we 
come on a good day  give i pray  thee 
whatsoever cometh to thy hand  unto 
thy servants  and to thy son david   
9and when david s young men 
came  they spoke to nabal according 
to all those words in the name of 
david  and ceased  10and nabal 
answered david s servants  and said  
who is d avid and who is the son of 
jesse  there are many servants now a
days that break away every man from 
his master  11shall i then take my 
bread  and my water  and my flesh that 
i have killed for my shearers  and give 
it unto men of whom i know not 
whence the y are  12so david s young 
men turned on their way  and went 
back  and came and told him according 
to all these words  13and david said 
unto his men  gird ye on every man 
his sword  and they girded on every 
man his sword  and david also girded 
on his swo rd and there went up after 
david about four hundred men  and 
two hundred abode by the baggage   14but one of the young men told 
abigail  nabal s wife  saying  
behold  david sent messengers out of 
the wilderness to salute our master  
and he flew upon them  15but the men 
were very good unto us  and we were 
not hurt  neither missed we any thing  
as long as we went with them  when 
we were in the fields  16they were a 
wall unto us both by night and by day  
all the while we were with them 
keeping the sheep  17now therefore 
know and consider what thou wilt do  
for evil is determined against our 
master  and against all his house  for 
he is such a base fellow  that one 
cannot speak to him   
18then abigail made haste  and took 
two hundred loaves  and two bottles of  
wine  and five sheep ready dressed  
and five measures of parched corn  and 
a hundred clusters of raisins  and two 
hundred cakes of figs  and laid them 
on asses  19and she said unto her 
young men  go on before me  behold  
i come after you  but she told n ot her 
husband nabal  20and it was so  as she 
rode on her ass  and came down by the 
covert of the mountain  that behold  
david and his men came down 
towards her  and she met them  
21now david had said  surely in vain 
have i kept all that this fellow hat h in 
the wilderness  so that nothing was 
missed of all that pertained unto him  
and he hath returned me evil for good  
22god do so unto the enemies of 
david  and more also  if i leave of all 
that pertain to him by the morning first samuel  
421 
 light so much as one male  23and 
when abigail saw david  she made 
haste  and alighted from her ass  and 
fell before david on her face  and 
bowed down to the ground  24and she 
fell at his feet  and said  upon me  my 
lord upon me be the iniquity  and let 
thy handmaid  i pray thee  speak in 
thine ears  and hear thou the words of 
thy handmaid  25let not my lord  i 
pray thee  regard this base fellow  even 
nabal  for as his name is  so is he  
anabal is his name  and churlishness is 
with him  but i thy handmaid saw not 
the young men of my lord whom thou 
didst send  26now therefore  my lord  
as the lord liveth  and as thy soul 
liveth  seeing the lord hath 
withholden thee from bloodguiltiness  
and from finding redress for thyself 
with thine own hand  now therefore let 
thine enemies  and them  that seek evil 
to my lord  be as nabal  27and now 
this present which thy servant hath 
brought unto my lord  let it be given 
unto the young men that follow my 
lord 28forgive  i pray thee  the 
trespass of thy handmaid  for the lord 
will certainly make my lord a sure 
house  because my lord fighteth the 
battles of the lord and evil is not 
found in thee all thy days  29and 
though man be risen up to pursue thee  
and to seek thy soul  yet the soul of my 
lord shall be bound in the bundle of 
life with the lord thy god  and the 
souls of thine enemies  them shall he 
                                                      
a that is churl  sling out  as from the hollow of a 
sling  30and it shall come to pass  
when the lord shall have done to my 
lord according to all the good that he 
hath spoken concerning thee  and shall 
have appointed the e prince over israel  
31that this shall be no stumbling block 
unto thee  nor offence of heart unto my 
lord either that thou hast shed blood 
without cause  or that my lord hath 
found redress for himself  and when 
the lord shall have dealt well with my 
lord then remember thy handmaid   
32and david said to babigail  
blessed be the lord the god of 
israel  who sent thee this day to meet 
me 33and blessed be thy discretion  
and blessed be thou  that hast kept me 
this day from bloodguiltiness  and 
from findin g redress for myself with 
mine own hand  34for in very deed  as 
the lord the god of israel  liveth  
who hath withholden me from hurting 
thee except thou hadst made haste and 
come to meet me  surely there had not 
been left unto nabal by the morning 
light so much as one male  35so david 
received of her hand that which she 
had brought him  and he said unto her  
go up in peace to thy house  see i 
have hearkened to thy voice  and have 
accepted thy person   
36and abigail came to nabal  and 
behold  he held a feast in his house  
like the feast of a king  and nabal s 
heart was merry within him  for he 
was very drunken  wherefore she told 
                                                      
b heb abigal  first samuel  
422 
 him nothing  less or more  until the 
morning light  37and it came to pass in 
the morning  when the wine was gone 
out of naba l that his wife told him 
these things  and his heart died within 
him and he became as a stone  38and 
it came to pass about ten days after  
that the lord smote nabal  so that he 
died  
39and when david heard that nabal 
was dead  he said  blessed be the 
lord that hath pleaded the cause of 
my reproach from the hand of nabal  
and hath kept back his servant from 
evil and the evil doing of nabal hath 
the lord returned upon his own head  
and david sent and spoke concerning 
abigail  to take her to him to wife  
40and when the servants of david 
were come to abigail to carmel  they 
spoke unto her  saying  david hath 
sent us unto thee  to take thee to him to 
wife 41and she arose  and bowed 
down with her face to the earth  and 
said behold  thy handmaid is a 
servant to wash the feet of the servants 
of my lord  42and abigail hastened  
and arose  and rode upon an ass  with 
five damsels of hers that followed her  
and she went after the messengers of 
david  and became his wife   
43david also took ahinoam of 
jezreel  and they became both of them 
his wives  44now saul had given 
michal his daughter  david s wife  to 
palti the son of laish  who was of 
gallim   
and the ziphites came unto 
saul to gibeah  saying  doth not david hide himself in the hill of 
hachilah  which is before jeshimon  
2then saul arose  and went down to 
the wilderness of ziph  having three 
thousand chosen men of israel with 
him to seek david in the wilderness of 
ziph  3and saul pitched in the hill of 
hachilah  which is before jeshimon  
by the way  but david abode in the 
wilderness  and he saw that saul came 
after him into the wilderness  4david 
therefore sent out spies  and 
understood that saul was come of a 
certainty  5and david arose  and came 
to the place where saul had pitched  
and david behel d the place where saul 
lay and abner the son of ner  the 
captain of his host  and saul lay within 
the barricade  and the people pitched 
round about him   
6then answered david and said to 
ahimelech the hittite  and to abishai 
the son of zeruiah  brother to  joab 
saying  who will go down with me to 
saul to the camp  and abishai said  
i will go down with thee  7so david 
and abishai came to the people by 
night  and behold  saul lay sleeping 
within the barricade  with his spear 
stuck in the ground at his h ead and 
abner and the people lay round about 
him 8then said abishai to david  
god hath delivered up thine enemy 
into thy hand this day  now therefore 
let me smite him  i pray thee  with the 
spear to the earth at one stroke  and i 
will not smite him the second time  
9and david said to abishai  destroy 
him not  for who can put forth his 26 first samuel  
423 
 hand against the l ords anointed  and 
be guiltless  10and david said  as 
the lord liveth  nay but the lord shall 
smite him  or his day shall come to 
die or he shall g o down into battle  
and be swept away  11the lord forbid 
it me  that i should put forth my hand 
against the l ords anointed  but now 
take i pray thee  the spear that is at his 
head  and the cruse of water and let us 
go 12so david took the spear and the 
cruse of water from saul s head  and 
they got them away  and no man saw 
it nor knew it  neither did any awake  
for they were all asleep  because a 
deep sleep from the lord was fallen 
upon them   
13then david went over to the other 
side and stood on the t op of the 
mountain afar off  a great space being 
between them  14and david cried to 
the people  and to abner the son of 
ner saying  answerest thou not  
abner  then abner answered and 
said who art thou that criest to the 
king 15and david said to abne r art 
not thou a valiant man  and who is 
like to thee in israel  wherefore then 
hast thou not kept watch over thy lord 
the king  for there came one of the 
people in to destroy the king thy lord  
16this thing is not good that thou hast 
done  as the lord liveth  ye deserve to 
die because ye have not kept watch 
over your lord  the l ords anointed  
and now  see where the king s spear 
is and the cruse of water that was at 
his head   17and saul knew david s voice  and 
said is this thy voice  my son 
david  and david said  it is my 
voice  my lord  o king  18and he said  
wherefore doth my lord pursue after 
his servant  for what have i done  or 
what evil is in my hand  19now 
therefore  i pray thee  let my lord the 
king hear the words of his servant  if it 
be the lord that hath stirred thee up 
against me  let him accept an offering  
but if it be the children of men  cursed 
be they before the lord for they have 
driven me out this day that i should 
not cleave unto the inheritance of the 
lord saying  go serve other gods  
20now therefore  let not my blood fall 
to the earth away from the presence of 
the lord for the king of israel is come 
out to seek a single flea  as when one 
doth hunt a partridge in the 
mountains   
21then said saul  i have sinned  
return  my son david  for i will no 
more do thee harm  because my life 
was precious in thine eyes this day  
behold  i have played the fool and 
erred exceedingly  22and david 
answered and said  behold the king s 
spear  let then one of the young men 
come over and fetch it  23and the lord 
will render to every man his 
righteousness and his faithfulness  
forasmuch as the lord delivered thee 
into my hand to day and i would not 
put forth my hand against the l ords 
anointed  24and behold  as thy life 
was much set by th is day in mine eyes  
so let my life be much set by in the first samuel  
424 
 eyes of the lord and let him deliver 
me out of all tribulation  25then saul 
said to david  blessed be thou  my 
son david  thou shalt both do mightily  
and shalt surely prevail  so david 
went his  way and saul returned to his 
place   
and david said in his heart  i 
shall now be swept away one 
day by the hand of saul  there is 
nothing better for me than that i should 
escape into the land of the philistines  
and saul will despair of me  to seek 
me any more in all the borders of 
israel  so shall i escape out of his 
hand  2and david arose  and passed 
over he and the six hundred men that 
were with him  unto achish the son of 
maoch  king of gath  3and david 
dwelt with achish at gath  he and his 
men every man with his household  
even david with his two wives  
ahinoam the jezreelitess  and abigail 
the carmelitess  nabal s wife  4and it 
was told saul that david was fled to 
gath  and he sought no more again for 
him  
5and david said unto achish  if 
now i have found favour in thine eyes  
let them give me a place in one of the 
cities in the country  that i may dwell 
there  for why should thy servant 
dwell in the royal city with thee  
6then achish gave him ziklag that 
day wherefore ziklag belongeth unto 
the kings of judah unto this day   
7and the number of the days that 
david dwelt in the country of the 
philistines was a full year and four months  8and david and his men went 
up and made a raid upon the 
geshurites  and the gizrites  and the 
amalekites  for those were the 
inhabitants of the land  who were of 
old as thou goest to shur  even unto 
the land of egypt  9and david smote 
the land  and left neither man nor 
woman alive  and took away the 
sheep  and the oxen  and the asses  and 
the camels  and the ap parel  and he 
returned  and came to achish  10and 
achish said  whither have ye made a 
raid to day and david said  against 
the south of judah  and against the 
south of the jerahmeelites  and against 
the south of the kenites  11and david 
left neither ma n nor woman alive  to 
bring them to gath  saying  lest they 
should tell on us  saying  so did 
david  and so hath been his manner all 
the while he hath dwelt in the country 
of the philistines  12and achish 
believed david  saying  he hath made 
his people israel utterly to abhor him  
therefore he shall be my servant for 
ever  
and it came to pass in those 
days that the philistines 
gathered their hosts together for 
warfare  to fight with israel  and 
achish said unto david  know thou 
assuredly  that tho u shalt go out with 
me in the host  thou and thy men  
2and david said to achish  therefore 
thou shalt know what thy servant will 
do and achish said to david  
therefore will i make thee keeper of 
my head for ever   27 
28 first samuel  
425 
 3now samuel was dead  and all 
israel  had lamented him  and buried 
him in ramah  even in his own city  
and saul had put away those that 
divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit 
out of the land  4and the philistines 
gathered themselves together  and 
came and pitched in shunem  and saul 
gathered  all israel together  and they 
pitched in gilboa  5and when saul 
saw the host of the philistines  he was 
afraid  and his heart trembled greatly  
6and when saul inquired of the lord 
the lord answered him not  neither by 
dreams  nor by urim  nor by prophets  
7then said saul unto his servants  
seek me a woman that divineth by a 
ghost  that i may go to her  and inquire 
of her  and his servants said to him  
behold  there is a woman that 
divineth by a ghost at en dor  
8and saul disguised himself  and 
put on  other raiment  and went  he and 
two men with him  and they came to 
the woman by night  and he said  
divine unto me  i pray thee  by a 
ghost  and bring me up whomsoever i 
shall name unto thee  9and the 
woman said unto him  behold  thou 
knowest what saul  hath done  how he 
hath cut off those that divine by a 
ghost or a familiar spirit out of the 
land wherefore then layest thou a 
snare for my life  to cause me to die  
10and saul swore to her by the lord 
saying  as the lord liveth  there shall 
no punishm ent happen to thee for this 
thing  11then said the woman  whom 
shall i bring up unto thee  and he said bring me up samuel  12and 
when the woman saw samuel  she 
cried with a loud voice  and the 
woman spoke to saul  saying  why 
hast thou deceived me  for thou art 
saul 13and the king said unto her  
be not afraid  for what seest thou  
and the woman said unto saul  i see 
a godlike being coming up out of the 
earth  14and he said unto her  what 
form is he of  and she said  an old 
man cometh up  and he is covered with 
a robe  and saul perceived that it was 
samuel  and he bowed with his face to 
the ground  and prostrated himself   
15and samuel said to saul  why 
hast thou disquieted me  to bring me 
up and saul answered  i am sore 
distressed  for the philistines make war 
against me  and god is departed from 
me and answereth me no more  
neither by prophets  nor by dreams  
therefore i have called thee  that thou 
mayest make known unto me what i 
shall do  16and samuel said  
wherefore then dost thou ask of me  
seeing the lord is departed from thee  
and is become thine adversary  17and 
the lord hath wrought for himself  as 
he spoke by me  and the lord hath 
rent the kingdom out of thy hand  and 
given it to thy neighbour  even to 
david  18because thou di dst not 
hearken to the voice of the lord and 
didst not execute his fierce wrath 
upon amalek  therefore hath the lord 
done this thing unto thee this day  
19moreover the lord will deliver israel 
also with thee into the hand of the first samuel  
426 
 philistines  and to morrow  shalt thou 
and thy sons be with me  the lord will 
deliver the host of israel also into the 
hand of the philistines   
20then saul fell straightway his full 
length upon the earth  and was sore 
afraid  because of the words of 
samuel  and there was no streng th in 
him for he had eaten no bread all the 
day nor all the night  21and the 
woman came unto saul  and saw that 
he was sore affrighted  and said unto 
him behold  thy handmaid hath 
hearkened unto thy voice  and i have 
put my life in my hand  and have 
hearkened unto thy words which thou 
spokest unto me  22now therefore  i 
pray thee  hearken thou also unto the 
voice of thy handmaid  and let me set a 
morsel of bread before thee  and eat  
that thou mayest have strength  when 
thou goest on thy way  23but he 
refused  and said  i will not eat  but 
his servants  together with the woman  
urged him  and he hearkened unto 
their voice  so he arose from the earth  
and sat upon the bed  24and the 
woman had a fatted calf in the house  
and she made haste  and killed i t and 
she took flour  and kneaded it  and did 
bake unleavened bread thereof  25and 
she brought it before saul  and before 
his servants  and they did eat  then 
they rose up  and went away that night   
now the philistines gathered 
together all their host s to 
aphek  and the israelites pitched by 
the fountain which is in jezreel  2and 
the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds  and by thousands  and 
david and his men passed on in the 
rearward with achish  3then said the 
princes of the philistines  what do 
these hebrews here  and achish said 
unto the princes of the philistines  is 
not this david  the servant of saul the 
king of israel  who hath been with me 
these days or these years  and i have 
found no fault in him since he fell 
away unto me unto this day  4but the 
princes of the philistines were wroth 
with him  and the princes of the 
philistines said unto him  make the 
man return  that he may go back to his 
place where thou hast appointed him  
and let him not go down with us to 
battle  lest in t he battle he become an 
adversary to us  for wherewith should 
this fellow reconcile himself unto his 
lord should it not be with the heads of 
these men  5is not this david  of 
whom they sang one to another in 
dances  saying   
saul hath slain his thousands   
and david his ten thousands   
6then achish called david  and said 
unto him  as the lord liveth  thou 
hast been upright  and thy going out 
and thy coming in with me in the host 
is good in my sight  for i have not 
found evil in thee since the day of thy 
coming unto me unto this day  
nevertheless the lords favour thee not  
7wherefore now return  and go in 
peace  that thou displease not the lords 
of the philistines  8and david said 
unto achish  but what have i done  
and what hast thou found in thy 29 first samuel  
427 
 servant so long as i have been before 
thee unto this day  that i may not go 
and fight against the enemies of my 
lord the king  9and achish answered 
and said to david  i know that thou 
art good in my sight  as an angel of 
god notwithstanding the princes of 
the p hilistines have said  he shall not 
go up with us to the battle  
10wherefore now rise up early in the 
morning with the servants of thy lord 
that are come with thee  and as soon as 
ye are up early in the morning  and 
have light  depart  11so david rose up 
early he and his men  to depart in the 
morning  to return into the land of the 
philistines  and the philistines went 
up to jezreel   
and it came to pass  when 
david and his men were come 
to ziklag on the third day  that the 
amalekites had made a raid up on the 
south  and upon ziklag  and had 
smitten ziklag  and burned it with fire  
2and had taken captive the women and 
all that were therein  both small and 
great  they slew not any  but carried 
them off  and went their way  3and 
when david and his men came to the 
city behold  it was burned with fire  
and their wives  and their sons  and 
their daughters  were taken captives  
4then david and the people that were 
with him lifted up their voice and 
wept  until they had no more power to 
weep  5and david s two wi ves were 
taken captives  ahinoam the 
jezreelitess  and abigail the wife of 
nabal the carmelite  6and david was greatly distressed  for the people spoke 
of stoning him  because the soul of all 
the people was grieved  every man for 
his sons and for his daugh ters but 
david strengthened himself in the 
lord his god   
7and david said to abiathar the 
priest  the son of ahimelech  i pray 
thee bring me hither the ephod  and 
abiathar brought thither the ephod to 
david  8and david inquired of the 
lord saying  shall i pursue after this 
troop  shall i overtake them  and he 
answered him  pursue  for thou shalt 
surely overtake them  and shalt 
without fail recover all  9so david 
went  he and the six hundred men that 
were with him  and came to the brook 
besor  where  those that were left 
behind stayed  10but david pursued  he 
and four hundred men  for two 
hundred stayed behind  who were so 
faint that they could not go over the 
brook besor   
11and they found an egyptian in the 
field and brought him to david  and 
gave him bread  and he did eat  and 
they gave him water to drink  12and 
they gave him a piece of a cake of figs  
and two clusters of raisins  and when 
he had eaten  his spirit came back to 
him for he had eaten no bread  nor 
drunk any water  three days and thre e 
nights  13and david said unto him  to 
whom belongest thou  and whence art 
thou and he said  i am a young 
egyptian  servant to an amalekite  and 
my master left me  because three days 
ago i fell sick  14we made a raid upon 30 first samuel  
428 
 the south of the cherethites  and upon 
that which belongeth to judah  and 
upon the south of caleb  and we 
burned ziklag with fire  15and david 
said to him  wilt thou bring me down 
to this troop  and he said  swear 
unto me by god  that thou wilt neither 
kill me  nor deliver me up i nto the 
hands of my master  and i will bring 
thee down to this troop   
16and when he had brought him 
down  behold  they were spread abroad 
over all the ground  eating and 
drinking  and feasting  because of all 
the great spoil that they had taken out 
of th e land of the philistines  and out 
of the land of judah  17and david 
smote them from the twilight even 
unto the evening of the next day  and 
there escaped not a man of them  save 
four hundred young men  who rode 
upon camels and fled  18and david 
recovered all that the amalekites had 
taken  and david rescued his two 
wives  19and there was nothing 
lacking to them  neither small nor 
great  neither sons nor daughters  
neither spoil  nor any thing that they 
had taken to them  david brought back 
all 20and david took all the flocks and 
the herds  which they drove before 
those other cattle  and said  this is 
david s spoil   
21and david came to the two 
hundred men  who were so faint that 
they could not follow david  whom 
also they had made to abide at the 
brook be sor and they went forth to 
meet david  and to meet the people that were with him  and when david 
came near to the people  he saluted 
them  22then answered all the wicked 
men and base fellows  of those that 
went with david  and said  because 
they went not  with us  we will not give 
them aught of the spoil that we have 
recovered  save to every man his wife 
and his children  that they may lead 
them away  and depart  23then said 
david  ye shall not do so  my 
brethren  with that which the lord 
hath given unto  us who hath preserved 
us and delivered the troop that came 
against us into our hand  24and who 
will hearken unto you in this matter  
for as is the share of him that goeth 
down to the battle  so shall be the 
share of him that tarrieth by the 
baggage  they shall share alike  25and 
it was so from that day forward  that 
he made it a statute and an ordinance 
for israel unto this day   
26and when david came to ziklag  
he sent of the spoil unto the elders of 
judah  even to his friends  saying  
behold a presen t for you of the spoil 
of the enemies of the lord 27to them 
that were in beth el and to them that 
were in ramoth of the south  and to 
them that were in jattir  28and to them 
that were in aroer  and to them that 
were in siphmoth  and to them that 
were in  eshtemoa  29and to them that 
were in racal  and to them that were in 
the cities of the jerahmeelites  and to 
them that were in the cities of the 
kenites  30and to them that were in 
hormah  and to them that were in bor first samuel  
429 
 ashan  and to them that were in 
athac h 31and to them that were in 
hebron  and to all the places where 
david himself and his men were wont 
to haunt   
now the philistines fought 
against israel  and the men of 
israel fled from before the philistines  
and fell down slain in mount gilboa  
2and the philistines followed hard 
upon saul and upon his sons  and the 
philistines slew jonathan  and 
abinadab  and malchishua  the sons of 
saul 3and the battle went sore against 
saul an the archers overtook him  and 
he was in great anguish by reason of 
the archers  4then said saul to his 
armour bearer  draw thy sword  and 
thrust me through therewith  lest these 
uncircumcised come and thrust me 
through  and make a mock of me  but 
his armour bearer would not  for he 
was sore afraid  therefore saul took 
his sword  and fell upon it  5and when 
his armour bearer saw that saul was 
dead  he likewise fell upon his sword  
and died with him  6so saul died  and 
his three sons  and his armour bearer  
and all his men  that same day 
together  7and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the 
valley  and they that were beyond the 
jordan  saw that the men of israel fled  
and that saul and his sons were dead  
they forsook the cities  and fled  and 
the philistines came and dwelt in them   
8and it came to pass on the morrow  
when the philistines came to strip the 
slain  that they found saul and his 
three sons fallen in mount gilboa  
9and they cut off his head  and 
stripped off his armour  and sent into 
the land of the philistines round about  
to carry the tidings u nto the house of 
their idols  and to the people  10and 
they put his armour in the house of the 
ashtaroth  and they fastened his body 
to the wall of beth shan 11and when 
the inhabitants of jabesh gilead heard 
concerning him that which the 
philistines had d one to saul  12all the 
valiant men arose  and went all night  
and took the body of saul and the 
bodies of his sons from the wall of 
beth shan and they came to jabesh  
and burnt them there  13and they took 
their bones  and buried them under the 
tamarisk tree in jabesh  and fasted 
seven days   31

second samuel  
 
and it came to pass after the 
death of saul  when david was 
returned from the slaughter of the 
amalekites  and david had abode two 
days in ziklag  2it came even to pass 
on the third day  that behold  a man 
came out of the camp fr om saul with 
his clothes rent  and earth upon his 
head  and so it was  when he came to 
david  that he fell to the earth  and 
prostrated himself  3and david said 
unto him  from whence comest 
thou and he said unto him  out of 
the camp of israel am i esca ped 4and 
david said unto him  how went the 
matter  i pray thee  tell me  and he 
answered  the people are fled from 
the battle  and many of the people also 
are fallen and dead  and saul and 
jonathan his son are dead also  5and 
david said unto the youn g man that 
told him  how knowest thou that saul 
and jonathan his son are dead  6and 
the young man that told him said  as 
i happened by chance upon mount 
gilboa  behold  saul leaned upon his 
spear  and lo the chariots and the 
horsemen pressed hard upon  him 
7and when he looked behind him  he 
saw me  and called unto me  and i 
answered  here am i  8and he said 
unto me  who art thou  and i 
answered him  i am an amalekite  
9and he said unto me  stand  i pray thee beside me  and slay me  for the 
agony hath taken hold of me  because 
my life is just yet in me  10so i stood 
beside him  and slew him  because i 
was sure that he could not live after 
that he was fallen  and i took the 
crown that was upon his head  and the 
bracelet that was on his arm  and have 
brought them hither unto my lord   
11then david took hold on his 
clothes  and rent them  and likewise all 
the men that were with him  12and 
they wailed  and wept  and fasted until 
even  for saul  and for jonathan his 
son and for the people of the lord 
and f or the house of israel  because 
they were fallen by the sword  13and 
david said unto the young man that 
told him  whence art thou  and he 
answered  i am the son of an 
amalekite stranger  14and david said 
unto him  how wast thou not afraid to 
put forth  thy hand to destroy the 
lords anointed  15and david called 
one of the young men  and said  go 
near and fall upon him  and he smote 
him that he died  16and david said 
unto him  thy blood be upon thy 
head  for thy mouth hath testified 
against thee  saying i have slain the 
lords anointed   
17and david lamented with this 
lamentation over saul and over 
jonathan his son  18and said to teach 1 second samuel  
431 
 the sons of judah the bow  behold  it 
is written in the book of jashar   
19thy beauty  o israel  upon thy 
high pla ces is slain   
how are the mighty fallen   
 
20tell it not in gath   
publish it not in the streets of 
ashkelon   
lest the daughters of the philistines  
 rejoice   
lest the daughters of the 
uncircumcised triumph   
21ye mountains of gilboa   
let there be no d ew nor rain upon 
you  
neither fields of choice fruits   
for there the shield of the mighty 
was vilely cast away   
the shield of saul  not anointed 
with oil   
22from the blood of the slain  from 
the fat of the mighty   
the bow of jonathan turned not 
back   
and the sword of saul returned not 
empty   
23saul and jonathan  the lovely and 
the pleasant  
in their lives  even in their death 
they were not divided   
they were swifter than eagles   
they were stronger than lions   
24ye daughters of israel  weep over 
saul  
who clothed you in scarlet  with 
other delights   
who put ornaments of gold upon 
your apparel   25how are the mighty fallen in the 
midst of the battle   
 
jonathan upon thy high places is 
slain   
26i am distressed for thee  my 
brother jonathan   
very p leasant hast thou been unto 
me  
wonderful was thy love to me   
passing the love of women   
27how are the mighty fallen   
and the weapons of war perished   
 
and it came to pass after this  that 
david inquired of the lord 
saying  shall i go up into any of the 
cities of judah  and the lord said 
unto him  go up  and david said  
whither shall i go up  and he said  
unto hebron  2so david went up 
thither  and his two wives also  
ahinoam the jezreelitess  and abigail 
the wife of nabal the carmelite  3and 
his men that were with him did david 
bring up  every man with his 
household  and they dwelt in the cities 
of hebron  4and the men of judah 
came  and they there anointed david 
king over the house of judah   
and they told david  saying  the 
men of jabesh gilead were they that 
buried saul  5and david sent 
messengers unto the men of jabesh 
gilead  and said unto them  blessed be 
ye of the lord that ye have shown this 
kindness unto your lord  even unto 
saul and have buried him  6and now 
the lord show kindn ess and truth unto 2 second samuel  
432 
 you and i also will requite you this 
kindness  because ye have done this 
thing  7now therefore let your hands 
be strong  and be ye valiant  for saul 
your lord is dead  and also the house of 
judah have anointed me king over 
them   
8now abner the son of ner  captain 
of saul s host  had taken ish bosheth 
the son of saul  and brought him over 
to mahanaim  9and he made him king 
over gilead  and over the ashurites  
and over jezreel  and over ephraim  
and over benjamin  and over all israel  
10ishbosheth saul s son was forty 
years old when he began to reign over 
israel  and he reigned two years  but 
the house of judah followed david  
11and the time that david was king in 
hebron over the house of judah was 
seven years and six months   
12and abne r the son of ner  and the 
servants of ish bosheth the son of 
saul went out from mahanaim to 
gibeon  13and joab the son of zeruiah  
and the servants of david  went out  
and they met together by the pool of 
gibeon  and sat down  the one on the 
one side of t he pool  and the other on 
the other side of the pool  14and abner 
said to joab  let the young men  i 
pray thee  arise and play before us  
and joab said  let them arise  
15then they arose and passed over by 
number  twelve for benjamin  and for 
ishboshe th the son of saul  and 
twelve of the servants of david  16and 
they caught every one his fellow by 
the head  and thrust his sword in his fellow s side  so they fell down 
together  wherefore that place was 
called ahelkath hazzurim  which is in 
gibeon  17and the battle was very sore 
that day  and abner was beaten  and 
the men of israel  before the servants 
of david   
18and the three sons of zeruiah 
were there  joab and abishai  and 
asahel  and asahel was as light of foot 
as one of the roes that are in the fi eld 
19and asahel pursued after abner  and 
in going he turned not to the right hand 
nor to the left from following abner  
20then abner looked behind him  and 
said is it thou  asahel  and he 
answered  it is i  21and abner said to 
him turn thee aside to thy right hand 
or to thy left  and lay thee hold on one 
of the young men  and take thee his 
armour  but asahel would not turn 
aside from following him  22and 
abner said again to asahel  turn thee 
aside from following me  wherefore 
should i smite thee to the ground  how 
then should i hold up my face to joab 
thy brother  23howbeit he refused to 
turn aside  wherefore abner with the 
hinder end of the spear smote him in 
the groin  that the spear came out 
behind him  and he fell down there  
and died in the same place  and it 
came to pass  that as many as came to 
the place where asahel fell down and 
died stood still   
                                                      
a that is the field of the sharp 
knives  second samuel  
433 
 24but joab and abishai pursued after 
abner  and the sun went down when 
they were come to the hill of ammah  
that lieth before giah by the way o f 
the wilderness of gibeon  25and the 
children of benjamin gathered 
themselves together after abner  and 
became one band  and stood on the top 
of a hill  26then abner called to joab  
and said  shall the sword devour for 
ever knowest thou not that it will  be 
bitterness in the end  how long shall it 
be then  ere thou bid the people return 
from following their brethren  27and 
joab said  as god liveth  if thou hadst 
not spoken  surely then only after the 
morning the people had gone away  
every one from foll owing his brother  
28so joab blew the horn  and all the 
people stood still  and pursued after 
israel no more  neither fought they any 
more  29and abner and his men went 
all that night through the arabah  and 
they passed over the jordan  and went 
through a ll bithron  and came to 
mahanaim   
30and joab returned from following 
abner  and when he had gathered all 
the people together  there lacked of 
david s servants nineteen men and 
asahel  31but the servants of david 
had smitten of benjamin  even of 
abner s me nthree hundred and 
threescore men died  32and they took 
up asahel  and buried him in the 
sepulchre of his father  which was in 
beth lehem  and joab and his men 
went all night  and the day broke upon 
them at hebron   now there was long war between 
the ho use of saul and the house of 
david  and david waxed stronger and 
stronger  but the house of saul waxed 
weaker and weaker   
2and unto david were sons born in 
hebron  and his first born was 
amnon  of ahinoam the jezreelitess  
3and his second  chileab  of abi gail 
the wife of nabal the carmelite  and 
the third  absalom the son of maacah 
the daughter of talmai king of geshur  
4and the fourth  adonijah the son of 
haggith  and the fifth  shephatiah the 
son of abital  5and the sixth  ithream  
of eglah david s wife  these were 
born to david in hebron   
6and it came to pass  while there 
was war between the house of saul 
and the house of david  that abner 
showed himself strong in the house of 
saul 7now saul had a concubine  
whose name was rizpah  the daughter 
of aiah  and ishbosheth  said to 
abner  wherefore hast thou gone in 
unto my father s concubine  8then 
was abner very wroth for the words of 
ishbosheth  and said  am i a dog s 
head that belongeth to judah  this day 
do i show kindness unto the house of 
saul th y father  to his brethren  and to 
his friends  and have not delivered thee 
into the hand of david  and yet thou 
chargest me this day with a fault 
concerning this woman  9god do so to 
abner  and more also  if as the lord 
hath sworn to david  i do not even so 
to him  10to transfer the kingdom from 
the house of saul  and to set up the 3 second samuel  
434 
 throne of david over israel and over 
judah  from dan even to beer sheba  
11and he could not answer abner 
another word  because he feared him   
12and abner sent messengers to 
david straightway  saying  whose is 
the land  saying also  make thy 
league with me  and behold  my hand 
shall be with thee  to bring over all 
israel unto thee  13and he said  well  
i will make a league with thee  but one 
thing i require of thee  that i s thou 
shalt not see my face  except thou first 
bring michal saul s daughter  when 
thou comest to see my face  14and 
david sent messengers to ish bosheth 
sauls son  saying  deliver me my 
wife michal  whom i betrothed to me 
for a hundred foreskins of th e 
philistines  15and ish bosheth sent  
and took her from her husband  even 
from paltiel the son of laish  16and 
her husband went with her  weeping as 
he went  and followed her to bahurim  
then said abner unto him  go 
return  and he returned   
17and abn er had communication 
with the elders of israel  saying  in 
times past ye sought for david to be 
king over you  18now then do it  for the 
lord hath spoken of david  saying  by 
the hand of my servant david i will 
save my people israel out of the hand 
of the  philistines  and out of the hand 
of all their enemies  19and abner also 
spoke in the ears of benjamin  and 
abner went also to speak in the ears of 
david in hebron all that seemed good 
to israel  and to the whole house of benjamin  20so abner came to davi d 
to hebron  and twenty men with him  
and david made abner and the men 
that were with him a feast  21and 
abner said unto david  i will arise 
and go  and will gather all israel unto 
my lord the king  that they may make a 
covenant with thee  and that thou 
mayest reign over all that thy soul 
desireth  and david sent abner away  
and he went in peace   
22and behold  the servants of david 
and joab came from a foray  and 
brought in a great spoil with them  but 
abner was not with david in hebron  
for he had sent  him away  and he was 
gone in peace  23when joab and all the 
host that was with him were come  
they told joab  saying  abner the son 
of ner came to the king  and he hath 
sent him away  and he is gone in 
peace  24then joab came to the king  
and said  wha t hast thou done  
behold  abner came unto thee  why is 
it that thou hast sent him away  and he 
is quite gone  25thou knowest abner 
the son of ner  that he came to deceive 
thee and to know thy going out and 
thy coming in  and to know all that 
thou doest  26and when joab was 
come out from david  he sent 
messengers after abner  and they 
brought him back from bor sirah  but 
david knew it not   
27and when abner was returned to 
hebron  joab took him aside into the 
midst of the gate to speak with him 
quietly  and smote him there in the 
groin  that he died  for the blood of second samuel  
435 
 asahel his brother  28and afterward 
when david heard it  he said  i and 
my kingdom are guiltless before the 
lord for ever from the blood of abner 
the son of ner  29let it fall upon the 
head of  joab and upon all his father s 
house  and let there not fail from the 
house of joab one that hath an issue  or 
that is a leper  or that leaneth on a 
staff or that falleth by the sword  or 
that lacketh bread  30so joab and 
abishai his brother slew abner  
because he had killed their brother 
asahel at gibeon in the battle   
31and david said to joab  and to all 
the people that were with him  rend 
your clothes  and gird you with 
sackcloth  and wail before abner  
and king david followed the bier  
32and they  buried abner in hebron  
and the king lifted up his voice  and 
wept at the grave of abner  and all the 
people wept  33and the king lamented 
for abner  and said   
should abner die as a churl dieth  
34thy hands were not bound  nor thy 
feet put into fetters   
as a man falleth before the children 
of iniquity  so didst thou fall   
and all the people wept again over 
him 35and all the people came to 
cause david to eat bread while it was 
yet day  but david swore  saying  
god do so to me  and more also  if i 
taste bread  or aught else  till the sun 
be down  36and all the people took 
notice of it  and it pleased them  
whatsoever the king did  pleased all 
the people  37so all the people and all israel understood that day that it was 
not of the king to slay abner the son of 
ner 38and the king said unto his 
servants  know ye not that there is a 
prince and a great man fallen this day 
in israel  39and i am this day weak  
and just anointed king  and these men 
the sons of zeruiah are too hard for 
me the lord reward the e vildoer 
according to his wickedness   
 
and when saul s son heard that 
abner was dead in hebron  his 
hands became feeble  and all the 
israelites were affrighted  2and saul s 
son had two men that were captains of 
bands  the name of the one was 
baanah  and the name of the other 
rechab  the sons of rimmon the 
beerothite  of the children of 
benjamin  for beeroth also is reckoned 
to benjamin  3and the beerothites fled 
to gittaim  and have been sojourners 
there until this day   
4now jonathan  sauls son  had a 
son that was lame of his feet  he was 
five years old when the tidings came 
of saul and jonathan out of jezreel  
and his nurse took him up  and fled  
and it came to pass  as she made haste 
to flee  that he fell  and became lame  
and his name was mephiboshet h  
5and the sons of rimmon the 
beerothite  rechab and baanah  went  
and came about the heat of the day to 
the house of ish bosheth  as he took 
his rest at noon  6and they came 
thither into the midst of the house  as 
though they would have fetched 4 second samuel  
436 
 wheat  and they smote him in the 
groin  and rechab and baanah his 
brother escaped  7now when they 
came into the house  as he lay on his 
bed in his bed chamber  they smote 
him and slew him  and beheaded him  
and took his head  and went by the 
way of the arabah all  night  8and they 
brought the head of ish bosheth unto 
david to hebron  and said to the king  
behold the head of ish bosheth the 
son of saul thine enemy  who sought 
thy life  and the lord hath avenged my 
lord the king this day of saul  and of 
his seed  2009and david answered 
rechab and baanah his brother  the 
sons of rimmon the beerothite  and 
said unto them  as the lord liveth  
who hath redeemed my soul out of all 
adversity  10when one told me  saying  
behold  saul is dead  and he was in his 
own eyes as  though he brought good 
tidings  i took hold of him  and slew 
him in ziklag  instead of giving a 
reward for his tidings  11how much 
more  when wicked men have slain a 
righteous person in his own house 
upon his bed  shall i not now require 
his blood of your  hand  and take you 
away from the earth  12and david 
commanded his young men  and they 
slew them  and cut off their hands and 
their feet  and hanged them up beside 
the pool in hebron  but they took the 
head of ish bosheth  and buried it in 
the grave of ab ner in hebron   
then came all the tribes of israel 
to david unto hebron  and spoke  
saying  behold  we are thy bone and thy flesh  2in times past  when saul 
was king over us  it was thou that didst 
lead out and bring in israel  and the 
lord said to thee  thou shalt feed my 
people israel  and thou shalt be prince 
over israel  3so all the elders of israel 
came to the king to hebron  and king 
david made a covenant with them in 
hebron before the lord and they 
anointed david king over israel   
4david was th irty years old when he 
began to reign  and he reigned forty 
years  5in hebron he reigned over 
judah seven years and six months  and 
in jerusalem he reigned thirty and 
three years over all israel and judah   
6and the king and his men went to 
jerusalem again st the jebusites  the 
inhabitants of the land  who spoke 
unto david  saying  except thou take 
away the blind and the lame  thou shalt 
not come in hither  thinking  david 
cannot come in hither  7nevertheless 
david took the stronghold of zion  the 
same i s the city of david  8and david 
said on that day  whosoever smiteth 
the jebusites  and getteth up to the 
gutter  and taketh away  the lame and 
the blind  that are hated of david s 
soul wherefore they say  there 
are the blind and the lame  he cannot 
come into the house  9and david 
dwelt in the stronghold  and called it 
the city of david  and david built 
round about from millo and inward  
10and david waxed greater and 
greater  for the lord the god of hosts  
was with him   5 second samuel  
437 
 11and hiram king of tyre sent  
messengers to david  and cedar trees  
and carpenters  and masons  and they 
built david a house  12and david 
perceived that the lord had 
established him king over israel  and 
that he had exalted his kingdom for 
his people israel s sake   
13and david took h im more 
concubines and wives out of 
jerusalem  after he was come from 
hebron  and there were yet sons and 
daughters born to david  14and these 
are the names of those that were born 
unto him in jerusalem  shammua  and 
shobab  and nathan  and solomon  
15and ibhar  and elishua  and nepheg  
and japhia  16and elishama  and 
eliada  and eliphelet   
17and when the philistines heard 
that david was anointed king over 
israel  all the philistines went up to 
seek david  and david heard of it  and 
went down to the hold  18now the 
philistines had come and spread 
themselves in the valley of rephaim  
19and david inquired of the lord 
saying  shall i go up against the 
philistines  wilt thou deliver them 
into my hand  and the lord said unto 
david  go up  for i will certainl y 
deliver the philistines into thy hand  
20and david came to baal perazim  
and david smote them there  and he 
said the lord hath broken mine 
enemies before me  like the breach of 
waters  therefore the name of that place was called abaalperazim  21and 
they left their images there  and david 
and his men took them away   
22and the philistines came up yet 
again  and spread themselves in the 
valley of rephaim  23and when david 
inquired of the lord he said  thou 
shalt not go up  make a circuit behind 
them  and come upon them over 
against the mulberry trees  24and it 
shall be  when thou hearest the sound 
of marching in the tops of the 
mulberry trees  that then thou shalt 
bestir thyself  for then is the lord 
gone out before thee to smite the host 
of the phili stines  25and david did so  
as the lord commanded him  and 
smote the philistines from geba until 
thou come to gezer   
and david again gathered 
together all the chosen men of 
israel  thirty thousand  2and david 
arose  and went with all the people that 
were with him  from baale judah  to 
bring up from thence the ark of god  
whereupon is called the name  even 
the name of the lord of hosts that 
sitteth upon the cherubim  3and they 
set the ark of god upon a new cart  
and brought it out of the house of 
abinada b that was in the hill  and 
uzzah and ahio  the sons of 
abinadab  drove the new cart  4and 
they brought it out of the house of 
abinadab  which was in the hill  with 
the ark of god  and ahio went before 
the ark  5and david and all the house 
                                                      
a that is the possessor of breaches  6 second samuel  
438 
 of israel played  before the lord with 
all manner of instruments made of 
cypress wood  and with harps  and 
with psalteries  and with timbrels  and 
with sistra  and with cymbals   
6and when they came to the 
threshing floor of nacon  uzzah put 
forth his hand to the ark of go d and 
took hold of it  for the oxen stumbled  
7and the anger of the lord was 
kindled against uzzah  and god smote 
him there for his error  and there he 
died by the ark of god  8and david 
was displeased  because the lord had 
broken forth upon uzzah  and th at 
place was called aperez uzzah  unto 
this day 9and david was afraid of the 
lord that day  and he said  how shall 
the ark of the lord come unto me  
10so david would not remove the ark 
of the lord unto him into the city of 
david  but david carried it asi de into 
the house of obed edom the gittite  
11and the ark of the lord remained in 
the house of obed edom the gittite 
three months  and the lord blessed 
obed edom  and all his house   
12and it was told king david  
saying  the lord hath blessed the 
house of  obed edom  and all that 
pertaineth unto him  because of the ark 
of god  and david went and brought 
up the ark of god from the house of 
obed edom into the city of david with 
joy 13and it was so  that when they 
that bore the ark of the lord had gone 
six p aces he sacrificed an ox and a 
                                                      
a that is the breach of uzzah  fatling  14and david danced before the 
lord with all his might  and david 
was girded with a linen ephod  15so 
david and all the house of israel 
brought up the ark of the lord with 
shouting  and with the sound of the 
horn  
16and it was so  as the ark of the 
lord came into the city of david  that 
michal the daughter of saul looked out 
at the window  and saw king david 
leaping and dancing before the lord 
and she despised him in her heart  
17and they brought in the ark of the 
lord and set it in its place  in the 
midst of the tent that david had 
pitched for it  and david offered burnt 
offerings and peace offerings before 
the lord 18and when david had made 
an end of offering the burnt offering 
and the peace offerings  he blessed  the 
people in the name of the lord of 
hosts  19and he dealt among all the 
people  even among the whole 
multitude of israel  both to men and 
women  to every one a cake of bread  
and a cake made in a pan  and a sweet 
cake so all the people departed every 
one to his house   
20then david returned to bless his 
household  and michal the daughter 
of saul came out to meet david  and 
said how did the king of israel get 
him honour to day who uncovered 
himself to day in the eyes of the 
handmaids of his servants  as one of 
the vain fellows shamelessly 
uncovereth himself   21and david 
said unto michal  before the lord second samuel  
439 
 who chose me above thy father  and 
above all his house  to appoint me 
prince over the people of the lord 
over israel  before the lord will i 
make merry  22and i will be yet more 
vile than thus  and will be base in mine 
own sight  and with the handmaids 
whom thou hast spoken of  with them 
will i get me honour  23and michal 
the daughter of saul had no child unto 
the day of her death   
and it came t o pass  when the 
king dwelt in his house  and the 
lord had given him rest from all his 
enemies round about  2that the king 
said unto nathan the prophet  see 
now i dwell in a house of cedar  but 
the ark of god dwelleth within 
curtains  3and nathan said t o the 
king go do all that is in thy heart  
for the lord is with thee  4and it 
came to pass the same night  that the 
word of the lord came unto nathan  
saying  5go and tell my servant 
david  thus saith the lord shalt thou 
build me a house for me to dw ell in  
6for i have not dwelt in a house since 
the day that i brought up the children 
of israel out of egypt  even to this day  
but have walked in a tent and in a 
tabernacle  7in all places wherein i 
have walked among all the children of 
israel  spoke i a word with any of the 
tribes of israel  whom i commanded to 
feed my people israel  saying  why 
have ye not built me a house of cedar  
8now therefore thus shalt thou say 
unto my servant david  thus saith the 
lord of hosts  i took thee from the sheepcote  from following the sheep  
that thou shouldest be prince over my 
people  over israel  9and i have been 
with thee whithersoever thou didst go  
and have cut off all thine enemies from 
before thee  and i will make thee a 
great name  like unto the name of the 
great ones that are in the earth  10and i 
will appoint a place for my people 
israel  and will plant them  that they 
may dwell in their own place  and be 
disquieted no more  neither shall the 
children of wickedness afflict them 
any more  as at the first  11even  from 
the day that i commanded judges to be 
over my people israel  and i will cause 
thee to rest from all thine enemies  
moreover the lord telleth thee that the 
lord will make thee a house  12when 
thy days are fulfilled  and thou shalt 
sleep with thy fathe rs i will set up thy 
seed after thee  that shall proceed out 
of thy body  and i will establish his 
kingdom  13he shall build a house for 
my name  and i will establish the 
throne of his kingdom for ever  14i will 
be to him for a father  and he shall be 
to me for a son  if he commit iniquity  
i will chasten him with the rod of men  
and with the stripes of the children of 
men 15but my mercy shall not depart 
from him  as i took it from saul  
whom i put away before thee  16and 
thy house and thy kingdom shall b e 
made sure for ever before thee  thy 
throne shall be established for ever  
17according to all these words  and 
according to all this vision  so did 
nathan speak unto david   7 second samuel  
440 
 18then david the king went in  and 
sat before the lord and he said  who 
am i  o lord g od and what is my 
house  that thou hast brought me thus 
far 19and this was yet a small thing in 
thine eyes  o lord g od but thou hast 
spoken also of thy servant s house for 
a great while to come  and this too 
after the manner of great men  o lord  
god 20and what can david say more 
unto thee  for thou knowest thy 
servant  o lord g od 21for thy word s 
sake and according to thine own 
heart  hast thou wrought all this 
greatness  to make thy servant know 
it 22therefore thou art great  o lord 
god for there is none like thee  
neither is there any god beside thee  
according to all that we have heard 
with our ears  23and who is like thy 
people  like israel  a nation one in the 
earth  whom god went to redeem unto 
himself for a people  and to make him 
a name and to do for thy land great 
things and tremendous  even for you  
in driving out  from before thy 
people  whom thou didst redeem to 
thee out of egypt  the nations and 
their gods  24and thou didst establish 
to thyself thy people israel to be a 
people u nto thee for ever  and thou  
lord becamest their god  25and now  
o lord god the word that thou hast 
spoken concerning thy servant  and 
concerning his house  confirm thou it 
for ever  and do as thou hast spoken  
26and let thy name be magnified for 
ever that it may be said  the lord of 
hosts is god over israel  and the house of thy servant david shall be 
established before thee  27for thou  o 
lord of hosts  the god of israel  hast 
revealed to thy servant  saying  i will 
build thee a house  therefore hath t hy 
servant taken heart to pray this prayer 
unto thee  28and now  o lord g od 
thou alone art god  and thy words 
are truth  and thou hast promised this 
good thing unto thy servant  29now 
therefore let it please thee to bless the 
house of thy servant  that it  may 
continue for ever before thee  for 
thou  o lord g od hast spoken it  and 
through thy blessing let the house of 
thy servant be blessed for ever   
and after this it came to pass  that 
david smote the philistines  and 
subdued them  and david took 
meth egammah out of the hand of the 
philistines   
2and he smote moab  and measured 
them with the line  making them to lie 
down on the ground  and he measured 
two lines to put to death  and one full 
line to keep alive  and the moabites 
became servants to david  and brought 
presents  3david smote also hadadezer 
the son of rehob  king of zobah  as he 
went to establish his dominion at the 
river euphrates  4and david took from 
him a thousand and seven hundred 
horsemen  and twenty thousand 
footmen  and david houghed all the 
chariot horses  but reserved of them 
for a hundred chariots  5and when the 
arameans of damascus came to 
succour hadadezer king of zobah  
david smote of the arameans two and 8 second samuel  
441 
 twenty thousand men  6then david put 
garrisons in aram of damascus  and 
the arameans became servants to 
david  and brought presents  and the 
lord gave victory to david 
whithersoever he went  7and david 
took the shields of gold that were on 
the servants of hadadezer  and brought 
them to jerusalem  8and from betah 
and from berothai  cities of 
hadadezer  king david took exceeding 
much brass   
9and when toi king of hamath 
heard that david had smitten all the 
host of hadadezer  10then toi sent 
joram his son unto king david  to 
salute him  and to bless him because 
he had fought against hadadezer and 
smitten him  for hadadezer had wars 
with toi and he brought with him 
vessels of silver  and vessels of gold  
and vessels of brass  11these also did 
king david dedicate unto the lord 
with the silver and gold that he 
dedicated of all the natio ns which he 
subdued  12of aram  and of moab  and 
of the children of ammon  and of the 
philistines  and of amalek  and of the 
spoil of hadadezer  son of rehob  king 
of zobah  13and david got him a name 
when he returned from smiting the 
arameans in the valle y of salt  even 
eighteen thousand men  14and he put 
garrisons in edom  throughout all 
edom put he garrisons  and all the 
edomites became servants to david  
and the lord gave victory to david 
whithersoever he went   15and david reigned over all israel  
and david executed justice and 
righteousness unto all his people  
16and joab the son of zeruiah was 
over the host  and jehoshaphat the son 
of ahilud was recorder  17and zadok 
the son of ahitub  and ahimelech the 
son of abiathar  were priests  and 
seraiah was s cribe  18and benaiah the 
son of jehoiada was over the 
cherethites and the pelethites  and 
david s sons were chief ministers   
and david said  is there yet any 
that is left of the house of saul  
that i may show him kindness for 
jonathan s sake  2now the re was of 
the house of saul a servant whose 
name was ziba  and they called him 
unto david  and the king said unto 
him art thou ziba  and he said  
thy servant is he  3and the king said  
is there not yet any of the house of 
saul that i may show the ki ndness of 
god unto him  and ziba said unto 
the king  jonathan hath yet a son  who 
is lame on his feet  4and the king said 
unto him  where is he  and ziba 
said unto the king  behold  he is in 
the house of machir the son of 
ammiel  in lo debar  5then king 
david sent  and fetched him out of the 
house of machir the son of ammiel  
from lo debar  6and mephibosheth  
the son of jonathan  the son of saul  
came unto david  and fell on his face  
and prostrated himself  and david 
said mephibosheth   and he 
answered  behold thy servant   7and 
david said unto him  fear not  for i 9 second samuel  
442 
 will surely show thee kindness for 
jonathan thy father s sake  and will 
restore thee all the land of saul thy 
father  and thou shalt eat bread at my 
table continually  8and he bowed  
down  and said  what is thy servant  
that thou shouldest look upon such a 
dead dog as i am   
9then the king called to ziba  sauls 
servant  and said unto him  all that 
pertained to saul and to all his house 
have i given unto thy master s son  
10and tho u shalt till the land for him  
thou and thy sons  and thy servants  
and thou shalt bring in the fruits  that 
thy master s son may have bread to 
eat but mephibosheth thy master s 
son shall eat bread continually at my 
table  now ziba had fifteen sons and 
twenty servants  11then said ziba unto 
the king  according to all that my 
lord the king commandeth his servant  
so shall thy servant do  but 
mephibosheth eateth at my table as 
one of the king s sons  12now 
mephibosheth had a young son  whose 
name was mic a and all that dwelt in 
the house of ziba were servants unto 
mephibosheth  13but mephibosheth 
dwelt in jerusalem  for he did eat 
continually at the king s table  and he 
was lame on both his feet   
and it came to pass after this  
that the king of the ch ildren of 
ammon died  and hanun his son 
reigned in his stead  2and david said  
i will show kindness unto hanun the 
son of nahash  as his father showed 
kindness unto me  so david sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him 
concerning his father  and d avids 
servants came into the land of the 
children of ammon  3but the princes 
of the children of ammon said unto 
hanun their lord  thinkest thou that 
david doth honour thy father  that he 
hath sent comforters unto thee  hath 
not david sent his servants un to thee 
to search the city  and to spy it out  and 
to overthrow it  4so hanun took 
david s servants  and shaved off the 
one half of their beards  and cut off 
their garments in the middle  even to 
their buttocks  and sent them away  
5when they told it unto  david  he sent 
to meet them  for the men were greatly 
ashamed  and the king said  tarry at 
jericho until your beards be grown  
and then return   
6and when the children of ammon 
saw that they were become odious to 
david  the children of ammon sent 
and hi red the arameans of beth rehob  
and the arameans of zobah  twenty 
thousand footmen  and the king of 
maacah with a thousand men  and the 
men of tob twelve thousand men  
7and when david heard of it  he sent 
joab and all the host of the mighty 
men 8and the children of ammon 
came out  and put the battle in array at 
the entrance of the gate  and the 
arameans of zobah  and of rehob  
and the men of tob and maacah  were 
by themselves in the field   
9now when joab saw that the battle 
was set against him before and  behind  
he chose of all the choice men of 10 second samuel  
443 
 israel  and put them in array against 
the arameans  10and the rest of the 
people he committed into the hand of 
aabishai his brother  and he put them 
in array against the children of 
ammon  11and he said  if the 
arameans be too strong for me  then 
thou shalt help me  but if the children 
of ammon be too strong for thee  then 
i will come and help thee  12be of 
good courage  and let us prove strong 
for our people  and for the cities of our 
god and the lord do that wh ich 
seemeth him good  13so joab and the 
people that were with him drew nigh 
unto the battle against the arameans  
and they fled before him  14and when 
the children of ammon saw that the 
arameans were fled  they likewise fled 
before abishai  and entered in to the 
city then joab returned from the 
children of ammon  and came to 
jerusalem   
15and when the arameans saw that 
they were put to the worse before 
israel  they gathered themselves 
together  16and hadadezer sent  and 
brought out the arameans that were 
beyond the river  and they came to 
helam  with shobach the captain of 
the host of hadadezer at their head  
17and it was told david  and he 
gathered all israel together  and passed 
over the jordan  and came to helam  
and the arameans set themselves in 
array against david  and fought with 
him 18and the arameans fled before 
                                                      
a heb abshai  israel  and david slew of the 
arameans seven hundred drivers of 
chariots  and forty thousand horsemen  
and smote shobach the captain of their 
host so that he died there  19and when 
all the  kings that were servants to 
hadadezer saw that they were put to 
the worse before israel  they made 
peace with israel  and served them  so 
the arameans feared to help the 
children of ammon any more   
and it came to pass  at the 
return of the year  at th e time 
when kings go out to battle  that david 
sent joab  and his servants with him  
and all israel  and they destroyed the 
children of ammon  and besieged 
rabbah  but david tarried at 
jerusalem   
2and it came to pass at eventide  
that david arose from off  his bed  and 
walked upon the roof of the king s 
house  and from the roof he saw a 
woman bathing  and the woman was 
very beautiful to look upon  3and 
david sent and inquired after the 
woman  and one said  is not this 
bath sheba  the daughter of eliam  the 
wife of uriah the hittite  4and david 
sent messengers  and took her  and she 
came in unto him  and he lay with her  
for she was purified from her 
uncleanness  and she returned unto her 
house  5and the woman conceived  
and she sent and told david  and sai d 
i am with child   
6and david sent to joab  saying  
send me uriah the hittite  and joab 
sent uriah to david  7and when uriah 11 second samuel  
444 
 was come unto him  david asked of 
him how joab did  and how the people 
fared  and how the war prospered  
8and david said t o uriah  go down 
to thy house  and wash thy feet  and 
uriah departed out of the king s house  
and there followed him a mess of food 
from the king  9but uriah slept at the 
door of the king s house with all the 
servants of his lord  and went not 
down to hi s house  10and when they 
had told david  saying  uriah went 
not down unto his house  david said 
unto uriah  art thou not come from a 
journey  wherefore didst thou not go 
down unto thy house  11and uriah 
said unto david  the ark  and israel  
and judah  abide in booths  and my 
lord joab  and the servants of my lord  
are encamped in the open field  shall i 
then go into my house  to eat and to 
drink  and to lie with my wife  as thou 
livest  and as thy soul liveth  i will not 
do this thing  12and david sai d to 
uriah  tarry here to day also  and to 
morrow i will let thee depart  so 
uriah abode in jerusalem that day  and 
the morrow  13and when david had 
called him  he did eat and drink before 
him and he made him drunk  and at 
even he went out to lie on his  bed with 
the servants of his lord  but went not 
down to his house   
14and it came to pass in the 
morning  that david wrote a letter to 
joab and sent it by the hand of uriah  
15and he wrote in the letter  saying  
set ye uriah in the forefront of the 
hottest battle  and retire ye from him  that he may be smitten  and die  16and 
it came to pass  when joab kept watch 
upon the city  that he assigned uriah 
unto the place where he knew that 
valiant men were  17and the men of 
the city went out  and fought with 
joab and there fell some of the 
people  even of the servants of david  
and uriah the hittite died also  18then 
joab sent and told david all the things 
concerning the war  19and he charged 
the messenger  saying  when thou 
hast made an end of telling all t he 
things concerning the war unto the 
king 20it shall be that  if the king s 
wrath arise  and he say unto thee  
wherefore went ye so nigh unto the 
city to fight  knew ye not that they 
would shoot from the wall  21who 
smote abimelech the son of 
jerubbeshet h did not a woman cast an 
upper millstone upon him from the 
wall that he died at thebez  why went 
ye so nigh the wall  then shalt thou 
say thy servant uriah the hittite is 
dead also   
22so the messenger went  and came 
and told david all that joab had s ent 
him for  23and the messenger said unto 
david  the men prevailed against us  
and came out unto us into the field  
and we were upon them even unto the 
entrance of the gate  24and the 
shooters shot at thy servants from off 
the wall  and some of the king s 
servants are dead  and thy servant 
uriah the hittite is dead also  25then 
david said unto the messenger  thus 
shalt thou say unto joab  let not this second samuel  
445 
 thing displease thee  for the sword 
devoureth in one manner or another  
make thy battle more strong aga inst 
the city  and overthrow it  and 
encourage thou him   
26and when the wife of uriah heard 
that uriah her husband was dead  she 
made lamentation for her husband  
27and when the mourning was past  
david sent and took her home to his 
house  and she became  his wife  and 
bore him a son  but the thing that 
david had done displeased the lord  
and the lord sent nathan 
unto david  and he came unto 
him and said unto him  there were 
two men in one city  the one rich  and 
the other poor  2the rich man had 
exceeding many flocks and herds  3but 
the poor man had nothing save one 
little ewe lamb  which he had bought 
and reared  and it grew up together 
with him  and with his children  it did 
eat of his own morsel  and drank of his 
own cup  and lay in his bosom  and 
was unto him as a daughter  4and there 
came a traveller unto the rich man  and 
he spared to take of his own flock and 
of his own herd  to dress for the 
wayfaring man that was come unto 
him but took the poor man s lamb  
and dressed it for the man that was  
come to him  5and david s anger was 
greatly kindled against the man  and 
he said to nathan  as the lord liveth  
the man that hath done this deserveth 
to die  6and he shall restore the lamb 
fourfold  because he did this thing  and 
because he had no pity   7and nathan said to david  thou 
art the man  thus saith the lord the 
god of israel  i anointed thee king 
over israel  and i delivered thee out of 
the hand of saul  8and i gave thee thy 
master s house  and thy master s wives 
into thy bosom  and gave th ee the 
house of israel and of judah  and if 
that were too little  then would i add 
unto thee so much more  9wherefore 
hast thou despised the word of the 
lord to do that which is evil in my 
sight  uriah the hittite thou hast 
smitten with the sword  and his  wife 
thou hast taken to be thy wife  and him 
thou hast slain with the sword of the 
children of ammon  10now therefore  
the sword shall never depart from thy 
house  because thou hast despised me  
and hast taken the wife of uriah the 
hittite to be thy wife  11thus saith the 
lord behold  i will raise up evil 
against thee out of thine own house  
and i will take thy wives before thine 
eyes and give them unto thy 
neighbour  and he shall lie with thy 
wives in the sight of this sun  12for 
thou didst it secretly  but i will do this 
thing before all israel  and before the 
sun 13and david said unto nathan  i 
have sinned against the lord and 
nathan said unto david  the lord 
also hath put away thy sin  thou shalt 
not die  14howbeit  because by this 
deed thou has t greatly blasphemed the 
enemies of the lord the child also that 
is born unto thee shall surely die  
15and nathan departed unto his house   12 second samuel  
446 
 and the lord struck the child that 
uriah s wife bore unto david  and it 
was very sick  16david therefore 
besought god for the child  and david 
fasted  and as often as he went in  he 
lay all night upon the earth  17and the 
elders of his house arose  and stood 
beside him  to raise him up from the 
earth  but he would not  neither did he 
eat bread with them  18and it came  to 
pass on the seventh day  that the child 
died and the servants of david feared 
to tell him that the child was dead  for 
they said  behold  while the child was 
yet alive  we spoke unto him  and he 
hearkened not unto our voice  how 
then shall we tell hi m that the child is 
dead  so that he do himself some 
harm  19but when david saw that his 
servants whispered together  david 
perceived that the child was dead  and 
david said unto his servants  is the 
child dead  and they said  he is 
dead  20then david  arose from the 
earth  and washed  and anointed 
himself  and changed his apparel  and 
he came into the house of the lord 
and worshipped  then he came to his 
own house  and when he required  they 
set bread before him  and he did eat  
21then said his servan ts unto him  
what thing is this that thou hast done  
thou didst fast and weep for the child  
while it was alive  but when the child 
was dead  thou didst rise and eat 
bread  22and he said  while the child 
was yet alive  i fasted and wept  for i 
said who  knoweth whether the lord 
will not be gracious to me  that the child may live  23but now he is dead  
wherefore should i fast  can i bring 
him back again  i shall go to him  but 
he will not return to me   
24and david comforted bath sheba 
his wife  and went  in unto her  and lay 
with her  and she bore a son  and 
called his name solomon  and the 
lord loved him  25and he sent by the 
hand of nathan the prophet  and he 
called his name ajedidiah  for the 
lords sake  
26now joab fought against rabbah 
of the childr en of ammon  and took 
the royal city  27and joab sent 
messengers to david  and said  i have 
fought against rabbah  yea i have 
taken the city of waters  28now 
therefore gather the rest of the people 
together  and encamp against the city  
and take it  lest i take the city  and it 
be called after my name  29and david 
gathered all the people together  and 
went to rabbah  and fought against it  
and took it  30and he took the crown of 
malcam from off his head  and the 
weight thereof was a talent of gold  
and i n it were precious stones  and it 
was set on david s head  and he 
brought forth the spoil of the city  
exceeding much  31and he brought 
forth the people that were therein  and 
put them under saws  and under 
harrows of iron  and under axes of 
iron and made  them pass through the 
brickkiln  and thus did he unto all the 
cities of the children of ammon  and 
                                                      
a that is beloved of the lord second samuel  
447 
 david and all the people returned unto 
jerusalem   
and it came to pass after this  
that absalom the son of david 
had a fair sister  whose name was 
tamar  and amnon the son of david 
loved her  2and amnon was so 
distressed that he fell sick because of 
his sister tamar  for she was a virgin  
and it seemed hard to amnon to do 
any thing unto her  3but amnon had a 
friend  whose name was jonadab  the 
son of shime ah david s brother  and 
jonadab was a very subtle man  4and 
he said unto him  why  o son of the 
king art thou thus becoming leaner 
from day to day  wilt thou not tell 
me and amnon said unto him  i 
love tamar  my brother absalom s 
sister  5and jonadab  said unto him  
lay thee down on thy bed  and feign 
thyself sick  and when thy father 
cometh to see thee  say unto him  let 
my sister tamar come  i pray thee  and 
give me bread to eat  and dress the 
food in my sight  that i may see it  and 
eat it at her h and 6so amnon lay 
down  and feigned himself sick  and 
when the king was come to see him  
amnon said unto the king  let my 
sister tamar come  i pray thee  and 
make me a couple of cakes in my 
sight  that i may eat at her hand   
7then david sent home to t amar  
saying  go now to thy brother 
amnon s house  and dress him food  
8so tamar went to her brother 
amnon s house  and he was lying 
down  and she took dough  and kneaded it  and made cakes in his 
sight  and did bake the cakes  9and she 
took the pan  and poured them out 
before him  but he refused to eat  and 
amnon said  have out all men from 
me and they went out every man 
from him  10and amnon said unto 
tamar  bring the food into the 
chamber  that i may eat of thy hand  
and tamar took the cakes which  she 
had made  and brought them into the 
chamber to amnon her brother  11and 
when she had brought them near unto 
him to eat  he took hold of her  and 
said unto her  come lie with me  my 
sister  12and she answered him  nay 
my brother  do not force me  for no 
such thing ought to be done in israel  
do not thou this wanton deed  13and i  
whither shall i carry my shame  and as 
for thee  thou wilt be as one of the 
base men in israel  now therefore  i 
pray thee  speak unto the king  for he 
will not withhold me  from thee  
14howbeit he would not hearken unto 
her voice  but being stronger than she  
he forced her  and lay with her   
15then amnon hated her with 
exceeding great hatred  for the hatred 
wherewith he hated her was greater 
than the love wherewith he had loved 
her and amnon said unto her  arise  
be gone  16and she said unto him  
not so  because this great wrong in 
putting me forth is worse than the 
other that thou didst unto me  but he 
would not hearken unto her  17then he 
called his servant that mini stered unto 
him and said  put now this woman 13 second samuel  
448 
 out from me  and bolt the door after 
her18now she had a garment of 
many colours upon her  for with such 
robes were the king s daughters that 
were virgins apparelled and his 
servant brought her out  and bol ted the 
door after her  19and tamar put ashes 
on her head  and rent her garment of 
many colours that was on her  and she 
laid her hand on her head  and went 
her way  crying aloud as she went   
20and absalom her brother said 
unto her  hath aamnon thy broth er 
been with thee  but now hold thy 
peace  my sister  he is thy brother  take 
not this thing to heart  so tamar 
remained desolate in her brother  
absalom s house  21but when king 
david heard of all these things  he was 
very wroth  22and absalom spoke unto  
amnon neither good nor bad  for 
absalom hated amnon  because he 
had forced his sister tamar   
23and it came to pass after two full 
years  that absalom had sheep 
shearers in baal hazor  which is beside 
ephraim  and absalom invited all the 
kings sons  24and absalom came to 
the king  and said  behold now  thy 
servant hath sheep shearers  let the 
king i pray thee  and his servants go 
with thy servant  25and the king said 
to absalom  nay my son  let us not 
all go  lest we be burdensome unto 
thee and he pressed him  howbeit he 
would not go  but blessed him  26then 
said absalom  if not  i pray thee  let 
                                                      
a heb aminon  my brother amnon go with us  and 
the king said unto him  why should 
he go with thee  27but absalom 
pressed him  and he let amnon and all 
the king s son s go with him  28and 
absalom commanded his servants  
saying  mark ye now  when amnon s 
heart is merry with wine  and when i 
say unto you  smite amnon  then kill 
him fear not  have not i commanded 
you be courageous  and be valiant  
29and the servants of  absalom did 
unto amnon as absalom had 
commanded  then all the king s sons 
arose  and every man got him up upon 
his mule  and fled   
30and it came to pass  while they 
were in the way  that the tidings came 
to david  saying  absalom hath slain 
all the king s sons  and there is not one 
of them left  31then the king arose  
and rent his garments  and lay on the 
earth  and all his servants stood by 
with their clothes rent  32and jonadab  
the son of shimeah david s brother  
answered and said  let not my lord 
suppose that they have killed all the 
young men the king s sons  for amnon 
only is dead  for by the appointment of 
absalom this hath been determined 
from the day that he forced his sister 
tamar  33now therefore let not my 
lord the king take the thing to his  
heart  to think that all the king s sons 
are dead  for amnon only is dead   
34but absalom fled  and the young 
man that kept the watch lifted up his 
eyes and looked  and behold  there 
came much people in a roundabout second samuel  
449 
 way by the hill side 35and jonadab 
said unto the king  behold  the king s 
sons are come  as thy servant said  so 
it is 36and it came to pass  as soon as 
he had made an end of speaking  that 
behold  the king s sons came  and 
lifted up their voice  and wept  and the 
king also and all his servants wept 
very sore   
37but absalom fled  and went to 
talmai the son of ammihud  king of 
geshur  and david  mourned for his 
son every day   
38so absalom fled  and went to 
geshur  and was there three years  
39and the soul of king david failed 
with long ing for absalom  for he was 
comforted concerning amnon  seeing 
he was dead   
now joab the son of zeruiah 
perceived that the king s heart 
was toward absalom  2and joab sent 
to tekoa  and fetched thence a wise 
woman  and said unto her  i pray thee  
feign  thyself to be a mourner  and put 
on mourning apparel  i pray thee  and 
anoint not thyself with oil  but be as a 
woman that had a long time mourned 
for the dead  3and go in to the king  
and speak on this manner unto him  
so joab put the words in her mouth   
4and when the woman of tekoa 
spoke to the king  she fell on her face 
to the ground  and prostrated herself  
and said  help  o king  5and the 
king said unto her  what aileth thee  
and she answered  of a truth i am a 
widow  my husband being dead  6and 
thy handmaid had two sons  and they two strove together in the field  and 
there was none to part them  but the 
one smote the other  and killed him  
7and behold  the whole family is risen 
against thy handmaid  and they said  
deliver him that smote his br other  
that we may kill him for the life of his 
brother whom he slew  and so destroy 
the heir also  thus will they quench 
my coal which is left  and will leave to 
my husband neither name nor 
remainder upon the face of the earth   
8and the king said unto t he woman  
go to thy house  and i will give 
charge concerning thee  9and the 
woman of tekoa said unto the king  
my lord  o king  the iniquity be on 
me and on my father s house  and the 
king and his throne be guiltless  10and 
the king said  whosoever s aith aught 
unto thee  bring him to me  and he 
shall not touch thee any more  11then 
said she  i pray thee  let the king 
remember the lord thy god  that the 
avenger of blood destroy not any 
more  lest they destroy my son  and 
he said  as the lord liveth  there shall 
not one hair of thy son fall to the 
earth   
12then the woman said  let thy 
handmaid  i pray thee  speak a word 
unto my lord the king  and he said  
say on  13and the woman said  
wherefore then hast thou devised 
such a thing against the p eople of 
god for in speaking this word the 
king is as one that is guilty  in that the 
king doth not fetch home again his 
banished one  14for we must needs die  14 second samuel  
450 
 and are as water spilt on the ground  
which cannot be gathered up again  
neither doth god respe ct any person  
but let him devise means  that he that 
is banished be not an outcast from 
him 15now therefore seeing that i am 
come to speak this word unto my lord 
the king  it is because the people have 
made me afraid  and thy handmaid 
said i will now sp eak unto the king  it 
may be that the king will perform the 
request of his servant  16for the king 
will hear  to deliver his servant out of 
the hand of the man that would destroy 
me and my son together out of the 
inheritance of god  17then thy 
handmaid sai d let i pray thee  the 
word of my lord the king be for my 
comfort  for as an angel of god  so is 
my lord the king to discern good and 
bad and the lord thy god be with 
thee  
18then the king answered and said 
unto the woman  hide not from me  i 
pray th ee aught that i shall ask thee  
and the woman said  let my lord the 
king now speak  19and the king said  
is the hand of joab with thee in all 
this and the woman answered and 
said as thy soul liveth  my lord the 
king none can turn to the right han d or 
to the left from aught that my lord the 
king hath spoken  for thy servant joab  
he bade me  and he put all these words 
in the mouth of thy handmaid  20to 
change the face of the matter hath thy 
servant joab done this thing  and my 
lord is wise  accordi ng to the wisdom of an angel of god  to know all things 
that are in the earth   
21and the king said unto joab  
behold now  i have granted this 
request  go therefore  bring the young 
man absalom back  22and joab fell to 
the ground on his face  and prostr ated 
himself  and blessed the king  and joab 
said today thy servant knoweth that 
i have found favour in thy sight  my 
lord o king  in that the king hath 
performed the request of thy servant  
23so joab arose and went to geshur  
and brought absalom to j erusalem  
24and the king said  let him turn to 
his own house  but let him not see my 
face so absalom turned to his own 
house  and saw not the king s face   
25now in all israel there was none to 
be so much praised as absalom for his 
beauty  from the sole  of his foot even 
to the crown of his head there was no 
blemish in him  26and when he polled 
his head now it was at every year s 
end that he polled it  because the hair 
was heavy on him  therefore he polled 
ithe weighed the hair of his head at 
two hundred  shekels  after the king s 
weight  27and unto absalom there 
were born three sons  and one 
daughter  whose name was tamar  she 
was a woman of a fair countenance   
28and absalom dwelt two full years 
in jerusalem  and he saw not the kings 
face 29then absalom  sent for joab  to 
send him to the king  but he would not 
come to him  and he sent again a 
second time  but he would not come  
30therefore he said unto his servants  second samuel  
451 
 see joabs field is near mine  and he 
hath barley there  go and set it on fire  
and abs alom s servants set the field 
on fire  31then joab arose  and came to 
absalom unto his house  and said unto 
him wherefore have thy servants set 
my field on fire  32and absalom 
answered joab  behold  i sent unto 
thee saying  come hither  that i may 
send thee to the king  to say  
wherefore am i come from geshur  it 
were better for me to be there still  
now therefore let me see the king s 
face and if there be iniquity in me  let 
him kill me  33so joab came to the 
king and told him  and when he had 
called for absalom  he came to the 
king and bowed himself on his face to 
the ground before the king  and the 
king kissed absalom   
and it came to pass after this  
that absalom prepared him a 
chariot and horses  and fifty men to 
run before him  2and absalom  used to 
rise up early  and stand beside the way 
of the gate  and it was so  that when 
any man had a suit which should come 
to the king for judgment  then 
absalom called unto him  and said  
of what city art thou  and he said  
thy servant is of one of th e tribes of 
israel  3and absalom said unto him  
see thy matters are good and right  
but there is no man deputed of the king 
to hear thee  4absalom said moreover  
oh that i were made judge in the land  
that every man who hath any suit or 
cause might co me unto me  and i 
would do him justice   5and it was so  that when any man came nigh to 
prostrate himself before him  he put 
forth his hand  and took hold of him  
and kissed him  6and on this manner 
did absalom to all israel that came to 
the king for judg ment  so absalom 
stole the hearts of the men of israel   
7and it came to pass at the end of 
forty years  that absalom said unto the 
king i pray thee  let me go and pay 
my vow  which i have vowed unto the 
lord in hebron  8for thy servant 
vowed a vow whil e i abode at geshur 
in aram  saying  if the lord shall 
indeed bring me back to jerusalem  
then i will serve the lord 9and the 
king said unto him  go in peace  so 
he arose  and went to hebron  10but 
absalom sent spies throughout all the 
tribes of israel  saying  as soon as ye 
hear the sound of the horn  then ye 
shall say  absalom is king in hebron  
11and with absalom went two 
hundred men out of jerusalem  that 
were invited  and went in their 
simplicity  and they knew not any 
thing  12and absalom sent f or 
ahithophel the gilonite  david s 
counsellor  from his city  even from 
giloh  while he offered the sacrifices  
and the conspiracy was strong  for the 
people increased continually with 
absalom   
13and there came a messenger to 
david  saying  the hearts o f the men 
of israel are after absalom  14and 
david said unto all his servants that 
were with him at jerusalem  arise  
and let us flee  for else none of us shall 15 second samuel  
452 
 escape from absalom  make speed to 
depart  lest he overtake us quickly  and 
bring down evil u pon us  and smite the 
city with the edge of the sword  15and 
the king s servants said unto the king  
behold  thy servants are ready to do 
whatsoever my lord the king shall 
choose  16and the king went forth  
and all his household after him  and 
the king left ten women  that were 
concubines  to keep the house  17and 
the king went forth  and all the people 
after him  and they tarried in beth 
merhak  18and all his servants passed 
on beside him  and all the cherethites  
and all the pelethites  and all the 
gittites six hundred men that came 
after him from gath  passed on before 
the king   
19then said the king to ittai the 
gittite  wherefore goest thou also 
with us  return  and abide with the 
king for thou art a foreigner  and also 
an exile from thine own pla ce 
20whereas thou camest but yesterday  
should i this day make thee go up and 
down with us  seeing i go whither i 
may return thou  and take back thy 
brethren with thee in kindness and 
truth  21and ittai answered the king  
and said  as the lord liveth  and as 
my lord the king liveth  surely in what 
place my lord the king shall be  
whether for death or for life  even 
there also will thy servant be  22and 
david said to ittai  go and pass over  
and ittai the gittite passed over  and 
all his men  and all the little ones that 
were with him  23and all the country wept with a loud voice  as all the 
people passed over  and as the king 
passed over the brook kidron  all the 
people passed over  toward the way of 
the wilderness   
24and lo zadok also came  and al l 
the levites with him  bearing the ark 
of the covenant of god  and they set 
down the ark of god but abiathar 
went up until all the people had done 
passing out of the city  25and the king 
said unto zadok  carry back the ark 
of god into the city  if i shal l find 
favour in the eyes of the lord he will 
bring me back  and show me both it  
and his habitation  26but if he say 
thus i have no delight in thee  behold  
here am i  let him do to me as seemeth 
good unto him  27the king said also 
unto zadok the pries t seest thou  
return into the city in peace  and your 
two sons with you  ahimaaz thy son  
and jonathan the son of abiathar  
28see i will tarry in the plains of the 
wilderness  until there come word 
from you to announce unto me  
29zadok therefore and ab iathar carried 
the ark of god back to jerusalem  and 
they abode there   
30and david went up by the ascent 
of the mount of olives  and wept as he 
went up  and he had his head covered  
and went barefoot  and all the people 
that were with him covered every ma n 
his head  and they went up  weeping as 
they went up  31and one told david  
saying  ahithophel is among the 
conspirators with absalom  and 
david said  o lord i pray thee  turn second samuel  
453 
 the counsel of ahithophel into 
foolishness  32and it came to pass  
that wh en david was come to the top 
of the ascent  where god was wont to 
be worshipped  behold  hushai the 
archite came to meet him with his 
coat rent  and earth upon his head  
33and david said unto him  if thou 
passest on with me  then thou wilt be a 
burden unt o me  34but if thou return to 
the city  and say unto absalom  i will 
be thy servant  o king  as i have been 
thy father s servant in time past  so 
will i now be thy servant  then wilt 
thou defeat for me the counsel of 
ahithophel  35and hast thou not there 
with thee zadok and abiathar the 
priests  therefore it shall be  that what 
thing soever thou shalt hear out of the 
kings house  thou shalt tell it to zadok 
and abiathar the priests  36behold  
they have there with them their two 
sons ahimaaz zadok s son  and 
jonathan abiathar s son  and by them 
ye shall send unto me every thing that 
ye shall hear  37so hushai david s 
friend came into the city  and absalom 
was at the point of coming into 
jerusalem   
and when david was a little 
past the top  behold  ziba the 
servant of mephibosheth met him  
with a couple of asses saddled  and 
upon them two hundred loaves of 
bread  and a hundred clusters of 
raisins  and a hundred of summer 
fruits  and a bottle of wine  2and the 
king said unto ziba  what meanest 
thou by the se and ziba said  the asses are for the king s household to 
ride on  and the bread and summer 
fruit for the young men to eat  and the 
wine  that such as are faint in the 
wilderness may drink  3and the king 
said and where is thy master s son  
and zib a said unto the king  behold  
he abideth at jerusalem  for he said  
today will the house of israel restore 
me the kingdom of my father  4then 
said the king to ziba  behold  thine is 
all that pertaineth unto mephibosheth  
and ziba said  i prostrate my self let 
me find favour in thy sight  my lord  o 
king  
5and when king david came to 
bahurim  behold  there came out 
thence a man of the family of the 
house of saul  whose name was 
shimei  the son of gera  he came out  
and kept on cursing as he came  6and 
he cast stones at david  and at all the 
servants of king david  and all the 
people and all the mighty men were on 
his right hand and on his left  7and 
thus said shimei when he cursed  
begone  begone  thou man of blood  
and base fellow  8the lord hath 
returned upon thee all the blood of the 
house of saul  in whose stead thou 
hast reigned  and the lord hath 
delivered the kingdom into the hand of 
absalom thy son  and behold  thou art 
taken in thine own mischief  because 
thou art a man of blood   
9then sai d abishai the son of 
zeruiah unto the king  why should 
this dead dog curse my lord the king  
let me go over  i pray thee  and take 16 second samuel  
454 
 off his head  10and the king said  
what have i to do with you  ye sons 
of zeruiah  so let him curse  because 
the lord hath said unto him  curse 
david  who then shall say  wherefore 
hast thou done so  11and david said 
to abishai  and to all his servants  
behold  my son  who came forth of 
my body  seeketh my life  how much 
more this benjamite now  let him 
alone  and let him c urse for the lord 
hath bidden him  12it may be that the 
lord will look on mine eye  and that 
the lord will requite me good for his 
cursing of me this day  13so david 
and his men went by the way  and 
shimei went along on the hill side 
over against him  and cursed as he 
went  and threw stones at him  and cast 
dust 14and the king  and all the people 
that were with him  came weary  and 
he refreshed himself there   
15and absalom  and all the people  
the men of israel  came to jerusalem  
and ahithophel with hi m 16and it 
came to pass  when hushai the 
archite  david s friend  was come 
unto absalom  that hushai said unto 
absalom  long live the king  long 
live the king  17and absalom said to 
hushai  is this thy kindness to thy 
friend  why wentest thou not with thy 
friend  18and hushai said unto 
absalom  nay but whom the lord 
and this people  and all the men of 
israel have chosen  his will i be  and 
with him will i abide  19and again  
whom should i serve  should i not 
serve in the presence of his son  as i have served in thy father s presence  
so will i be in thy presence   
20then said absalom to ahithophel  
give your counsel what we shall do  
21and ahithophel said unto absalom  
go in unto thy father s concubines  
that he hath left to keep the house  and 
all israel will hear that thou art 
abhorred of thy father  then will the 
hands of all that are with thee be 
strong  22so they spread absalom a 
tent upon the top of the house  and 
absalom went in unto his father s 
concubines in the sight of all israel  
23now the counsel of ahithophel  
which he counselled in those days  was 
as if a man inquired of the word of 
god so was all the counsel of 
ahithophel both with david and with 
absalom   
moreover ahithophel said 
unto absalom  let me now 
choose out twelve th ousand men  and i 
will arise and pursue after david this 
night  2and i will come upon him while 
he is weary and weak handed  and will 
make him afraid  and all the people 
that are with him shall flee  and i will 
smite the king only  3and i will bring 
back a ll the people unto thee  when all 
shall have returned  save the man 
whom thou seekest  all the people will 
be in peace  4and the saying pleased 
absalom well  and all the elders of 
israel   
5then said absalom  call now 
hushai the archite also  and let u s 
hear likewise what he saith  6and 
when hushai was come to absalom  17 second samuel  
455 
 absalom spoke unto him  saying  
ahithophel hath spoken after this 
manner  shall we do after his saying  
if not  speak thou  7and hushai said 
unto absalom  the counsel that 
ahithophel hath given this time is not 
good  8hushai said moreover  thou 
knowest thy father and his men  that 
they are mighty men  and they are 
embittered in their minds  as a bear 
robbed of her whelps in the field  and 
thy father is a man of war  and will not 
lodge with the people  9behold  he is 
hid now in some pit  or in some place  
and it will come to pass  when they fall 
upon them at the first  and whosoever 
heareth it shall say  there is a 
slaughter among the people that follow 
absalom  10then even he that is 
valiant  whose heart is as the heart of a 
lion will utterly melt  for all israel 
knoweth that thy father is a mighty 
man and they that are with him are 
valiant men  11but i counsel that all 
israel be gathered together unto thee  
from dan even to beer sheba as the 
sand that is by the sea for multitude  
and that thou go to battle in thine own 
person  12so shall we come upon him 
in some place where he shall be found  
and we will light upon him as the dew 
falleth on the ground  and of him and 
of all the men that are with him we 
will not leave so much as one  
13moreover  if he withdraw himself 
into a city  then shall all israel bring up 
ropes to that city  and we will draw it 
into the valley until there be not one 
small stone found there  14and absalom and al l the men of israel said  
the counsel of hushai the archite is 
better than the counsel of 
ahithophel for the lord had 
ordained to defeat the good counsel of 
ahithophel  to the intent that the lord 
might bring evil upon absalom   
15then said hushai unto zadok and 
to abiathar the priests  thus and thus 
did ahithophel counsel absalom and 
the elders of israel  and thus and thus 
have i counselled  16now therefore 
send quickly  and tell david  saying  
lodge not this night in the plains of 
the wilderness  but in any wise pass 
over lest the king be swallowed up  
and all the people that are with him  
17now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed 
by en rogel  and a maid servant used 
to go and tell them  and they went and 
told king david  for they might not be 
seen to come i nto the city  18but a lad 
saw them  and told absalom  and they 
went both of them away quickly  and 
came to the house of a man in 
bahurim  who had a well in his court  
and they went down thither  19and the 
woman took and spread the covering 
over the well s mouth  and strewed 
groats thereon  and nothing was 
known  20and absalom s servants 
came to the woman to the house  and 
they said  where are ahimaaz and 
jonathan  and the woman said unto 
them  they are gone over the brook 
of water  and when they had sou ght 
and could not find them  they returned 
to jerusalem   second samuel  
456 
 21and it came to pass  after they 
were departed  that they came up out 
of the well  and went and told king 
david  and they said unto david  
arise ye  and pass quickly over the 
water  for thus hath ahithophel 
counselled against you  22then david 
arose  and all the people that were with 
him and they passed over the jordan  
by the morning light there lacked not 
one of them that was not gone over the 
jordan   
23and when ahithophel saw that his 
counsel  was not followed  he saddled 
his ass  and arose  and got him home  
unto his city  and set his house in 
order  and strangled himself  and he 
died and was buried in the sepulchre 
of his father  24when david was come 
to mahanaim  absalom passed over 
the jor dan he and all the men of israel 
with him  25and absalom had set 
amasa over the host instead of joab  
now amasa was the son of a man  
whose name was ithra the jesraelite  
that went in to abigal the daughter of 
nahash  sister to zeruiah joab s 
mother  26and israel and absalom 
pitched in the land of gilead   
27and it came to pass  when david 
was come to mahanaim  that shobi the 
son of nahash of rabbah of the 
children of ammon  and machir the 
son of ammiel of lo debar  and 
barzillai the gileadite of rogelim  
28brought beds  and basins  and earthen 
vessels  and wheat  and barley  and 
meal  and parched corn  and beans  
and lentils  and parched pulse  29and honey  and curd  and sheep  and 
cheese of kine  for david  and for the 
people that were with him  to eat  for 
they said  the people is hungry  and 
faint and thirsty  in the wilderness   
and david numbered the 
people that were with him  and 
set captains of thousands and captains 
of hundreds over them  2and david 
sent forth the people  a third part under 
the hand of joab  and a third part under 
the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah  
joabs brother  and a third part under 
the hand of ittai the gittite  and the 
king said unto the people  i will 
surely go forth with you myself also  
3but the people said  thou shalt not 
go forth  for if we flee away  they will 
not care for us  neither if half of us die  
will they care for us  but thou art 
worth ten thousand of us  therefore 
now it is better that thou be ready to 
succour us out of the city  4and the 
king said  unto them  what seemeth 
you best i will do  and the king stood 
by the gate side and all the people 
went out by hundreds and by 
thousands  5and the king commanded 
joab and abishai and ittai  saying  
deal gently for my sake with the 
young man  even with  absalom  and 
all the people heard when the king 
gave all the captains charge 
concerning absalom   
6so the people went out into the 
field against israel  and the battle was 
in the forest of ephraim  7and the 
people of israel were smitten there 
before the servants of david  and there 18 second samuel  
457 
 was a great slaughter there that day of 
twenty thousand men  8for the battle 
was there spread over the face of all 
the country  and the forest devoured 
more people that day than the sword 
devoured   
9and absalom chanced to meet  the 
servants of david  and absalom was 
riding upon his mule  and the mule 
went under the thick boughs of a great 
terebinth  and his head caught hold of 
the terebinth  and he was taken up 
between the heaven and the earth  and 
the mule that was under him we nt on  
10and a certain man saw it  and told 
joab and said  behold  i saw 
absalom hanging in a terebinth  
11and joab said unto the man that told 
him and behold  thou sawest it  and 
why didst thou not smite him there to 
the ground  and i would have had  to 
give thee ten pieces of silver  and a 
girdle  12and the man said unto joab  
though i should receive a thousand 
pieces of silver in my hand  yet would 
i not put forth my hand against the 
kings son  for in our hearing the king 
charged thee and abishai  and ittai  
saying  beware that none touch the 
young man absalom  13otherwise if i 
had dealt falsely against mine own 
lifeand there is no matter hid from 
the king then thou thyself wouldest 
have stood aloof  14then said joab  i 
may not tarry thus with t hee and he 
took three darts in his hand  and thrust 
them through the heart of absalom  
while he was yet alive in the midst of 
the terebinth  15and ten young men that bore joab s armour compassed 
about and smote absalom  and slew 
him  
16and joab blew the  horn and the 
people returned from pursuing after 
israel  for joab held back the people  
17and they took absalom  and cast 
him into the great pit in the forest  and 
raised over him a very great heap of 
stones  and all israel fled every one to 
his tent 18now absalom in his life 
time had taken and reared up for 
himself the pillar  which is in the 
kings dale  for he said  i have no son 
to keep my name in remembrance  
and he called the pillar after his own 
name  and it is called absalom s 
monument unto thi s day   
19then said ahimaaz the son of 
zadok  let me now run  and bear the 
king tidings  how that the lord hath 
avenged him of his enemies  20and 
joab said unto him  thou shalt not be 
the bearer of tidings this day  but thou 
shalt bear tidings another d ay but this 
day thou shalt bear no tidings  
forasmuch as the king s son is dead  
21then said joab to the cushite  go 
tell the king what thou hast seen  and 
the cushite bowed down unto joab  
and ran  22then said ahimaaz the son 
of zadok yet again to joa b but come 
what may  let me  i pray thee  also run 
after the cushite  and joab said  
wherefore wilt thou run  my son  
seeing that thou wilt have no reward 
for the tidings  23but come what 
may said he  i will run  and he said 
unto him  run then  ahimaaz ran by second samuel  
458 
 the way of the plain  and overran the 
cushite   
24now david sat between the two 
gates  and the watchman went up to 
the roof of the gate unto the wall  and 
lifted up his eyes  and looked  and 
behold a man running alone  25and the 
watchman cr ied and told the king  
and the king said  if he be alone  
there is tidings in his mouth  and he 
came apace  and drew near  26and the 
watchman saw another man running  
and the watchman called unto the 
porter  and said  behold another man 
running alone  and the king said  he 
also bringeth tidings  27and the 
watchman said  i think the running of 
the foremost is like the running of 
ahimaaz the son of zadok  and the 
king said  he is a good man  and 
cometh with good tidings   
28and ahimaaz called  and said unto 
the king  all is well  and he bowed 
down before the king with his face to 
the earth  and said  blessed be the 
lord thy god  who hath delivered up 
the men that lifted up their hand 
against my lord the king  29and the 
king said  is it well wit h the young 
man absalom  and ahimaaz 
answered  when joab sent the king s 
servant  and me thy servant  i saw a 
great tumult  but i knew not what it 
was 30and the king said  turn aside  
and stand here  and he turned aside  
and stood still   
31and beho ld the cushite came  
and the cushite said  tidings for my 
lord the king  for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that 
rose up against thee  32and the king 
said unto the cushite  is it well with 
the young man absalom  and the 
cushite answer ed the enemies of my 
lord the king and all that rise up 
against thee to do thee hurt  be as that 
young man is   
and the king was much 
moved  and went up to the 
chamber over the gate  and wept  and 
as he went  thus he said  o my son 
absalom  my son  my son absalom  
would i had died for thee  o absalom  
my son  my son    
2and it was told joab  behold  the 
king weepeth and mourneth for 
absalom  3 and the victory that day 
was turned into mourning unto all the 
people  for the people heard say that 
day the king grieveth for his son  
4and the people got them by stealth 
that day into the city  as people that are 
ashamed steal away when they flee in 
battle  5and the king covered his face  
and the king cried with a loud voice  
o my son absalom  o absalom  my 
son my son   6and joab came into 
the house to the king  and said  thou 
hast shamed this day the faces of all 
thy servants  who this day have saved 
thy life  and the lives of thy sons and 
of thy daughters  and the lives of thy 
wives  and the lives o f thy concubines  
7in that thou lovest them that hate thee  
and hatest them that love thee  for 
thou hast declared this day  that 
princes and servants are nought unto 
thee for this day i perceive  that if 19 second samuel  
459 
 absalom had lived  and all we had 
died this day  then it had pleased thee 
well 8now therefore arise  go forth  
and speak to the heart of thy servants  
for i swear by the lord if thou go not 
forth  there will not tarry a man with 
thee this night  and that will be worse 
unto thee than all the evil that ha th 
befallen thee from thy youth until 
now 9then the king arose  and sat in 
the gate  and they told unto all the 
people  saying  behold  the king doth 
sit in the gate  and all the people came 
before the king   
now israel had fled every man to 
his tent  10and all the people were at 
strife throughout all the tribes of israel  
saying  the king delivered us out of 
the hand of our enemies  and he saved 
us out of the hand of the philistines  
and now he is fled out of the land from 
absalom  11and absalom  whom  we 
anointed over us  is dead in battle  
now  therefore  why speak ye not a 
word of bringing the king back   
12and king david sent to zadok and 
to abiathar the priests  saying  speak 
unto the elders of judah  saying  why 
are ye the last to bring the king  back to 
his house for the speech of all 
israel was come to the king  to bring 
him to his house 13ye are my 
brethren  ye are my bone and my flesh  
wherefore then should ye be the last to 
bring back the king  14and say ye to 
amasa  art thou not my bone an d my 
flesh  god do so to me  and more also  
if thou be not captain of the host 
before me continually in the room of joab 15and he bowed the heart of all 
the men of judah  even as the heart of 
one man  so that they sent unto the 
king return thou  and al l thy 
servants   
16so the king returned  and came to 
the jordan  and judah came to gilgal  
to go to meet the king  to bring the 
king over the jordan  17and shimei the 
son of gera  the benjamite  who was 
of bahurim  made haste and came 
down with the men of  judah to meet 
king david  18and there were a 
thousand men of benjamin with him  
and ziba the servant of the house of 
saul and his fifteen sons and his 
twenty servants with him  and they 
rushed into the jordan before the king  
19and the ferryboat passed t o and fro 
to bring over the king s household  and 
to do what he thought good  and 
shimei the son of gera fell down 
before the king  when he would go 
over the jordan  20and he said unto the 
king let not my lord impute iniquity 
unto me  neither do thou rem ember 
that which thy servant did iniquitously 
the day that my lord the king went out 
of jerusalem  that the king should take 
it to his heart  21for thy servant doth 
know that i have sinned  therefore  
behold  i am come this day the first of 
all the house o f joseph to go down to 
meet my lord the king  22but abishai 
the son of zeruiah answered and said  
shall not shimei be put to death for 
this because he cursed the l ords 
anointed  23and david said  what 
have i to do with you  ye sons of second samuel  
460 
 zeruiah  that y e should this day be 
adversaries unto me  shall there any 
man be put to death this day in israel  
for do not i know that i am this day 
king over israel  24and the king said 
unto shimei  thou shalt not die  and 
the king swore unto him   
25and mephiboshet h the son of saul 
came down to meet the king  and he 
had neither dressed his feet  nor 
trimmed his beard  nor washed his 
clothes  from the day the king departed 
until the day he came home in peace  
26and it came to pass  when he was 
come to jerusalem to me et the king  
that the king said unto him  
wherefore wentest not thou with me  
mephibosheth  27and he answered  
my lord  o king  my servant deceived 
me for thy servant said  i will saddle 
me an ass  that i may ride thereon  and 
go with the king  because  thy servant 
is lame  28and he hath slandered thy 
servant unto my lord the king  but my 
lord the king is as an angel of god  do 
therefore what is good in thine eyes  
29for all my father s house were 
deserving of death at the hand of my 
lord the king  yet d idst thou set thy 
servant among them that did eat at 
thine own table  what right therefore 
have i yet  or why should i cry any 
more unto the king  30and the king 
said unto him  why speakest thou any 
more of thy matters  i say  thou and 
ziba divide the la nd 31and 
mephibosheth said unto the king  
yea let him take all  forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto 
his own house   
32and barzillai the gileadite came 
down from rogelim  and he passed on 
to jordan with the king  to bring him 
on the way  over the jordan  33now 
barzillai was a very aged man  even 
fourscore years old  and he had 
provided the king with sustenance 
while he lay at mahanaim  for he was 
a very great man  34and the king said 
unto barzillai  come thou over with 
me and i will sus tain thee with me in 
jerusalem  35and barzillai said unto 
the king  how many are the days of 
the years of my life  that i should go 
up with the king unto jerusalem  36i 
am this day fourscore years old  can i 
discern between good and bad  can 
thy servant taste what i eat or what i 
drink  can i hear any more the voice 
of singing men and singing women  
wherefore then should thy servant be 
yet a burden unto my lord the king  
37thy servant would but just go over 
the jordan with the king  and why 
should the kin g recompense it me with 
such a reward  38let thy servant  i 
pray thee  turn back  that i may die in 
mine own city  by the grave of my 
father and my mother  but behold thy 
servant chimham  let him go over 
with my lord the king  and do to him 
what shall seem  good unto thee  
39and the king answered  chimham 
shall go over with me  and i will do to 
him that which shall seem good unto 
thee and whatsoever thou shalt require 
of me  that will i do for thee  40and second samuel  
461 
 all the people went over the jordan  
and the king  went over  and the king 
kissed barzillai  and blessed him  and 
he returned unto his own place   
41so the king went over to gilgal  
and achimham went over with him  
and all the people of judah brought the 
king over  and also half the people of 
israel  42and behold  all the men of 
israel came to the king  and said unto 
the king  why have our brethren the 
men of judah stolen thee away  and 
brought the king  and his household  
over the jordan  and all david s men 
with him  43and all the men of judah 
answere d the men of israel  because 
the king is near of kin to us  wherefore 
then are ye angry for this matter  have 
we eaten at all of the king s cost  or 
hath any gift been given us  44and the 
men of israel answered the men of 
judah  and said  we have ten pa rts in 
the king  and we have also more right 
in david than ye  why then did ye 
despise us  that our advice should not 
be first had in bringing back our king  
and the words of the men of judah 
were fiercer than the words of the men 
of israel   
now there  happened to be 
there a base fellow  whose 
name was sheba  the son of bichri  a 
benjamite  and he blew the horn  and 
said we have no portion in david  
neither have we inheritance in the son 
of jesse  every man to his tents  o 
israel  2so all the men of israel went 
                                                      
a heb chimhan  up from following david  and 
followed sheba the son of bichri  but 
the men of judah did cleave unto their 
king from the jordan even to 
jerusalem   
3and david came to his house at 
jerusalem  and the king took the ten 
women his concubines  whom he had 
left to keep the house  and put them in 
ward  and provided them with 
sustenance  but went not in unto them  
so they were shut up unto the day of 
their death  in widowhood  with their 
husband alive   
4then said the king to amasa  call 
me the men of judah together within 
three days  and be thou here present  
5so amasa went to call the men of 
judah together  but he tarried longer 
than the set time which he had 
appointed him  6and david said to 
abishai  now will sheba the son of 
bichri do us more harm  than did 
absalom  take thou thy lord s 
servants  and pursue after him  lest he 
get him fortified cities  and escape out 
of our sight  7and there went out after 
him joab s men  and the cherethites 
and the pelethites  and all the mighty 
men and they went out of jerusalem  
to pursue after sheba the son of bichri  
8when they were at the great stone 
which is in gibeon  amasa came to 
meet them  and joab was girded with 
his apparel of war that he had put on  
and thereon was a girdle with a sword 
fastened upon h is loins in the sheath 
thereof  and as he went forth it fell out  
9and joab said to amasa  is it well 20 second samuel  
462 
 with thee  my brother  and joab took 
amasa by the beard with his right 
hand to kiss him  10but amasa took no 
heed to the sword that was in joab s 
hand  so he smote him therewith in the 
groin  and shed out his bowels to the 
ground  and struck him not again  and 
he died   
and joab and abishai his brother 
pursued after sheba the son of bichri  
11and there stood by him one of joab s 
young men  and said  he t hat 
favoureth joab  and he that is for 
david let him follow joab  12and 
amasa lay wallowing in his blood in 
the midst of the highway  and when 
the man saw that all the people stood 
still he carried amasa out of the 
highway into the field  and cast a 
garm ent over him  when he saw that 
every one that came by him stood still  
13when he was removed out of the 
highway  all the people went on after 
joab to pursue after sheba the son of 
bichri   
14and he went through all the tribes 
of israel unto abel  and to b eth
maacah  and all the berites  and they 
were gathered together  and went in 
also after him  15and they came and 
besieged him in abel of beth maacah  
and they cast up a mound against the 
city and it stood in the moat  and all 
the people that were with jo ab battered 
the wall  to throw it down   
16then cried a wise woman out of 
the city  hear  hear say i pray you  
unto joab  come near hither  that i 
may speak with thee  17and he came near unto her  and the woman said  
art thou joab  and he answered  i 
am then she said unto him  hear the 
words of thy handmaid  and he 
answered  i do hear  18then she 
spoke  saying  they were wont to 
speak in old time  saying  they shall 
surely ask counsel at abel  and so they 
ended the matter  19we are of them 
that are peaceable and faithful in 
israel  seekest thou to destroy a city 
and a mother in israel  why wilt thou 
swallow up the inheritance of the 
lord 20and joab answered and said  
far be it  far be it from me  that i 
should swallow up or destroy  21the 
matter is not so  but a man of the hill 
country of ephraim  sheba the son of 
bichri by name  hath lifted up his hand 
against the king  even against david  
deliver him only  and i will depart 
from the city  and the woman said 
unto joab  behold  his head sha ll be 
thrown to thee over the wall  22then 
the woman went unto all the people in 
her wisdom  and they cut off the head 
of sheba the son of bichri  and threw 
it out to joab  and he blew the horn  
and they were dispersed from the city  
every man to his tent  and joab 
returned to jerusalem unto the king   
23now joab was over all the host of 
israel  and benaiah the son of jehoiada 
was over the cherethites and over the 
pelethites  24and adoram was over the 
levy and jehoshaphat the son of 
ahilud was the recorde r 25and sheva 
was scribe  and zadok and abiathar second samuel  
463 
 were priests  26and ira also the jairite 
was chief minister unto david   
and there was a famine in the 
days of david three years  year 
after year  and david sought the face 
of the lord and the lord said it is 
for saul  and for his bloody house  
because he put to death the 
gibeonites  2and the king called the 
gibeonites  and said unto them now 
the gibeonites were not of the children 
of israel  but of the remnant of the 
amorites  and the children of isr ael 
had sworn unto them  and saul sought 
to slay them in his zeal for the children 
of israel and judah  3and david said 
unto the gibeonites  what shall i do 
for you  and wherewith shall i make 
atonement  that ye may bless the 
inheritance of the lord 4and the 
gibeonites said unto him  it is no 
matter of silver or gold between us and 
saul or his house  neither is it for us 
to put any man to death in israel  and 
he said  what say ye that i should do 
for you  5and they said unto the king  
the man that consumed us  and that 
devised against us  so that we have 
been destroyed from remaining in any 
of the borders of israel  6let seven men 
of his sons be delivered unto us  and 
we will hang them up unto the lord in 
gibeah of saul  the chosen of the 
lord and the king said  i will 
deliver them   
7but the king spared mephibosheth  
the son of jonathan the son of saul  
because of the l ords oath that was 
between them  between david and jonathan the son of saul  8but the king 
took the two sons of rizpah the 
daug hter of aiah  whom she bore unto 
saul armoni and mephibosheth  and 
the five sons of michal the daughter of 
saul whom she bore to adriel the son 
of barzillai the meholathite  9and he 
delivered them into the hands of the 
gibeonites  and they hanged them in  
the mountain before the lord and 
they fell all seven together  and they 
were put to death in the days of 
harvest  in the first days  at the 
beginning of barley harvest   
10and rizpah the daughter of aiah 
took sackcloth  and spread it for her 
upon the roc k from the beginning of 
harvest until water was poured upon 
them from heaven  and she suffered 
neither the birds of the air to rest on 
them by day  nor the beasts of the field 
by night  11and it was told david what 
rizpah the daughter of aiah  the 
concubi ne of saul  had done  12and 
david went and took the bones of saul 
and the bones of jonathan his son from 
the men of jabesh gilead  who had 
stolen them from the broad place of 
beth shan where the philistines had 
hanged them  in the day that the 
philistines  slew saul in gilboa  13and 
he brought up from thence the bones 
of saul and the bones of jonathan his 
son and they gathered the bones of 
them that were hanged  14and they 
buried the bones of saul and jonathan 
his son in the country of benjamin in 
zela in the sepulchre of kish his 
father  and they performed all that the 21 second samuel  
464 
 king commanded  and after that god 
was entreated for the land   
15and the philistines had war again 
with israel  and david went down  and 
his servants with him  and fought 
against the phili stines  and david 
waxed faint  16and ishbibenob  who 
was of the sons of the giant  the weight 
of whose spear was three hundred 
shekels of brass in weight  he being 
girded with new armour  thought to 
have slain david  17but abishai the 
son of zeruiah succou red him  and 
smote the philistine  and killed him  
then the men of david swore unto 
him saying  thou shalt go no more 
out with us to battle  that thou quench 
not the lamp of israel   
18and it came to pass after this  that 
there was again war with the 
philistines at gob  then sibbecai the 
hushathite slew saph  who was of the 
sons of the giant  19and there was 
again war with the philistines at gob  
and elhanan the son of jaare oregim 
the beth lehemite slew goliath the 
gittite  the staff of whose spear was 
like a weaver s beam  20and there was 
again war at gath  where was a 
champion  that had on every hand six 
fingers  and on every foot six toes  
four and twenty in number  and he also 
was born to the giant  21and when he 
taunted israel  jonathan the son of 
shimea david s brother slew him  
22these four were born to the giant in 
gath  and they fell by the hand of 
david  and by the hand of his servants   and david spoke unto the 
lord the words of this song in 
the day that the lord delivered him 
out of the han d of all his enemies  and 
out of the hand of saul  2and he said   
the lord is my rock  and my 
fortress  and my deliverer   
3the god who is my rock  in him i 
take refuge   
my shield  and my horn of 
salvation  my high tower  and my 
refuge   
my saviour  thou savest me from 
violence   
4praised  i cry is the lord  
and i am saved from mine enemies  
 
5for the waves of death compassed 
me  
the floods of abelial assailed me   
6the cords of sheol surrounded me   
the snares of death confronted me   
7in my distress i  called upon the 
lord 
yea i called unto my god   
and out of his temple he heard my 
voice   
and my cry did enter into his ears   
8then the earth did shake and 
quake   
the foundations of heaven did 
tremble   
tey were shaken  because he was 
wroth   
9smoke a rose up in his nostrils   
and fire out of his mouth did 
devour   
                                                      
a that is the nether world  22 second samuel  
465 
 coals flamed forth from him   
10he bowed the heavens also  and 
came  down   
and thick darkness was under his 
feet  
11and he rode upon a cherub  and 
did fly   
yea he was seen upon the wings o f 
the wind   
12and he made darkness pavilions 
round about him   
gathering of waters  thick clouds of 
the skies   
13at the brightness before him  
coals of fire flamed forth   
14the lord thundered from heaven   
and the most high gave forth his 
voice   
15and he sent out arrows  and 
scattered them   
lightning  and discomfited them   
16and the channels of the sea 
appeared   
the foundations of the world were 
laid bare  
by the rebuke of the lord  
at the blast of the breath of his 
nostrils   
 
17he sent from on hig h he took me   
he drew me out of many waters   
18he delivered me from mine enemy 
most strong   
from them that hated me  for they 
were too mighty for me   
19they confronted me in the day of 
my calamity   
but the lord was a stay unto me   20he brought me fo rth also into a 
large place   
he delivered me  because he 
delighted in me   
21the lord rewarded me according 
to my righteousness   
according to the cleanness of my 
hands hath he recompensed me   
 
22for i have kept the ways of the 
lord  
and have not wicked ly departed 
from my god   
23for all his ordinances were before 
me  
and as for his statutes  i did not 
depart from them   
24and i was single hearted toward 
him  
and i kept myself from mine 
iniquity   
25therefore hath the lord 
recompensed me according to m y 
righteousness   
according to my cleanness in his 
eyes  
 
26with the merciful thou dost show  
thyself merciful   
with the upright man thou dost 
show  
thyself upright   
27with the pure thou dost show 
thyself  pure  
and with the crooked thou dost 
show  
thys elf subtle   
28and the afflicted people thou dost 
save  second samuel  
466 
 but thine eyes are upon the 
haughty  that thou mayest 
humble them   
 
29for thou art my lamp  o lord  
and the lord doth lighten my 
darkness   
30for by thee i run upon a troop   
by my god do i scale a  wall  
31as for god  his way is perfect   
the word of the lord is tried   
he is a shield unto all them that take 
refuge in him   
 
32for who is god  save the lord  
and who is a rock  save our god   
33the god who is my strong 
fortress   
and who letteth my way go forth 
straight   
34who maketh my feet like hinds   
and setteth me upon my high 
places   
35who traineth my hands for war   
so that mine arms do bend a bow of 
brass   
36thou hast also given me thy 
shield of salvation   
and thy condescension hath made  
me great   
37thou hast enlarged my steps under 
me  
and my feet have not slipped   
 
38i have pursued mine enemies  and  
 destroyed them   
neither did i turn back till they were 
consumed   39and i have consumed them  and 
smitten them through  that they 
cannot arise   
yea they are fallen under my feet   
40for thou hast girded me with 
strength unto the battle   
thou hast subdued under me those 
that rose up against me   
41thou hast also made mine enemies 
turn their backs unto me   
yea them that hate me  that i might 
cut them off   
42they looked  but there was none to 
save  
even unto the lord but he 
answered them not   
43then did i beat them small as the 
dust of the earth   
i did stamp them as the mire of the 
streets  and did tread them down   
44thou also ha st delivered me from 
the contentions of my people   
thou hast kept me to be the head of 
the nations   
a people whom i have not known 
serve me   
45the sons of the stranger dwindle 
away before me   
as soon as they hear of me  they 
obey me   
46the sons of the  stranger fade 
away   
and come halting out of their close 
places   
 
47the lord liveth  and blessed be 
my rock   
and exalted be the god  my rock of 
salvation   second samuel  
467 
 48even the god that executeth 
vengeance for me   
and bringeth down peoples under 
me  
49and that bringeth me forth from 
mine enemies   
yea thou liftest me up above them 
that rise up against me   
thou deliverest me from the violent 
man  
50therefore i will give thanks unto 
thee  o lord among the nations   
and will sing praises unto thy 
name   
51a tow er of salvation is he to his 
king  
and showeth mercy to his anointed   
to david and to his seed  for 
evermore   
 
now these are the last words 
of   david   
the saying of david the son of 
jesse   
and the saying of the man raised on 
high  
the anointed of  the god of jacob   
and the sweet singer of israel   
2the spirit of the lord spoke by me   
and his word was upon my tongue   
 
3the god of israel said   
the rock of israel spoke to me   
ruler over men shall be  
the righteous  even he that ruleth in 
the fea r of god   
4and as the light of the morning  
when the sun riseth   
a morning without clouds   when through clear shining after 
rain  
the tender grass springeth out of the 
earth   
5for is not my house established 
with god   
for an everlasting covenant he hath 
made with me   
ordered in all things  and sure   
for all my salvation  and all my 
desire   
will he not make it to grow   
6but the ungodly  they are as thorns 
thrust away  all of them   
for they cannot be taken with the 
hand   
7but the man that touchet h them  
must be armed with iron and the 
staff of a spear   
and they shall be utterly burned 
with fire in their place   
 
8these are the names of the mighty 
men whom david had  josheb 
basshebeth a tahchemonite  chief of 
the captains  the same was adino the 
eznite  he lifted up his spear  against 
eight hundred  whom he slew at one 
time  
9and after him was eleazar the son 
of dodo the son of an ahohite  one of 
the three mighty men with david  
when they jeoparded their lives against 
the philistines that were th ere gathered 
together to battle  and the men of 
israel were gone away  10he stood 
firm and smote the philistines until his 
hand was weary  and his hand did 
cleave unto the sword  and the lord 23 second samuel  
468 
 wrought a great victory that day  and 
the people returned after  him only to 
strip the slain   
11and after him was shammah the 
son of age the ararite  and the 
philistines were gathered together into 
a troop  where was a plot of ground 
full of lentils  and the people fled from 
the philistines  12but he stood in the 
mids t of the plot  and defended it  and 
slew the philistines  and the lord 
wrought a great victory   
13and three of the thirty chief went 
down  and came to david in the 
harvest time unto the cave of adullam  
and the troop of the philistines were 
encamped in th e valley of rephaim  
14and david was then in the 
stronghold  and the garrison of the 
philistines was then in beth lehem  
15and david longed  and said  oh that 
one would give me water to drink of 
the well of beth lehem  which is by 
the gate   16and the th ree mighty men 
broke through the host of the 
philistines  and drew water out of the 
well of beth lehem  that was by the 
gate and took it  and brought it to 
david  but he would not drink thereof  
but poured it out unto the lord 17and 
he said  be it far f rom me  o lord 
that i should do this  shall i drink the 
blood of the men that went in jeopardy 
of their lives  therefore he would not 
drink it  these things did the three 
mighty men   
18and abishai  the brother of joab  
the son of zeruiah  was chief of t he 
three  and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them  
and had a name among the three  19he 
was most honourable of the three  
therefore he was made their captain  
howbeit he attained not unto the first 
three   
20and benaiah the son of je hoiada  
the son of a valiant man of kabzeel  
who had done mighty deeds  he smote 
the two altar hearths of moab  he went 
down also and slew a lion in the midst 
of a pit in time of snow  21and he slew 
an egyptian  a goodly man  and the 
egyptian had a spear i n his hand  but 
he went down to him with a staff  and 
plucked the spear out of the egyptian s 
hand  and slew him with his own 
spear  22these things did benaiah the 
son of jehoiada  and had a name 
among the three mighty men  23he was 
more honourable than th e thirty  but he 
attained not to the first three  and 
david set him over his guard

seven in all   
and again the anger of the 
lord was kindled against 
israel  and he moved david against 
them  saying  go number israel and 
judah  2and the king said to joab the 
captain of the host that was with him  
go now to and fro through all the 
tribes of israel  from dan even to 
beer sheba  and number ye the people  
that i may know the sum of the 
people  3and joab said unto the king  
now the lord thy god add unto the 
people  how many soever they may be  
a hundred fold and may the eyes of my 
lord the king see it  but why doth my 
lord the king delight in this thing  
4notwithstanding the king s word 
prevailed against joab  and against the 
captains of the host  and joab and the 
captains of the host went out from the 
presence of the king  to number the 
people of israel  5and they passed over 
the jordan  and pitched in aroer  on 
the right side of the city that is in the 
middle of the valley of gad  and unto 
jazer  6then they came to gilead  and 
to the land of tahtim hodshi and they came to dan jaan and round about to 
zidon  7and came to the stronghold of 
tyre  and to all the cities of the 
hivites  and of the canaanites  and 
they went out to the south of judah  at 
beer sheba  8so when they had gone to 
and fro through al l the land  they came 
to jerusalem at the end of nine months 
and twenty days  9and joab gave up 
the sum of the numbering of the 
people unto the king  and there were in 
israel eight hundred thousand valiant 
men that drew the sword  and the men 
of judah were  five hundred thousand 
men  
10and david s heart smote him after 
that he had numbered the people  and 
david said unto the lord i have 
sinned greatly in what i have done  but 
now o lord put away  i beseech 
thee  the iniquity of thy servant  for i 
have d one very foolishly  11and when 
david rose up in the morning  the 
word of the lord came unto the 
prophet gad  david s seer  saying  
12go and speak unto david  thus 
saith the lord i lay upon thee three 
things  choose thee one of them  that i 
may do it unt o thee  13so gad came to 
david  and told him  and said unto 
him shall seven years of famine 
come unto thee in thy land  or wilt 
thou flee three months before thy foes 
while they pursue thee  or shall there 
be three days pestilence in thy land  
now advis e thee  and consider what 
answer i shall return to him that sent 
me 14and david said unto gad  i am 
in a great strait  let us fall now into the 24 second samuel  
470 
 hand of the lord for his mercies are 
great  and let me not fall into the hand 
of man   
15so the lord sent a  pestilence upon 
israel from the morning even to the 
time appointed  and there died of the 
people from dan even to beer sheba 
seventy thousand men  16and when the 
angel stretched out his hand toward 
jerusalem to destroy it  the lord 
repented him of the evi l and said to 
the angel that destroyed the people  it 
is enough  now stay thy hand  and 
the angel of the lord was by the 
threshing floor of araunah the 
jebusite  17and david spoke unto the 
lord when he saw the angel that 
smote the people  and said  lo i have 
sinned  and i have done iniquitously  
but these sheep  what have they done  
let thy hand  i pray thee  be against 
me and against my father s house   
18and gad came that day to david  
and said unto him  go up  rear an 
altar unto the lord in the t hreshing 
floor of araunah the jebusite  19and 
david went up according to the saying 
of gad  as the lord commanded  
20and araunah looked forth  and saw 
the king and his servants coming on toward him  and araunah went out  
and bowed down before the king wit h 
his face to the ground  21and araunah 
said wherefore is my lord the king 
come to his servant  and david said  
to buy the threshing floor of thee  to 
build an altar unto the lord that the 
plague may be stayed from the 
people  22and araunah said unto  
david  let my lord the king take and 
offer up what seemeth good unto him  
behold the oxen for the burnt offering  
and the threshing instruments and the 
furniture of the oxen for the wood  
23all this did araunah the king give 
unto the king  and araunah s aid unto 
the king  the lord thy god accept 
thee 24and the king said unto 
araunah  nay but i will verily buy it 
of thee at a price  neither will i offer 
burnt offerings unto the lord my god 
which cost me nothing  so david 
bought the threshing floor an d the 
oxen for fifty shekels of silver  25and 
david built there an altar unto the 
lord and offered burnt offerings and 
peace offerings  so the lord was 
entreated for the land  and the plague 
was stayed from israel    
471 
    
first kings  
 
now king davi d was old and 
stricken in years  and they 
covered him with clothes  but he could 
get no heat  2wherefore his servants 
said unto him  let there be sought for 
my lord the king a young virgin  and 
let her stand before the king  and be a 
companion unto him  and let her lie in 
thy bosom  that my lord the king may 
get heat  3so they sought for a fair 
damsel throughout all the borders of 
israel  and found abishag the 
shunammite  and brought her to the 
king 4and the damsel was very fair  
and she became a compani on unto the 
king and ministered to him  but the 
king knew her not   
5now adonijah the son of haggith 
exalted himself  saying  i will be 
king and he prepared him chariots 
and horsemen  and fifty men to run 
before him  6and his father had not 
grieved him  all his life in saying  
why hast thou done so  and he was 
also a very goodly man  and he was 
born after absalom  7and he conferred 
with joab the son of zeruiah  and with 
abiathar the priest  and they following 
adonijah helped him  8but zadok the 
priest  and benaiah the son of 
jehoiada  and nathan the prophet  and 
shimei  and rei  and the mighty men 
that belonged to david  were not with 
adonijah  9and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of 
zoheleth  which is beside en rogel  
and he call ed all his brethren the 
kings sons  and all the men of judah 
the king s servants  10but nathan the 
prophet  and benaiah  and the mighty 
men and solomon his brother  he 
called not   
11then nathan spoke unto bath 
sheba the mother of solomon  saying  
hast thou not heard that adonijah the 
son of haggith doth reign  and david 
our lord knoweth it not  12now 
therefore come  let me  i pray thee  
give thee counsel  that thou mayest 
save thine own life  and the life of thy 
son solomon  13go and get thee in 
unto ki ng david  and say unto him  
didst not thou  my lord  o king  swear 
unto thy handmaid  saying  assuredly 
solomon thy son shall reign after me  
and he shall sit upon my throne  why 
then doth adonijah reign  14behold  
while thou yet talkest there with the 
king i also will come in after thee  and 
confirm thy words   
15and bath sheba went in unto the 
king into the chamber now the king 
was very old  and abishag the 
shunammite ministered unto the 
king16and bath sheba bowed  and 
prostrated herself unto the kin g and 
the king said  what wouldest thou  
17and she said unto him  my lord  1 first kings  
472 
 thou didst swear by the lord thy god 
unto thy handmaid  assuredly 
solomon thy son shall reign after me  
and he shall sit upon my throne  18and 
now behold  adonijah reigneth  and 
thou my lord the king  knowest it not  
19and he hath slain oxen and fatlings 
and sheep in abundance  and hath 
called all the sons of the king  and 
abiathar  the priest  and joab the 
captain of the host  but solomon thy 
servant hath he not called  20and thou 
my lord the king  the eyes of all israel 
are upon thee  that thou shouldest tell 
them who shall sit on the throne of my 
lord the king after him  21otherwise it 
will come to pass  when my lord the 
king shall sleep with his fathers  that i 
and my son s olomon shall be counted 
offenders   
22and lo while she yet talked with 
the king  nathan the prophet came in  
23and they told the king  saying  
behold nathan the prophet  and 
when he was come in before the king  
he bowed down before the king with 
his f ace to the ground  24and nathan 
said my lord  o king  hast thou said  
adonijah shall reign after me  and he 
shall sit upon my throne  25for he is 
gone down this day  and hath slain 
oxen and fatlings and sheep in 
abundance  and hath called all the 
kings sons and the captains of the 
host and abiathar the priest  and 
behold  they eat and drink before him  
and say  long live king adonijah  
26but me  even me thy servant  and 
zadok the priest  and benaiah the son of jehoiada  and thy servant solomon 
hath he  not called  27is this thing done 
by my lord the king  and thou hast not 
declared unto thy servant who should 
sit on the throne of my lord the king 
after him   
28then king david answered and 
said call me bath sheba  and she 
came into the king s presenc e and 
stood before the king  29and the king 
swore and said  as the lord liveth  
who hath redeemed my soul out of all 
adversity  30verily as i swore unto thee 
by the lord the god of israel  saying  
assuredly solomon thy son shall reign 
after me  and he s hall sit upon my 
throne in my stead  verily so will i do 
this day  31then bath sheba bowed 
with her face to the earth  and 
prostrated herself to the king  and said  
let my lord king david live for ever   
32and king david said  call me 
zadok the priest  and nathan the 
prophet  and benaiah the son of 
jehoiada  and they came before the 
king 33and the king said unto them  
take with you the servants of your 
lord and cause solomon my son to 
ride upon mine own mule  and bring 
him down to gihon  34and let z adok 
the priest and nathan the prophet 
anoint him there king over israel  and 
blow ye with the horn  and say  long 
live king solomon  35then ye shall 
come up after him  and he shall come 
and sit upon my throne  for he shall be 
king in my stead  and i have appointed 
him to be prince over israel and over 
judah  36and benaiah the son of first kings  
473 
 jehoiada answered the king  and said  
amen  so say the lord the god of 
my lord the king  37as the lord hath 
been with my lord the king  even so be 
he with solomon  and make his throne 
greater than the throne of my lord king 
david   
38so zadok the priest  and nathan 
the prophet  and benaiah the son of 
jehoiada  and the cherethites and the 
pelethites  went down  and caused 
solomon to ride upon king david s 
mule  and brought hi m to gihon  
39and zadok the priest took the horn 
of oil out of the tent  and anointed 
solomon  and they blew the ram s 
horn and all the people said  long 
live king solomon  40and all the 
people came up after him  and the 
people piped with pipes  and rej oiced 
with great joy  so that the earth rent 
with the sound of them   
41and adonijah and all the guests 
that were with him heard it as they had 
made an end of eating  and when joab 
heard the sound of the horn  he said  
wherefore is this noise of the city 
being in an uproar  42while he yet 
spoke  behold  jonathan the son of 
abiathar the priest came  and 
adonijah said  come in  for thou art a 
worthy man  and bringest good 
tidings  43and jonathan answered and 
said to adonijah  verily our lord king 
david h ath made solomon king  44and 
the king hath sent with him zadok the 
priest  and nathan the prophet  and 
benaiah the son of jehoiada  and the 
cherethites and the pelethites  and they have caused him to ride upon the 
kings mule  45and zadok the priest 
and na than the prophet have anointed 
him king in gihon  and they are come 
up from thence rejoicing  so that the 
city is in an uproar  this is the noise 
that ye have heard  46and also 
solomon sitteth on the throne of the 
kingdom  47and moreover the king s 
servant s came to bless our lord king 
david  saying  god make the name of 
solomon better than thy name  and 
make his throne greater than thy 
throne  and the king bowed down upon 
the bed  48and also thus said the king  
blessed be the lord the god of israel  
who ha th given one to sit on my throne 
this day  mine eyes even seeing it   
49and all the guests of adonijah 
were afraid  and rose up  and went 
every man his way  50and adonijah 
feared because of solomon  and he 
arose  and went  and caught hold on 
the horns of the altar  51and it was told 
solomon  saying  behold  adonijah 
feareth king solomon  for lo he hath 
laid hold on the horns of the altar  
saying  let king solomon swear unto 
me first of all that he will not slay his 
servant with the sword  52and 
solomon  said if he shall show 
himself a worthy man  there shall not a 
hair of him fall to the earth  but if 
wickedness be found in him  he shall 
die 53so king solomon sent  and they 
brought him down from the altar  and 
he came and prostrated himself before 
king solomon  and solomon said unto 
him go to thy house   first kings  
474 
 now the days of david drew nigh 
that he should die  and he charged 
solomon his son  saying  2i go the 
way of all the earth  be thou strong 
therefore  and show thyself a man  
3and keep the charge  of the lord thy 
god to walk in his ways  to keep his 
statutes  and his commandments  and 
his ordinances  and his testimonies  
according to that which is written in 
the law of moses  that thou mayest 
prosper in all that thou doest  and 
whithersoever thou turnest thyself  
4that the lord may establish his word 
which he spoke concerning me  
saying  if thy children take heed to 
their way  to walk before me in truth 
with all their heart and with all their 
soul there shall not fail thee  said he  
a man on the t hrone of israel  
5moreover thou knowest also what 
joab the son of zeruiah did unto me  
even what he did to the two captains of 
the hosts of israel  unto abner the son 
of ner and unto amasa the son of 
jether  whom he slew  and shed the 
blood of war in peace  and put the 
blood of war upon his girdle that was 
about his loins  and in his shoes that 
were on his feet  6do therefore 
according to thy wisdom  and let not 
his hoar head go down to the grave in 
peace  7but show kindness unto the 
sons of barzillai the g ileadite  and let 
them be of those that eat at thy table  
for so they drew nigh unto me when i 
fled from absalom thy brother  8and 
behold  there is with thee shimei the 
son of gera  the benjamite  of bahurim  who cursed me with a 
grievous curse in the day  when i went 
to mahanaim  but he came down to 
meet me at the jordan  and i swore to 
him by the lord saying  i will not put 
thee to death with the sword  9now 
therefore hold him not guiltless  for 
thou art a wise man  and thou wilt 
know what thou oughtest to do unto 
him and thou shalt bring his hoar head 
down to the grave with blood   
10and david slept with his fathers  
and was buried in the city of david  
11and the days that david reigned over 
israel were forty years  seven years 
reigned he in hebron  and thirty and 
three years reigned he in jerusalem  
12and solomon sat upon the throne of 
david his father  and his kingdom was 
established firmly   
13then adonijah the son of haggith 
came to bath sheba the mother of 
solomon  and she said  comest thou 
peacea bly and he said  peaceably  
14he said moreover  i have somewhat 
to say unto thee  and she said  say 
on 15and he said  thou knowest that 
the kingdom was mine  and that all 
israel set their faces on me  that i 
should reign  howbeit the kingdom is 
turned about  and is become my 
brother s for it was his from the lord 
16and now i ask one petition of thee  
deny me not  and she said unto him  
say on  17and he said  speak  i pray 
thee unto solomon the king for he 
will not say thee nay that he give me 
abishag the shunammite to wife  2 first kings  
475 
 18and bath sheba said  well  i will 
speak for thee unto the king   
19bath sheba therefore went unto 
king solomon  to speak unto him for 
adonijah  and the king rose up to 
meet her  and bowed down unto her  
and sat down on his throne  and caused 
a throne to be set for the king s 
mother  and she sat on his right hand  
20then she said  i ask one small 
petition of thee  deny me not  and the 
king said unto her  ask on  my 
mother  for i will not deny thee  
21and she said  let abishag the 
shunammite be given to adonijah thy 
brother to wife  22and king solomon 
answered and said unto his mother  
and why dost thou ask abishag the 
shunammite for adonijah  ask for him 
the kingdom also  for he is mine elder 
brother  even for hi m and for abiathar 
the priest  and for joab the son of 
zeruiah  23then king solomon swore 
by the lord saying  god do so to me  
and more also  if adonijah have not 
spoken this word against his own life  
24now therefore as the lord liveth  
who hath estab lished me  and set me 
on the throne of david my father  and 
who hath made me a house  as he 
promised  surely adonijah shall be put 
to death this day  25and king solomon 
sent by the hand of benaiah the son of 
jehoiada  and he fell upon him  so that 
he died   
26and unto abiathar the priest said 
the king  get thee to anathoth  unto 
thine own fields  for thou art deserving 
of death  but i will not at this time put thee to death  because thou didst bear 
the ark of the lord g od before david 
my father  and becau se thou wast 
afflicted in all wherein my father was 
afflicted  27so solomon thrust out 
abiathar from being priest unto the 
lord that the word of the lord might 
be fulfilled  which he spoke 
concerning the house of eli in shiloh   
28and the tidings came to  joab for 
joab had turned after adonijah  though 
he turned not after absalom  and joab 
fled unto the tent of the lord and 
caught hold on the horns of the altar  
29and it was told king solomon  joab 
is fled unto the tent of the lord and 
behold  he is b y the altar  then 
solomon sent benaiah the son of 
jehoiada  saying  go fall upon him  
30and benaiah came to the tent of the 
lord and said unto him  thus saith 
the king  come forth  and he said  
nay but i will die here  and 
benaiah brought back wo rd unto the 
king saying  thus said joab  and thus 
he answered me  31and the king said 
unto him  do as he hath said  and fall 
upon him  and bury him  that thou 
mayest take away the blood  which 
joab shed without cause  from me and 
from my father s house  32and the 
lord will return his blood upon his 
own head  because he fell upon two 
men more righteous and better than he  
and slew them with the sword  and my 
father david knew it not  abner the 
son of ner  captain of the host of 
israel  and amasa the son of jether  
captain of the host of judah  33so shall first kings  
476 
 their blood return upon the head of 
joab and upon the head of his seed for 
ever but unto david  and unto his 
seed and unto his house  and unto his 
throne  shall there be peace for ever 
from the lord 34then benaiah the 
son of jehoiada went up  and fell upon 
him and slew him  and he was buried 
in his own house in the wilderness  
35and the king put benaiah the son of 
jehoiada in his room over the host  and 
zadok the priest did the king put in the 
room o f abiathar   
36and the king sent and called for 
shimei  and said unto him  build thee 
a house in jerusalem  and dwell there  
and go not forth thence any whither  
37for on the day thou goest out  and 
passest over the brook kidron  know 
thou for certain that  thou shalt surely 
die thy blood shall be upon thine own 
head  38and shimei said unto the 
king the saying is good  as my lord 
the king hath said  so will thy servant 
do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem 
many days   
39and it came to pass at the end of 
three years  that two of the servants of 
shimei ran away unto achish  son of 
maacah  king of gath  and they told 
shimei  saying  behold  thy servants 
are in gath  40and shimei arose  and 
saddled his ass  and went to gath to 
achish  to seek his servants  and 
shimei went  and brought his servants 
from gath  41and it was told solomon 
that shimei had gone from jerusalem 
to gath  and was come back  42and the 
king sent and called for shimei  and said unto him  did i not make thee to 
swear by the lord and forewar ned 
thee saying  know for certain  that on 
the day thou goest out  and walkest 
abroad any whither  thou shalt surely 
die and thou saidst unto me  the 
saying is good  i have heard it  43why 
then hast thou not kept the oath of the 
lord and the commandment  that i 
have charged thee with  44the king 
said moreover to shimei  thou 
knowest all the wickedness which thy 
heart is privy to  that thou didst to 
david my father  therefore the lord 
shall return thy wickedness upon thine 
own head  45but king solomon sh all be 
blessed  and the throne of david shall 
be established before the lord for 
ever 46so the king commanded 
benaiah the son of jehoiada  and he 
went out  and fell upon him  so that he 
died  
and the kingdom was established in  
the hand of solomon  1and 
solomon became allied to 
pharaoh king of egypt by marriage  
and took pharaoh s daughter  and 
brought her into the city of david  
until he had made an end of building 
his own house  and the house of the 
lord and the wall of jerusalem round 
about  2only the people sacrificed in 
the high places  because there was no 
house built for the name of the lord 
until those days  3and solomon loved 
the lord walking in the statutes of 
david his father  only he sacrificed 
and offered in the high places   3 first kings  
477 
 4and the kin g went to gibeon to 
sacrifice there  for that was the great 
high place  a thousand burnt offerings 
did solomon offer upon that altar  5in 
gibeon the lord appeared to solomon 
in a dream by night  and god said  
ask what i shall give thee  6and 
solomon said  thou hast shown unto 
thy servant david my father great 
kindness  according as he walked 
before thee in truth  and in 
righteousness  and in uprightness of 
heart with thee  and thou hast kept 
for him this great kindness  that thou 
hast given him a son to sit on his 
throne  as it is this day  7and now  o 
lord my god  thou hast made thy 
servant king instead of david my 
father  and i am but a little child  i 
know not how to go out or come in  
8and thy servant is in the midst of 
thy people which thou hast chos en a 
great people  that cannot be numbered 
nor counted for multitude  9give thy 
servant therefore an understanding 
heart to judge thy people  that i may 
discern between good and evil  for 
who is able to judge this thy great 
people  10and the speech pleas ed the 
lord that solomon had asked this 
thing  11and god said unto him  
because thou hast asked this thing  
and hast not asked for thyself long life  
neither hast asked riches for thyself  
nor hast asked the life of thine 
enemies  but hast asked for thys elf 
understanding to discern justice  
12behold  i have done according to thy 
word  lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart  so that there 
hath been none like thee before thee  
neither after thee shall any arise like 
unto thee  13and i have also given thee 
that which thou hast not asked  both 
riches and honour so that there hath 
not been any among the kings like 
unto thee all thy days  14and if thou 
wilt walk in my ways  to keep my 
statutes and my commandments  as 
thy father david did walk  then i will 
lengthen thy days  15and solomon 
awoke  and behold  it was a dream  
and he came to jerusalem  and stood 
before the ark of the covenant of the 
lord and offered up burnt offerings  
and offered peace offerings  and made 
a feast to all his servan ts  
16then came there two women  that 
were harlots  unto the king  and stood 
before him  17and the one woman 
said oh my lord  i and this woman 
dwell in one house  and i was 
delivered of a child with her in the 
house  18and it came to pass the third 
day after i was delivered  that this 
woman was delivered also  and we 
were together  there was no stranger 
with us in the house  save we two in 
the house  19and this woman s child 
died in the night  because she overlay 
it 20and she arose at midnight  and 
took my son from beside me  while thy 
handmaid slept  and laid it in her 
bosom  and laid her dead child in my 
bosom  21and when i rose in the 
morning to give my child suck  
behold  it was dead  but when i had 
looked well at it in the morning  first kings  
478 
 behold  it was n ot my son  whom i did 
bear 22and the other woman said  
nay but the living is my son  and the 
dead is thy son  and this said  no 
but the dead is thy son  and the living 
is my son  thus they spoke before the 
king  
23then said the king  the one sait h 
this is my son that liveth  and thy son 
is the dead  and the other saith  nay 
but thy son is the dead  and my son is 
the living  24and the king said  fetch 
me a sword  and they brought a 
sword before the king  25and the king 
said divide the living  child in two  
and give half to the one  and half to the 
other  26then spoke the woman whose 
the living child was unto the king  for 
her heart yearned upon her son  and 
she said  oh my lord  give her the 
living child  and in no wise slay it  
but the ot her said  it shall be neither 
mine nor thine  divide it  27then the 
king answered and said  give her the 
living child  and in no wise slay it  she 
is the mother thereof  28and all israel 
heard of the judgment which the king 
had judged  and they feared the king  
for they saw that the wisdom of god 
was in him  to do justice   
and king solomon was king over 
all israel  2and these were the 
princes whom he had  azariah the son 
of zadok  the priest  3elihoreph and 
ahijah  the sons of shisha  scribes  
jehosh aphat the son of ahilud  the 
recorder  4and benaiah the son of 
jehoiada was over the host  and zadok 
and abiathar were priests  5and azariah the son of nathan was over 
the officers  and zabud the son of 
nathan was chief minister and the 
kings friend  6and ahishar was over 
the household  and adoniram the son 
of abda was over the levy   
7and solomon had twelve officers 
over all israel  who provided victuals 
for the king and his household  each 
man had to make provision for a 
month in the year  8and these are  their 
names  the son of hur  in the hill 
country of ephraim  9the son of deker  
in makaz  and in shaalbim  and beth 
shemesh  and elon bethhanan  10the 
son of hesed  in arubboth  to him 
pertained socoh  and all the land of 
hepher  11the son of abinadab  in all

daughter of solomon to wife  12baana 
the son of ahilud  in taanach and

beside zarethan  beneath jezreel  from 
beth shean to abel meholah  as far as 
beyond jokmeam  13the son o f geber  
in ramoth gilead  to him pertained the 
villages of jair the son of manasseh  
which are in gilead  even to him 
pertained the region of argob  which 
is in bashan  threescore great cities 
with walls and brazen bars  
14ahinadab the son of iddo  in 
mahanaim  15ahimaaz  in naphtali  he 
also took basemath the daughter of 
solomon to wife  16baana the son of 
hushai  in asher and bealoth  
17jehoshaphat the son of paruah  in 
issachar  18shimei the son of ela  in 
benjamin  19geber the son of uri  in 4 first kings  
479 
 the land o f gilead  the country of 
sihon king of the amorites and of og 
king of bashan  and one officer that 
was over all the officers  in the land  
20judah and israel were many  as the 
sand which is by the sea in multitude  
eating and drinking and making merry  
and solomon ruled over all the 
kingdoms from the river unto the 
land of the philistines  and unto the 
border of egypt  they brought 
presents  and served solomon all the 
days of his life   
2and solomon s provision for one 
day was thirty measures of fine flo ur 
and threescore measures of meal  3ten 
fat oxen  and twenty oxen out of the 
pastures  and a hundred sheep  beside 
harts  and gazelles  and roebucks  and 
fatted fowl  4for he had dominion over 
all the region on this side the river  
from tiphsah even to g aza over all 
the kings on this side the river  and he 
had peace on all sides round about 
him 2and judah and israel dwelt 
safely  every man under his vine and 
under his fig tree from dan even to 
beer sheba  all the days of solomon   
6and solomon had fort y thousand 
stalls of horses for his chariots  and 
twelve thousand horsemen  2and those 
officers provided victual for king 
solomon  and for all that came unto 
king solomon s table  every man in his 
month  they let nothing be lacking  
8barley also and straw for the horses 
and swift steeds brought they unto the 
place where it should be  every man 
according to his charge   9and god gave solomon wisdom 
and understanding exceeding much  
and largeness of heart  even as the 
sand that is on the sea shore  10and 
solomons wisdom excelled the 
wisdom of all the children of the east  
and all the wisdom of egypt  11for he 
was wiser than all men  than ethan the 
ezrahite  and heman  and calcol  and 
darda  the sons of mahol  and his 
fame was in all the nations round 
about  12and he spoke three thousand 
proverbs  and his songs were a 
thousand and five  13and he spoke of 
trees  from the cedar that is in lebanon 
even unto the hyssop that springeth out 
of the wall  he spoke also of beasts  
and of fowl  and of creeping things  
and of fishes  14and there came of all 
peoples to hear the wisdom of 
solomon  from all kings of the earth  
who had heard of his wisdom   
15and hiram king of tyre sent his 
servants unto solomon  for he had 
heard that they had anointed him king 
in the room of h is father  for hiram 
was ever a lover of david  16and 
solomon sent to hiram  saying  
17thou knowest how that david my 
father could not build a house for the 
name of the lord his god for the wars 
which were about him on every side  
until the lord put them under the soles 
of my feet  18but now the lord my 
god hath given me rest on every side  
there is neither adversary  nor evil 
occurrence  19and behold  i purpose 
to build a house for the name of the 
lord my god  as the lord spoke unto 5 first kings  
480 
 david my father  saying thy son  
whom i will set upon thy throne in thy 
room  he shall build the house for my 
name  20now therefore command thou 
that they hew me cedar trees out of 
lebanon  and my servants shall be 
with thy servants  and i will give thee 
hire for thy servants  according to all 
that thou shalt say  for thou knowest 
that there is not among us any that 
hath skill to hew timber like unto the 
zidonians   
21and it came to pass  when hiram 
heard the words of solomon  that he 
rejoiced greatly  and said  blessed be 
the lord this day  who hath given unto 
david a wise son over this great 
people  22and hiram sent to solomon  
saying  i have heard that which thou 
hast sent unto me  i will do all thy 
desire concerning timber of cedar  and 
concerning timber of cypress  23my 
servants shall bring them down from 
lebanon unto the sea  and i will make 
them into rafts to go by sea unto the 
place that thou shalt appoint me  and 
will cause them to be broken up there  
and thou shalt receive them  and thou 
shalt accomplish my desire  in giving 
food for my household  24so ahiram 
gave solomon timber of cedar and 
timber of cypress according to all his 
desire  25and solomon gave hiram 
twenty thousand measures of wheat for 
food to his household  and twenty 
measures of beaten oil  thus gave  
solomon to hiram year by year  26and 
                                                      
a heb hirom  and in verse 32  the lord gave solomon wisdom  as he 
promised him  and there was peace 
between hiram and solomon  and they 
two made a league together   
27and king solomon raised a levy 
out of all israel  and the levy was 
thirty thousan d men  28and he sent 
them to lebanon  ten thousand a 
month by courses  a month they were 
in lebanon  and two months at home  
and adoniram was over the levy  
29and solomon had threescore and ten 
thousand that bore burdens  and 
fourscore thousand that were h ewers in 
the mountains  30besides solomon s 
chief officers that were over the work  
three thousand and three hundred  who 
bore rule over the people that wrought 
in the work  31and the king 
commanded  and they quarried great 
stones  costly stones  to lay th e 
foundation of the house with hewn 
stone  32and solomon s builders and 
hiram s builders and the gebalites did 
fashion them  and prepared the timber 
and the stones to build the house   
and it came to pass in the four 
hundred and eightieth year after 
the children of israel were come out of 
the land of egypt  in the fourth year of 
solomon s reign over israel  in the 
month ziv  which is the second month  
that he began to build the house of the 
lord 2and the house which king 
solomon built for the lord the length 
thereof was threescore cubits  and the 
breadth thereof twenty cubits  and the 
height thereof thirty cubits  3and the 6 first kings  
481 
 porch before the atemple of the house  
twenty cubits was the length thereof  
according to the breadth of the house  
and ten cubits wa s the breadth thereof 
before the house  4and for the house 
he made windows broad within  and 
narrow without  5and against the wall 
of the house he built a side structure 
round about  against the walls of the 
house round about  both of the temple 
and of bthe sanctuary  and he made 
sidechambers round about  6the 
nethermost story of the side structure 
was five cubits broad  and the middle 
was six cubits broad  and the third was 
seven cubits broad  for on the outside 
he made rebatements in the wall of the 
hous e round about  that the beams 
should not have hold in the walls of 
the house  7for the house  when it 
was in building  was built of stone 
made ready at the quarry  and there 
was neither hammer nor axe nor any 
tool of iron heard in the house  while it 
was in building  8the door for the 
clowest row of chambers was in the 
right side of the house and they went 
up by winding stairs into the middle 
row and out of the middle into the 
third  9so he built the house  and 
finished it  and he covered in the house 
with planks of cedar over beams  
10and he built the stories of the side 
structure against all the house  each

walk in my statutes  and execute mine 
ordinances  and keep all my 
commandments to walk in them  then 
will i establish my word with thee  
which i spoke unto david thy father  
13in that i will dwell therein among the 
children  of israel  and will not forsake 
my people israel   
14so solomon built the house  and 
finished it  15and he built the walls of

joists of the ceiling  he covered them 
on the inside  with wood  and he 
covered the floor of the house with

overlaid with gold  until all the house 
was finished  also the whole altar that 
belonged to the sanctuary he overlaid

stretched forth  so that the wing of the 
one touched the one wall  and the wing 
of the other cherub touched the other 
wall and their wings touched one 
another in the midst of the house

rows  and light was over against light 
in three ranks  5and all the doors with 
their posts were square in the frame  
and light was over against light in

6and he made the porch of pillars  
the length thereof  was fifty cubits  and 
the breadth thereof thirty cubits  and a 
porch before them  and pillars and 
thick beams before them   
7and he made the porch of the 
throne where he might judge  even the 
porch of judgment  and it was covered 
with cedar from floor to floor   
8and his house where he might 
dwell  in the other court  within the 
porch  was of the like work  he made 
also a house for pharaoh s daughter  
whom solomon had taken to wife  like 
unto this porch   
9all these were of costly stones  
according to the measures of hewn 
stones  sawed with saws  within and

the son of a widow of the tribe of 
naphtali  and his father was a man of 
tyre  a worker in brass  and he was 
filled with wisdom and understanding 
and skill  to work all works in br ass 
and he came to king solomon  and 
wrought all his work   
15thus he fashioned the two pillars 
of brass  of eighteen cubits high each  
and a line of twelve cubits did 
compass it about  and so  the other 
pillar  16and he made two capitals of 
molten brass  to set upon the tops of 
the pillars  the height of the one capital 
was five cubits  and the height of the 
other capital was five cubits  17he also 
made nets of checker work  and 
wreaths of chain work  for the capitals 
which were upon the top of the pilla rs 
seven for the one capital  and seven for 
the other capital  18and he made the 
pillars  and there were two rows round 
about upon the one network  to cover 
the capitals that were upon the top of 
the pomegranates  and so did he for 
the other capital  19and the capitals 
that were upon the top of the pillars in 
the porch were of lily work  four 
cubits  20and there were capitals above 
also upon the two pillars  close by the 
belly which was beside the network  
and the pomegranates were two 
hundred  in rows rou nd about upon 
each capital  21and he set up the pillars first kings  
484 
 at the porch of the temple  and he set

thereof jachin  and he set up the left 
pillar  and called the name thereof 
boaz  22and upon the top of the pillars 
was l ilywork  so was the work of the 
pillars finished   
23and he made the molten sea of ten 
cubits from brim to brim  round in 
compass  and the height thereof was 
five cubits  and a line of thirty cubits 
did compass it round about  24and 
under the brim of it r ound about there

twelve oxen  three looking toward the 
north  and three looking toward the

south  and three looking toward the 
east and the sea was set upon them

inward  26and it was a hand breadth 
thick  and the brim thereof was 
wrought like the brim of a cup  like the 
flower of a lily  it held two thousand 
baths   
27and he made the ten bases of 
brass  four cubits was the length of one 
base and four cubits the breadth 
thereof  and three cubits the height of 
it 28and the work of the bases was on 
this manner  they had borders  and 
there w ere borders between the stays  
29and on the borders that were between 
the stays were lions  oxen  and 
cherubim  and upon the stays it was in 
like manner above  and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of 
hanging work  30and every base had 
four brazen wh eels and axles of brass  
and the four feet thereof had 
undersetters  beneath the laver were

at the side of each  31and the mouth of 
it within the crown and above was a 
cubit high  and the mouth thereof was 
round after  the work of a pedestal  a 
cubit and a half  and also upon the 
mouth of it were gravings  and their 
borders were foursquare  not round  
32and the four wheels were underneath 
the borders  and the axletrees of the 
wheels were in the base  and the height 
of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit  
33and the work of the wheels was like 
the work of a chariot wheel  their 
axletrees  and their felloes  and their 
spokes  and their naves  were all 
molten  34and there were four 
undersetters at the four corners of each 
base the undersetters thereof were of 
one piece with the base itself  35and in 
the top of the base was there a round 
compass of half a cubit high  and on 
the top of the base the stays thereof 
and the borders thereof were of one 
piece therewith  36and on th e plates of 
the stays thereof  and on the borders 
thereof  he graved cherubim  lions  and 
palm trees  according to the space of 
each with wreaths round about  
37after this manner he made the ten 
bases  all of them had one casting  one 
measure  and one for m  
38and he made ten lavers of brass  
one laver contained forty baths  and first kings  
485 
 every laver was four cubits  and upon 
every one of the ten bases one laver  
39and he set the bases  five on the 
right side of the house  and five on the 
left side of the house  and he set the 
sea on the right side of the house 
eastward  toward the south   
40and ahiram made the pots  and the 
shovels  and the basins   
so hiram made an end of doing all 
the work that he wrought for king 
solomon in the house of the lord 
41the two pillar s and the two bowls of 
the capitals that were on the top of the 
pillars  and the two networks to cover

bases  and the ten lavers on the bases  
44and the one sea  and the twelve oxen 
under the sea  45and the pots  and the 
shovels  and the basins  even all these 
vessels  which hiram made for king 
solomon  in the house of the lord 
were of burnished brass  46in the plain 
of the jordan did the king cast them  in 
the clay ground between succoth and 
zarethan  47and solomon left all the 
vessels unweighed  because they were 
exceeding many  the weight of the 
brass could not be found out  48and 
solomon made all the vessels that 
were in the house of the lord the 
                                                      
a heb hirom  golden altar  and the table whereupon 
the showbread was  of gold  49and the 
candlesticks  five on the right side  and

lamps  and the tongs  of gold  50and the 
cups and the snuffers  and the basins  
and the pans  and the fire pans of pure 
gold and the hinges  both for the 
doors of the inner house  the most holy 
place  and for the doors of the house  
that is  of the temple  of gold   
51thus all the work that king 
solomon wrought in the house of the 
lord was finished  and solomon 
brought in the things which david his 
father had d edicated  the silver  and 
the gold  and the vessels  and put them 
in the treasuries of the house of the 
lord  
then solomon assembled the 
elders of israel  and all the heads 
of the tribes  the princes of the 
fathers houses of the children of israel  
unto king solomon in jerusalem  to 
bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
lord out of the city of david  which is 
zion  2and all the men of israel 
assembled themselves unto king 
solomon at the feast  in the month 
ethanim  which is the seventh month  
3and all the elders of israel came  and 
the priests took up the ark  4and they 
brought up the ark of the lord and the 
tent of meeting  and all the holy 
vessels that were in the tent  even 
these did the priests and the levites 
bring up  5and king solomon and all 
the congregation of israel  that were 8 first kings  
486 
 assembled unto him  were with him 
before the ark  sacrificing sheep and 
oxen  that could not be told nor 
numbered for multitude  6and the 
priests brought in the ark of the 
covenant of the lord unto its place  
into the sa nctuary of the house  to the 
most holy place  even under the wings 
of the cherubim  7for the cherubim 
spread forth their wings over the place 
of the ark  and the cherubim covered 
the ark and the staves thereof above  
8and the staves were so long that the 
ends of the staves were seen from the 
holy place  even before the sanctuary  
but they could not be seen without  
and there they are unto this day  9there 
was nothing in the ark save the two 
tables of stone which moses put there 
at horeb  when the lord made a 
covenant with the children of israel 
when they came out of the land of 
egypt  10and it came to pass  when the 
priests were come out of the holy 
place  that the cloud filled the house of 
the lord 11so that the priests could not 
stand to minister by reaso n of the 
cloud  for the glory of the lord filled 
the house of the lord  
12then spoke solomon   
the lord hath said that he would 
dwell in the thick darkness   
13i have surely built thee a house of    
 habitation   
a place for thee to dwell in for 
ever  
14and the king turned his face about  
and blessed all the congregation of 
israel  and all the congregation of israel stood  15and he said  blessed 
be the lord the god of israel  who 
spoke with his mouth unto david my 
father  and hath with his hand fulfilled  
it saying  16since the day that i 
brought forth my people israel out of 
egypt  i chose no city out of all the 
tribes of israel to build a house  that 
my name might be there  but i chose 
david to be over my people israel  
17now it was in the heart of davi d my 
father to build a house for the name of 
the lord the god of israel  18but the 
lord said unto david my father  
whereas it was in thy heart to build a 
house for my name  thou didst well 
that it was in thy heart  19nevertheless 
thou shalt not build the house  but thy 
son that shall come forth out of thy 
loins  he shall build the house for my 
name  20and the lord hath established 
his word that he spoke  for i am risen 
up in the room of david my father  and 
sit on the throne of israel  as the lord 
promised  and have built the house for 
the name of the lord the god of 
israel  21and there have i set a place 
for the ark  wherein is the covenant of 
the lord which he made with our 
fathers  when he brought them out of 
the land of egypt   
22and solomon stood be fore the 
altar of the lord in the presence of all 
the congregation of israel  and spread 
forth his hands toward heaven  23and 
he said  o lord the god of israel  
there is no god like thee  in heaven 
above  or on earth beneath  who 
keepest covenant and mer cy with thy first kings  
487 
 servants  that walk before thee with 
all their heart  24who hast kept with 
thy servant david my father that 
which thou didst promise him  yea 
thou spokest with thy mouth  and 
hast fulfilled it with thy hand  as it is 
this day  25now therefore  o lord the 
god of israel  keep with thy servant 
david my father that which thou hast 
promised him saying  there shall not 
fail thee a man in my sight to sit on 
the throne of israel  if only thy 
children take heed to their way  to 
walk before me as thou h ast walked 
before me  26now therefore  o god of 
israel  let thy word  i pray thee  be 
verified  which thou didst speak unto 
thy servant david my father   
27but will god in very truth dwell 
on the earth  behold  heaven and the 
heaven of heavens cannot conta in 
thee  how much less this house that i 
have builded  28yet have thou respect 
unto the prayer of thy servant  and to 
his supplication  o lord my god  to 
hearken unto the cry and to the prayer 
which thy servant prayeth before 
thee this day  29that thine ey es may 
be open toward this house night and 
day even toward the place whereof 
thou hast said  my name shall be 
there  to hearken unto the prayer 
which thy servant shall pray toward 
this place  30and hearken thou to the 
supplication of thy servant  and of 
thy people israel  when they shall 
pray toward this place  yea hear thou 
in heaven thy dwelling place  and 
when thou hearest  forgive   31if a man sin against his neighbour  
and an oath be exacted of him to cause 
him to swear  and he come and swear 
before thine altar in this house  32then 
hear thou in heaven  and do  and 
judge thy servants  condemning the 
wicked  to bring his way upon his own 
head  and justifying the righteous  to 
give him according to his 
righteousness   
33when thy people israel are 
smitte n down before the enemy  when 
they do sin against thee  if they turn 
again to thee  and confess thy name  
and pray and make supplication unto 
thee in this house  34then hear thou in 
heaven  and forgive the sin of thy 
people israel  and bring them back 
unto the land which thou gavest unto 
their fathers   
35when heaven is shut up  and there 
is no rain  when they do sin against 
thee  if they pray toward this place  
and confess thy name  and turn from 
their sin  when thou dost afflict them  
36then hear thou in heaven  and 
forgive the sin of thy servants  and of 
thy people israel  when thou teachest 
them the good way wherein they 
should walk  and send rain upon thy 
land which thou hast given to thy 
people for an inheritance   
37if there be in the land famine  if 
there be pestilence  if there be blasting 
or mildew  locust or caterpillar  if their 
enemy besiege them in the land of 
their cities  whatsoever plague  
whatsoever sickness there be  38what 
prayer and supplication soever be first kings  
488 
 made by any man of all thy peopl e 
israel  who shall know every man the 
plague of his own heart  and spread 
forth his hands toward this house  
39then hear thou in heaven thy 
dwelling place  and forgive  and do  
and render unto every man according 
to all his ways  whose heart thou 
knowest for thou  even thou only  
knowest the hearts of all the children 
of men  40that they may fear thee all 
the days that they live in the land 
which thou gavest unto our fathers   
41moreover concerning the stranger 
that is not of thy people israel  when 
he sha ll come out of a far country for 
thy name s sake  42for they shall 
hear of thy great name  and of thy 
mighty hand  and of thine 
outstretched arm when he shall come 
and pray toward this house  43hear 
thou in heaven thy dwelling place  
and do according to al l that the 
stranger calleth to thee for  that all the 
peoples of the earth may know thy 
name  to fear thee  as doth thy people 
israel  and that they may know that 
thy name is called upon this house 
which i have built   
44if thy people go out to battle 
against their enemy  by whatsoever 
way thou shalt send them  and they 
pray unto the lord toward the city 
which thou hast chosen  and toward 
the house which i have built for thy 
name  45then hear thou in heaven their 
prayer and their supplication  and 
maintain their cause  46if they sin 
against thee for there is no man that sinneth not and thou be angry with 
them  and deliver them to the enemy  
so that they carry them away captive 
unto the land of the enemy  far off or 
near 47yet if they shall bethink 
themselve s in the land whither they are 
carried captive  and turn back  and 
make supplication unto thee in the 
land of them that carried them captive  
saying  we have sinned  and have 
done iniquitously  we have dealt 
wickedly  48if they return unto thee 
with all th eir heart and with all their 
soul in the land of their enemies  who 
carried them captive  and pray unto 
thee toward their land  which thou 
gavest unto their fathers  the city 
which thou hast chosen  and the house 
which i have built for thy name  
49then hea r thou their prayer and their 
supplication in heaven thy dwelling 
place  and maintain their cause  50and 
forgive thy people who have sinned 
against thee  and all their 
transgressions wherein they have 
transgressed against thee  and give 
them compassion bef ore those who 
carried them captive  that they may 
have compassion on them  51for they 
are thy people  and thine inheritance  
which thou broughtest forth out of 
egypt  from the midst of the furnace of 
iron 52that thine eyes may be open 
unto the supplicatio n of thy servant  
and unto the supplication of thy 
people israel  to hearken unto them 
whensoever they cry unto thee  53for 
thou didst set them apart from among 
all the peoples of the earth  to be thine first kings  
489 
 inheritance  as thou didst speak by the 
hand of moses  thy servant  when 
thou broughtest our fathers out of 
egypt  o lord g od  
54and it was so  that when solomon 
had made an end of praying all this 
prayer and supplication unto the lord 
he arose from before the altar of the 
lord from kneeling on his knees with 
his hands spread forth toward heaven  
55and he stood  and blessed all the 
congregation of israel with a loud 
voice  saying  56blessed be the lord 
that hath given rest unto his people 
israel  according to all that he 
promised  there hath not failed o ne 
word of all his good promise  which 
he promised by the hand of moses his 
servant  57the lord our god be with 
us as he was with our fathers  let him 
not leave us  nor forsake us  58that he 
may incline our hearts unto him  to 
walk in all his ways  and to  keep his 
commandments  and his statutes  and 
his ordinances  which he commanded 
our fathers  59and let these my words  
wherewith i have made supplication 
before the lord be nigh unto the lord 
our god day and night  that he 
maintain the cause of his serva nt and 
the cause of his people israel  as every 
day shall require  60that all the peoples 
of the earth may know that the lord 
he is god  there is none else  61let 
your heart therefore be whole with the 
lord our god  to walk in his statutes  
and to keep h is commandments  as at 
this day  62and the king  and all israel 
with him  offered sacrifice before the lord 63and solomon offered for the 
sacrifice of peace offerings  which he 
offered unto the lord two and twenty 
thousand oxen  and a hundred and 
twenty  thousand sheep  so the king 
and all the children of israel dedicated 
the house of the lord 64the same day 
did the king hallow the middle of the 
court that was before the house of the 
lord for there he offered the burnt 
offering  and the meal offering  and 
the fat of the peace offerings  because 
the brazen altar that was before the 
lord was too little to receive the 
burnt offering  and the meal offering  
and the fat of the peace offerings   
65so solomon held the feast at that 
time and all israel with him  a great 
congregation  from the entrance 
hamath unto the brook of egypt  
before the lord our god  seven days 
and seven days  even fourteen days  
66on the eighth day he sent the people 
away  and they blessed the king  and 
went unto their tents joyful and g lad of 
heart for all the goodness that the lord 
had shown unto david his servant  
and to israel his people   
and it came to pass  when 
solomon had finished the 
building of the house of the lord and 
the king s house  and all solomon s 
delight which he wa s pleased to do  
2that the lord appeared to solomon 
the second time  as he had appeared 
unto him at gibeon  3and the lord 
said unto him  i have heard thy prayer 
and thy supplication  that thou hast 
made before me  i have hallowed this 9 first kings  
490 
 house  which thou ha st built  to put my 
name there for ever  and mine eyes 
and my heart shall be there 
perpetually  4and as for thee  if thou 
wilt walk before me  as david thy 
father walked  in integrity of heart  and 
in uprightness  to do according to all 
that i have command ed thee  and wilt 
keep my statutes and mine ordinances  
5then i will establish the throne of thy 
kingdom over israel for ever  
according as i promised to david thy 
father  saying  there shall not fail thee 
a man upon the throne of israel  6but if 
ye shall turn away from following me  
ye or your children  and not keep my 
commandments and my statutes which 
i have set before you  but shall go and 
serve other gods  and worship them  
7then will i cut off israel out of the 
land which i have given them  and this 
house which i have hallowed for my 
name  will i cast out of my sight  and 
israel shall be a proverb and a by word 
among all peoples  8and this house 
which is so high shall become 
desolate  and every one that passeth 
by it shall be astonished  and shall 
hiss and when they shall say  why 
hath the lord done thus unto this land  
and to this house  9they shall be 
answered  because they forsook the 
lord their god  who brought forth 
their fathers out of the land of egypt  
and laid hold on other gods  and 
worshi pped them  and served them  
therefore hath the lord brought all this 
evil upon them   10and it came to pass at the end of 
twenty years  wherein solomon had 
built the two houses  the house of the 
lord and the king s house 11now 
hiram the king of tyre had f urnished 
solomon with cedar trees and cypress 
trees  and with gold  according to all 
his desire that then king solomon 
gave hiram twenty cities in the land of 
galilee  12and hiram came out from 
tyre to see the cities which solomon 
had given him  and they p leased him 
not 13and he said  what cities are 
these which thou hast given me  my 
brother  and they were called the 
land of cabul  unto this day  14and 
hiram sent to the king sixscore talents 
of gold  15and this is the account of 
the levy which king solo mon raised  
to build the house of the lord and his 
own house  and millo  and the wall of 
jerusalem  and hazor  and megiddo  
and gezer  16pharaoh king of egypt 
had gone up  and taken gezer  and 
burnt it with fire  and slain the 
canaanites that dwelt in the  city and 
given it for a portion unto his 
daughter  solomon s wife  17and 
solomon built gezer  and beth horon 
the nether  18and baalath  and tadmor 
in the wilderness  in the land  19and all 
the store cities that solomon had  and 
the cities for his chariot s and the cities 
for his horsemen  and that which 
solomon desired to build for his 
pleasure in jerusalem  and in lebanon  
and in all the land of his dominion  
20all the people that were left of the 
amorites  the hittites  the perizzites  first kings  
491 
 the hivites  and the jebusites  who 
were not of the children of israel  
21even their children that were left 
after them in the land  whom the 
children of israel were not able utterly 
to destroy  of them did solomon raise 
a levy of bondservants  unto this day  
22but of the children of israel did 
solomon make no bondservants  but 
they were the men of war  and his 
servants  and his princes  and his 
captains  and rulers of his chariots and 
of his horsemen   
23these were the chief officers that 
were over solomon s work  five 
hundred and fifty  who bore rule over 
the people that wrought in the work   
24but pharaoh s daughter came up 
out of the city of david unto her house 
which solomon  had built for her  
then did he build millo   
25and three times in a year did 
solomon offer bur ntofferings and 
peace offerings upon the altar which 
he built unto the lord offering 
thereby  upon the altar that was before 
the lord so he finished the house  
26and king solomon made a navy of 
ships in ezion geber  which is beside 
eloth  on the shore o f the red sea  in 
the land of edom  27and hiram sent in 
the navy his servants  shipmen that had 
knowledge of the sea  with the 
servants of solomon  28and they came 
to ophir  and fetched from thence 
gold four hundred and twenty talents  
and brought it to k ing solomon   
and when the queen of sheba 
heard of the fame of solomon because of the name of the lord she 
came to prove him with hard 
questions  2and she came to jerusalem 
with a very great train  with camels 
that bore spices and gold very much  
and p recious stones  and when she was 
come to solomon  she spoke with him 
of all that was in her heart  3and 
solomon told her all her questions  
there was not any thing hid from the 
king which he told her not  4and when 
the queen of sheba had seen all the 
wisdo m of solomon  and the house 
that he had built  5and the food of his 
table  and the sitting of his servants  
and the attendance of his ministers  
and their apparel  and his cupbearers  
and his burnt offering which he 
offered in the house of the lord there 
was no more spirit in her  6and she 
said to the king  it was a true report 
that i heard in mine own land of thine 
acts and of thy wisdom  7howbeit i 
believed not the words  until i came  
and mine eyes had seen it  and behold  
the half was not told me  thou hast 
wisdom and prosperity exceeding the 
fame which i heard  8happy are thy 
men happy are these thy servants  that 
stand continually before thee  and that 
hear thy wisdom  9blessed be the lord 
thy god  who delighted in thee  to set 
thee on the throne of israel  because 
the lord loved israel for ever  
therefore made he thee king  to do 
justice and righteousness  10and she 
gave the king a hundred and twenty 
talents of gold  and of spices very 
great store  and precious stones  there 10 first kings  
492 
 came no more such abu ndance of 
spices as these which the queen of 
sheba gave to king solomon  11and 
the navy also of hiram  that brought 
gold from ophir  brought in from 
ophir great plenty of sandal wood and 
precious stones  12and the king made 
of the sandal wood pillars for t he 
house of the lord and for the king s 
house  harps also and psalteries for the 
singers  there came no such sandal 
wood  nor was seen  unto this day  
13and king solomon gave to the queen 
of sheba all her desire  whatsoever she 
asked  beside that which so lomon 
gave her of his royal bounty  so she 
turned  and went to her own land  she 
and her servants   
14now the weight of gold that came 
to solomon in one year was six 
hundred threescore and six talents of 
gold 15beside that which came of the 
merchants  and of the traffic of the 
traders  and of all the kings of the 
mingled people and of the governors 
of the country  16and king solomon 
made two hundred targets of beaten 
gold six hundred shekels of gold went 
to one target  17and he made three 
hundred shields of beaten gold  three 
pounds of gold went to one shield  and 
the king put them in the house of the 
forest of lebanon   
18moreover the king made a great 
throne of ivory  and overlaid it with 
the finest gold  19there were six steps 
to the throne  and the top  of the throne 
was round behind  and there were 
arms on either side by the place of the seat and two lions standing beside the 
arms  20and twelve lions stood there 
on the one side and on the other upon 
the six steps  there was not the like 
made in any kin gdom   
21and all king solomon s drinking 
vessels were of gold  and all the 
vessels of the house of the forest of 
lebanon were of pure gold  none were 
of silver  it was nothing accounted of 
in the days of solomon  22for the king 
had at sea a navy of tarshis h with the 
navy of hiram  once every three years 
came the navy of tarshish  bringing 
gold and silver  ivory  and apes  and 
peacocks   
23so king solomon exceeded all the 
kings of the earth in riches and in 
wisdom  24and all the earth sought the 
presence of  solomon  to hear his 
wisdom  which god had put in his 
heart  25and they brought every man 
his present  vessels of silver  and 
vessels of gold  and raiment  and 
armour  and spices  horses  and mules  
a rate year by year   
26and solomon gathered together 
chariots and horsemen  and he had a 
thousand and four hundred chariots  
and twelve thousand horsemen  that he 
bestowed in the chariot cities  and with 
the king at jerusalem  27and the king 
made silver to be in jerusalem as 
stones  and cedars made he to be as  the 
sycamore trees that are in the 
lowland  for abundance  28and the 
horses which solomon had were 
brought out of egypt  also out of 
keveh  the king s merchants buying first kings  
493 
 them of the men of keveh at a price  
29and a chariot came up and went out 
of egypt for six hundred shekels of 
silver  and a horse for a hundred and 
fifty and so for all the kings of the 
hittites  and for the kings of aram  did 
they bring them out by their means   
now king solomon loved 
many foreign women  besides 
the daughter of pharaoh  women of the 
moabites  ammonites  edomites  
zidonians  and hittites  2of the nations 
concerning which the lord said unto 
the children of israel  ye shall not go 
among them  neither shall they come 
among you  for surely they will turn 
away your heart afte r their gods  
solomon did cleave unto these in love  
3and he had seven hundred wives  
princesses  and three hundred 
concubines  and his wives turned away 
his heart  4for it came to pass  when 
solomon was old  that his wives 
turned away his heart after oth er gods  
and his heart was not whole with the 
lord his god  as was the heart of 
david his father  5for solomon went 
after ashtoreth the goddess of the 
zidonians  and after milcom the 
detestation of the ammonites  6and 
solomon did that which was evil in the  
sight of the lord and went not fully 
after the lord as did david his father  
7then did solomon build a high place 
for chemosh the detestation of moab  
in the mount that is before jerusalem  
and for molech the detestation of the 
children of ammon  8and s o did he for all his foreign wives  who offered and 
sacrificed unto their gods   
9and the lord was angry with 
solomon  because his heart was turned 
away from the lord the god of israel  
who had appeared unto him twice  
10and had commanded him concerning 
this thing  that he should not go after 
other gods  but he kept not that which 
the lord commanded  11wherefore the 
lord said unto solomon  forasmuch 
as this hath been in thy mind  and thou 
hast not kept my covenant and my 
statutes  which i have commanded 
thee i will surely rend the kingdom 
from thee  and will give it to thy 
servant  12notwithstanding in thy days 
i will not do it  for david thy father s 
sake but i will rend it out of the hand 
of thy son  13howbeit i will not rend 
away all the kingdom  but i will give 
one tribe to thy son  for david my 
servant s sake  and for jerusalem s 
sake which i have chosen   
14and the lord raised up an 
adversary unto solomon  hadad the 
edomite  he was of the king s seed in 
edom  15for it came to pass  when 
david was i n edom  and joab the 
captain of the host was gone up to 
bury the slain  and had smitten every 
male in edom 16for joab and all 
israel remained there six months  until 
he had cut off every male in edom 
17that ahadad fled  he and certain 
edomites of his fathe rs servants with 
him to go into egypt  hadad being yet 
                                                      
a heb adad  11 first kings  
494 
 a little child  18and they arose out of 
midian  and came to paran  and they 
took men with them out of paran  and 
they came to egypt  unto pharaoh king 
of egypt  who gave him a house  and 
appointed hi m victuals  and gave him 
land 19and hadad found great favour 
in the sight of pharaoh  so that he gave 
him to wife the sister of his own wife  
the sister of tahpenes the queen  
20and the sister of tahpenes bore him 
genubath his son  whom tahpenes 
weaned in  pharaoh s house  and 
genubath was in pharaoh s house 
among the sons of pharaoh  21and 
when hadad heard in egypt that david 
slept with his fathers  and that joab the 
captain of the host was dead  hadad 
said to pharaoh  let me depart  that i 
may go to mine  own country  22then 
pharaoh said unto him  but what hast 
thou lacked with me  that behold  thou 
seekest to go to thine own country  
and he answered  nothing  howbeit 
let me depart in any wise   
23and god raised up another 
adversary unto him  rezon t he son of 
eliada  who had fled from his lord 
hadadezer king of zobah  24and he 
gathered men unto him  and became 
captain over a troop  when david slew 
them of zobah  and they went to 
damascus  and dwelt therein  and 
reigned in damascus  25and he was an 
adversary to israel all the days of 
solomon  beside the mischief that 
hadad did  and he abhorred israel  and 
reigned over aram   26and jeroboam the son of nebat  
an ephraimite of zeredah  a servant of 
solomon  whose mother s name was 
zeruah  a widow  he als o lifted up his 
hand against the king  27and this was 
the cause that he lifted up his hand 
against the king  solomon built millo  
and repaired the breach of the city of 
david his father  28and the man 
jeroboam was a mighty man of valour  
and solomon saw th e young man that 
he was industrious  and he gave him 
charge over all the labour of the house 
of joseph  29and it came to pass at that 
time when jeroboam went out of 
jerusalem  that the prophet ahijah the 
shilonite found him in the way  now 
ahijah had clad  himself with a new 
garment  and they two were alone in 
the field  30and ahijah laid hold of the 
new garment that was on him  and rent 
it in twelve pieces  31and he said to 
jeroboam  take thee ten pieces  for 
thus saith the lord the god of israel  
behold  i will rend the kingdom out of 
the hand of solomon  and will give ten 
tribes to thee  32but he shall have one 
tribe for my servant david s sake  and 
for jerusalem s sake  the city which i 
have chosen out of all the tribes of 
israel  33because that they have 
forsaken me  and have worshipped 
ashtoreth the goddess of the 
zidonians  chemosh the god of moab  
and milcom the god of the children of 
ammon  and they have not walked in 
my ways  to do that which is right in 
mine eyes  and to keep my statutes 
and min e ordinances  as did david his first kings  
495 
 father  34howbeit i will not take the 
whole kingdom out of his hand  but i 
will make him prince all the days of 
his life  for david my servant s sake  
whom i chose  because he kept my 
commandments and my statutes  35but 
i wil l take the kingdom out of his 
sons hand  and will give it unto thee  
even ten tribes  36and unto his son will 
i give one tribe  that david my servant 
may have a lamp alway before me in 
jerusalem  the city which i have 
chosen me to put my name there  
37and i will take thee  and thou shalt 
reign over all that thy soul desireth  
and shalt be king over israel  38and it 
shall be  if thou wilt hearken unto all 
that i command thee  and wilt walk in 
my ways  and do that which is right in 
mine eyes  to keep my stat utes and 
my commandments  as david my 
servant did  that i will be with thee  
and will build thee a sure house  as i 
built for david  and will give israel 
unto thee  39and i will for this afflict 
the seed of david  but not for ever   
40solomon sought there fore to kill 
jeroboam  but jeroboam arose  and 
fled into egypt  unto shishak king of 
egypt  and was in egypt until the 
death of solomon   
41now the rest of the acts of 
solomon  and all that he did  and his 
wisdom  are they not written in the 
book of the ac ts of solomon  42and 
the time that solomon reigned in 
jerusalem over all israel was forty 
years  43and solomon slept with his 
fathers  and was buried in the city of david his father  and rehoboam his 
son reigned in his stead   
and rehoboam went to 
shech em for all israel were 
come to shechem to make him king  
2and it came to pass  when jeroboam 
the son of nebat heard of it for he 
was yet in egypt  whither he had fled 
from the presence of king solomon  
and jeroboam dwelt in egypt  3and 
they sent and calle d him that 
jeroboam and all the congregation of 
israel came  and spoke unto 
rehoboam  saying  4thy father made 
our yoke grievous  now therefore 
make thou the grievous service of thy 
father  and his heavy yoke which he 
put upon us  lighter  and we will ser ve 
thee 5and he said unto them  depart 
yet for three days  then come again to 
me and the people departed   
6and king rehoboam took counsel 
with the old men  that had stood before 
solomon his father while he yet lived  
saying  what counsel give ye me to 
return answer to this people  7and 
they spoke unto him  saying  if thou 
wilt be a servant unto this people this 
day and wilt serve them  and answer 
them  and speak good words to them  
then they will be thy servants for 
ever 8but he forsook the coun sel of 
the old men which they had given him  
and took counsel with the young men 
that were grown up with him  that 
stood before him  9and he said unto 
them  what counsel give ye  that we 
may return answer to this people  who 
have spoken to me  saying  make the 12 first kings  
496 
 yoke that thy father did put upon us 
lighter  10and the young men that 
were grown up with him spoke unto 
him saying  thus shalt thou say unto 
this people that spoke unto thee  
saying  thy father made our yoke 
heavy  but make thou it lighter unto 
us thus shalt thou speak unto them  
my little finger is thicker than my 
father s loins  11and now whereas my 
father did burden you with a heavy 
yoke  i will add to your yoke  my 
father chastised you with whips  but i 
will chastise you with scorpions   
12so jeroboam and all the people 
came to rehoboam the third day  as 
the king bade  saying  come to me 
again the third day  13and the king 
answered the people roughly  and 
forsook the counsel of the old men 
which they had given him  14and spoke 
to them after  the counsel of the young 
men saying  my father made your 
yoke heavy  but i will add to your 
yoke  my father chastised you with 
whips  but i will chastise you with 
scorpions  15so the king hearkened 
not unto the people  for it was a thing 
brought about of the lord that he 
might establish his word  which the 
lord spoke by the hand of ahijah the 
shilonite to jeroboam the son of 
nebat  16and when all israel saw that 
the king hearkened not unto them  the 
people answered the king  saying  
what portion have we in david  
neither have we inheritance in the son 
of jesse  to your tents  o israel  now 
see to thine own house  david  so israel departed unto their tents  17but 
as for the children of israel that dwelt 
in the cities of judah  rehoboam 
reigned over the m 18then king 
rehoboam sent adoram  who was 
over the levy  and all israel stoned him 
with stones  so that he died  and king 
rehoboam made speed to get him up 
to his chariot  to flee to jerusalem  
19so israel rebelled against the house 
of david  unto this day 20and it came 
to pass  when all israel heard that 
jeroboam was returned  that they sent 
and called him unto the congregation  
and made him king over all israel  
there was none that followed the house 
of david  but the tribe of judah only  
21and when r ehoboam was come to 
jerusalem  be assembled all the house 
of judah  and the tribe of benjamin  a 
hundred and fourscore thousand 
chosen men that were warriors  to fight 
against the house of israel  to bring the 
kingdom back to rehoboam the son of 
solomon  22but the word of god came 
unto shemaiah the man of god  
saying  23speak unto rehoboam the 
son of solomon  king of judah  and 
unto all the house of judah and 
benjamin  and to the rest of the 
people  saying  24thus saith the lord 
ye shall not go up  nor fi ght against 
your brethren the children of israel  
return every man to his house  for this 
thing is of me  so they hearkened 
unto the word of the lord and 
returned and went their way  according 
to the word of the lord  first kings  
497 
 25then jeroboam built shechem in 
the hill country of ephraim  and dwelt 
therein  and he went out from thence  
and built penuel  26and jeroboam said 
in his heart  now will the kingdom 
return to the house of david  27if this 
people go up to offer sacrifices in the 
house of the lord at jerusa lem then 
will the heart of this people turn back 
unto their lord  even unto rehoboam 
king of judah  and they will kill me  
and return to rehoboam king of 
judah  28whereupon the king took 
counsel  and made two calves of gold  
and he said unto them  ye ha ve gone 
up long enough to jerusalem  behold 
thy gods  o israel  which brought thee 
up out of the land of egypt  29and he 
set the one in beth el and the other 
put he in dan  30and this thing became 
a sin  for the people went to worship 
before the one  even unto dan  31and 
he made houses of high places  and 
made priests from among all the 
people  that were not of the sons of 
levi 32and jeroboam ordained a feast 
in the eighth month  on the fifteenth 
day of the month  like unto the feast 
that is in judah  and he went up unto 
the altar  so did he in beth el to 
sacrifice unto the calves that he had 
made  and he placed in beth el the 
priests of the high places that he had 
made  33and he went up unto the altar 
which he had made in beth el on the 
fifteenth day in  the eighth month  even 
in the month which he had devised of 
his own heart  and he ordained a feast for the children of israel  and went up 
unto the altar  to offer   
and behold  there came a 
man of god out of judah by 
the word of the lord unto beth el and 
jeroboam was standing by the altar to 
offer  2and he cried against the altar 
by the word of the lord and said  o 
altar altar thus saith the lord 
behold  a son shall be born unto the 
house of david  josiah by name  and 
upon thee shall he sacrific e the priests 
of the high places that offer upon thee  
and men s bones shall they burn upon 
thee 3and he gave a sign the same 
day saying  this is the sign which the 
lord hath spoken  behold  the altar 
shall be rent  and the ashes that are 
upon it shall be poured out  4and it 
came to pass  when the king heard the 
saying of the man of god  which he 
cried against the altar in beth el that 
jeroboam put forth his hand from the 
altar saying  lay hold on him  and 
his hand  which he put forth against 
him dried up  so that he could not 
draw it back to him  5the altar also 
was rent  and the ashes poured out 
from the altar  according to the sign 
which the man of god had given by 
the word of the lord 6and the king 
answered and said unto the man of 
god entrea t now the favour of the 
lord thy god  and pray for me  that 
my hand may be restored me  and the 
man of god entreated the lord and 
the king s hand was restored him  and 
became as it was before  7and the king 
said unto the man of god  come 13 first kings  
498 
 home with me  and refresh thyself  and 
i will give thee a reward  8and the 
man of god said unto the king  if 
thou wilt give me half thy house  i will 
not go in with thee  neither will i eat 
bread nor drink water in this place  
9for it so was charged me by the word 
of the lord saying  thou shalt eat no 
bread  nor drink water  neither return 
by the way that thou camest  10so he 
went another way  and returned not by 
the way that he came to beth el  
11now there dwelt an old prophet in 
beth el and one of his sons came an d 
told him all the works that the man of 
god had done that day in beth el and 
the words which he had spoken unto 
the king  and they told them unto their 
father  12and their father said unto 
them  what way went he  for his 
sons had seen what way the man of 
god went  that came from judah  
13and he said unto his sons  saddle 
me the ass  so they saddled him the 
ass and he rode thereon  14and he 
went after the man of god  and found 
him sitting under a terebinth  and he 
said unto him  art thou the man of 
god that camest from judah  and he 
said i am  15then he said unto him  
come home with me  and eat bread  
16and he said  i may not return with 
thee nor go in with thee  neither will i 
eat bread nor drink water with thee in 
this place  17for it was sa id to me by 
the word of the lord thou shalt eat 
no bread nor drink water there  nor 
turn back to go by the way that thou 
camest  18and he said unto him  i also am a prophet as thou art  and an 
angel spoke unto me by the word of 
the lord saying  bring h im back with 
thee into thy house  that he may eat 
bread and drink water he lied unto 
him19so he went back with him  
and did eat bread in his house  and 
drank water   
20and it came to pass  as they sat at 
the table  that the word of the lord 
came unto t he prophet that brought 
him back  21and he cried unto the man 
of god that came from judah  saying  
thus saith the lord forasmuch as 
thou hast rebelled against the word of 
the lord and hast not kept the 
commandment which the lord thy 
god commanded thee  22but camest 
back  and hast eaten bread and drunk 
water in the place of which he said to 
thee eat no bread  and drink no water  
thy carcass shall not come unto the 
sepulchre of thy fathers  23and it 
came to pass  after he had eaten bread  
and after he ha d drunk  that he saddled 
for him the ass  namely  for the 
prophet whom he had brought back  
24and when he was gone  a lion met 
him by the way  and slew him  and his 
carcass was cast in the way  and the 
ass stood by it  the lion also stood by 
the carcass  25and behold  men passed 
by and saw the carcass cast in the 
way and the lion standing by the 
carcass  and they came and told it in 
the city where the old prophet dwelt   
26and when the prophet that brought 
him back from the way heard thereof  
he said  it is the man of god  who first kings  
499 
 rebelled against the word of the lord 
therefore the lord hath delivered him 
unto the lion  which hath torn him  and 
slain him  according to the word of the 
lord which he spoke unto him  
27and he spoke to his sons  saying  
saddle me the ass  and they saddled 
it 28and he went and found his carcass 
cast in the way  and the ass and the 
lion standing by the carcass  the lion 
had not eaten the carcass  nor torn the 
ass 29and the prophet took up the 
carcass of the man of god  and la id it 
upon the ass  and brought it back  and 
he came to the city of the old prophet  
to lament  and to bury him  30and he 
laid his carcass in his own grave  and 
they made lamentation for him  alas 
my brother   31and it came to pass  
after he had buried him that he spoke 
to his sons  saying  when i am dead  
then bury me in the sepulchre wherein 
the man of god is buried  lay my 
bones beside his bones  32for the 
saying which he cried by the word of 
the lord against the altar in beth el 
and against all th e houses of the high 
places which are in the cities of 
samaria  shall surely come to pass   
33after this thing jeroboam returned 
not from his evil way  but made again 
from among all the people priests of 
the high places  whosoever would  he 
consecrated hi m that he might be one 
of the priests of the high places  34and 
by this thing there was sin unto the 
house of jeroboam  even to cut it off  
and to destroy it from off the face of 
the earth   at that time abijah the son of 
jeroboam fell sick  2and 
jerob oam said to his wife  arise  i 
pray thee  and disguise thyself  that 
thou be not known to be the wife of 
jeroboam  and get thee to shiloh  
behold  there is ahijah the prophet  
who spoke concerning me that i 
should be king over this people  3and 
take with thee ten loaves  and biscuits  
and a cruse of honey  and go to him  
he will tell thee what shall become of 
the child  4and jeroboam s wife did 
so and arose  and went to shiloh  and 
came to the house of ahijah  now 
ahijah could not see  for his eyes were 
set by reason of his age  5now the 
lord had said unto ahijah  behold  
the wife of jeroboam cometh to 
inquire of thee concerning her son  for 
he is sick  thus and thus shalt thou say 
unto her  for it will be  when she 
cometh in  that she will feign herself  to 
be another woman   
6and it was so  when ahijah heard 
the sound of her feet  as she came in at 
the door  that he said  come in  thou 
wife of jeroboam  why feignest thou 
thyself to be another  for i am sent to 
thee with heavy tidings  7go tell 
jeroboa m thus saith the lord the 
god of israel  forasmuch as i exalted 
thee from among the people  and made 
thee prince over my people israel  
8and rent the kingdom away from the 
house of david  and gave it thee  and 
yet thou hast not been as my servant 
david  who kept my commandments  
and who followed me with all his 14 first kings  
500 
 heart  to do that only which was right 
in mine eyes  9but hast done evil 
above all that were before thee  and 
hast gone and made thee other gods  
and molten images  to provoke me  
and hast cast me behind thy back  
10therefore  behold  i will bring evil 
upon the house of jeroboam  and will 
cut off from jeroboam every man 
child  and him that is shut up and him 
that is left at large in israel  and will 
utterly sweep away the house of 
jeroboam  as a man  sweepeth away 
dung  till it be all gone  11him that 
dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the 
dogs eat  and him that dieth in the field 
shall the fowls of the air eat  for the 
lord hath spoken it  12arise thou 
therefore  get thee to thy house  and 
when thy feet enter into the city  the 
child shall die  13and all israel shall 
make lamentation for him  and bury 
him for he only of jeroboam shall 
come to the grave  because in him 
there is found some good thing toward 
the lord the god of israel  in the 
house of  jeroboam  14moreover the 
lord will raise him up a king over 
israel  who shall cut off the house of 
jeroboam that day  but what is it even 
then 15for the lord will smite israel  
as a reed is shaken in the water  and 
he will root up israel out of this good  
land which he gave to their fathers  
and will scatter them beyond the 
river  because they have made their 
asherim  provoking the lord 16and 
he will give israel up because of the 
sins of jeroboam  which he hath sinned  and wherewith he hath made 
israel t o sin   
17and jeroboam s wife arose  and 
departed  and came to tirzah  and as 
she came to the threshold of the house  
the child died  18and all israel buried 
him and made lamentation for him  
according to the word of the lord 
which he spoke by the hand of his 
servant ahijah the prophet   
19and the rest of the acts of 
jeroboam  how he warred  and how he 
reigned  behold  they are written in the 
book of the chronicles of the kings of 
israel  20and the days which jeroboam 
reigned were two and twenty years  
and he slept with his fathers  and 
nadab his son reigned in his stead   
21and rehoboam the son of 
solomon reigned in judah  rehoboam 
was forty and one years old when he 
began to reign  and he reigned 
seventeen years in jerusalem  the city 
which the lord had chosen out of all 
the tribes of israel  to put his name 
there  and his mother s name was 
naamah the ammonitess  22and judah 
did that which was evil in the sight of 
the lord and they moved him to 
jealousy with their sins which they 
committed  above all th at their fathers 
had done  23for they also built them 
high places  and pillars  and asherim  
on every high hill  and under every 
leafy tree  24and there were also 
sodomites in the land  they did 
according to all the abominations of 
the nations which the lord drove out 
before the children of israel   first kings  
501 
 25and it came to pass in the fifth 
year of king rehoboam  that shishak 
king of egypt came up against 
jerusalem  26and he took away the 
treasures of the house of the lord and 
the treasures of the king s house  he 
even took away all  and he took away 
all the shields of gold which solomon 
had made  27and king rehoboam 
made in their stead shields of brass  
and committed them to the hands of 
the captains of the guard  who kept the 
door of the king s house  28and it w as 
so that as oft as the king went into the 
house of the lord the guard bore 
them  and brought them back into the 
guard chamber   
29now the rest of the acts of 
rehoboam  and all that he did  are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings  of judah  
30and there was war between 
rehoboam and jeroboam continually  
31and rehoboam slept with his 
fathers  and was buried with his fathers 
in the city of david  and his mother s 
name was naamah the ammonitess  
and abijam his son reigned in his 
stead   
now in the eighteenth year of 
king jeroboam the son of 
nebat began abijam to reign over 
judah  2three years reigned he in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
maacah the daughter of abishalom  
3and he walked in all the sins of his 
father  which he had  done before him  
and his heart was not whole with the 
lord his god  as the heart of david his father  4nevertheless for david s sake 
did the lord his god give him a lamp 
in jerusalem  to set up his son after 
him and to establish jerusalem  
5because david  did that which was 
right in the eyes of the lord and 
turned not aside from any thing that 
he commanded him all the days of his 
life save only in the matter of uriah 
the hittite  6now there was war 
between rehoboam and jeroboam all 
the days of his life   
7and the rest of the acts of abijam  
and all that he did  are they not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of judah  and there was war 
between abijam and jeroboam  8and 
abijam slept with his fathers  and they 
buried him in the city of david  and 
asa his son reigned in his stead   
9and in the twentieth year of 
jeroboam king of israel began asa to 
reign over judah  10and forty and one 
years reigned he in jerusalem  and his 
mother s name was maacah the 
daughter of abishalom  11and asa did 
that which was right in the eyes of the 
lord as did david his father  12and he 
put away the sodomites out of the 
land and removed all the idols that his 
fathers had made  13and also maacah 
his mother he removed from being 
queen  because she had made an 
abomin able image for an asherah  and 
asa cut down her image  and burnt it 
at the brook kidron  14but the high 
places were not taken away  
nevertheless the heart of asa was 
whole with the lord all his days  15 first kings  
502 
 15and he brought into the house of the 
lord the things t hat his father had 
hallowed  and the things that himself 
had hallowed  silver  and gold  and 
vessels   
16and there was war between asa 
and baasa king of israel all their days  
17and baasa king of israel went up 
against judah  and built ramah  that 
he might  not suffer any to go out or 
come in to asa king of judah  18then 
asa took all the silver and the gold 
that were left in the treasures of the 
house of the lord and the treasures of 
the king s house  and delivered them 
into the hand of his servants  and ki ng 
asa sent them to ben hadad  the son 
of tabrimmon  the son of hezion  king 
of aram  that dwelt at damascus  
saying  19there is a league between 
me and thee  between my father and 
thy father  behold  i have sent unto 
thee a present of silver and gold  go 
break thy league with baasa king of 
israel  that he may depart from me  
20and ben hadad hearkened unto king 
asa and sent the captains of his 
armies against the cities of israel  and 
smote ijon  and dan  and abel beth
maacah  and all chinneroth  with al l 
the land of naphtali  21and it came to 
pass when baasa heard thereof  that 
he left off building ramah  and dwelt 
in tirzah  22then king asa made a 
proclamation unto all judah  none was 
exempted  and they carried away the 
stones of ramah  and the timber 
thereof  wherewith baasa had builded  and king asa built therewith geba of 
benjamin  and mizpah   
23now the rest of all the acts of asa  
and all his might  and all that he did  
and the cities which he built  are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicl es of the kings of judah  but 
in the time of his old age he was 
diseased in his feet  24and asa slept 
with his fathers  and was buried with 
his fathers in the city of david his 
father  and jehoshaphat his son 
reigned in his stead   
25and nadab the son of j eroboam 
began to reign over israel in the 
second year of asa king of judah  and 
he reigned over israel two years  26and 
he did that which was evil in the sight 
of the lord and walked in the way of 
his father  and in his sin wherewith he 
made israel to sin  27and baasa the son 
of ahijah  of the house of issachar  
conspired against him  and baasa

belonged to the philistines  for nadab 
and all israel were laying siege to 
gibbethon  28even in the third year of 
asa king of judah di d baasa slay him  
and reigned in his stead  29and it came 
to pass that  as soon as he was king  he 
smote all the house of jeroboam  he 
left not to jeroboam any that breathed  
until he had destroyed him  according 
unto the saying of the lord which he 
spoke  by the hand of his servant 
ahijah the shilonite  30for the sins of 
jeroboam which he sinned  and 
wherewith he made israel to sin  
because of his provocation wherewith first kings  
503 
 he provoked the lord the god of 
israel   
31now the rest of the acts of nadab 
and all th at he did  are they not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of israel  32and there was war 
between asa and baasa king of israel

judah began baasa the son of ahijah 
to reign over all israel in tirzah  and 
reigned twenty and four years  34and 
he did that which was evil in the sight 
of the lord and walked in the way of 
jeroboam  and in his sin wherewith he 
made israel to sin   
and the word of the lord 
came to jehu the son of 
hanani against baasa  saying  
2forasmuch as i exalted thee out of 
the dust  and made thee prince over 
my people israel  and thou hast 
walked in the way of jeroboam  and 
hast made my people israel to sin  to 
provoke me with their sins  3behold  i 
will utterly sweep away baasa and his 
house  and i will make thy house like 
the house of jeroboam the son of 
nebat  4him that dieth of baasa in the 
city shall the dogs eat  and him that 
dieth of his in the field shall the fowls 
of the air eat   
5now the rest of the acts of baasa  
and what he did  and his might  are 
they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of israel  6and 
baasa slept with his fathers  and was 
buried in tirzah  and elah his son 
reigned in his stead   7and moreover by the hand of the 
prophet jehu the son of hanani came 
the word of the lord against baasa  
and against his house  both because of 
all the evil that he did in the sight of 
the lord to provoke him with the 
work of his hands  in being like the 
house of jeroboam  and because he 
smote him   
8in the twenty and sixth year of asa 
king of judah began elah the son of 
baasa to reign over israel in tirzah  
and reigned two years  9and his 
servant zimri  captain of half his 
chariots  conspired against him  now 
he was in tirzah  drinking himself 
drunk in the house of arza  who was 
over the household in tirzah  10and

sat o n his throne  that he smote all the 
house of baasa  he left him not a 
single man child  neither of his 
kinsfolks  nor of his friends  12thus did 
zimri destroy all the house of baasa  
according to the word of the lord 
which he spoke against baasa by jehu 
the prophet  13for all the sins of baasa  
and the sins of elah his son  which 
they sinned  and wherewith they made 
israel to sin  to provoke the lord the 
god of israel  with their vanities   
14now the rest of the acts of elah  
and all that he did  are they  not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of israel   16 first kings  
504 
 15in the twenty and seventh year of 
asa king of judah did zimri reign 
seven days in tirzah  now the people 
were encamped against gibbethon  
which belonged to the philistines  
16and the peo ple that were encamped 
heard say  zimri hath conspired  and 
hath also smitten the king  wherefore 
all israel made omri  the captain of the 
host king over israel that day in the 
camp  17and omri went up from 
gibbethon  and all israel with him  and 
they b esieged tirzah  18and it came to 
pass when zimri saw that the city was 
taken  that he went into the castle of 
the king s house  and burnt the king s 
house over him with fire  and died  
19for his sins which he sinned in doing 
that which was evil in the sig ht of the 
lord in walking in the way of 
jeroboam  and in his sin which he did  
to make israel to sin   
20now the rest of the acts of zimri  
and his treason that he wrought  are 
they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of israel   
21then  were the people of israel 
divided into two parts  half of the 
people followed tibni the son of 
ginath  to make him king  and half 
followed omri   
22but the people that followed omri 
prevailed against the people that 
followed tibni the son of ginath  so 
tibni died  and omri reigned  23in the 
thirty and first year of asa king of 
judah began omri to reign over israel  
and reigned twelve years  six years 
reigned he in tirzah  24and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two 
talents of silver  and he built on  the 
hill and called the name of the city 
which he built  after the name of 
shemer  the owner of the hill  samaria  
25and omri did that which was evil in 
the sight of the lord and dealt 
wickedly above all that were before 
him 26for he walked in all the way of 
jeroboam the son of nebat  and in his 
sins wherewith he made israel to sin  
to provoke the lord the god of israel  
with their vanities   
27now the rest of the acts of omri 
which he did  and his might that he 
showed  are they not written in the 
book  of the chronicles of the kings of 
israel  28and omri slept with his 
fathers  and was buried in samaria  
and ahab his son reigned in his stead   
29and in the thirty and eighth year 
of asa king of judah began ahab the 
son of omri to reign over israel  and 
ahab the son of omri reigned over 
israel in samaria twenty and two 
years  30and ahab the son of omri did 
that which was evil in the sight of the 
lord above all that were before him  
31and it came to pass  as if it had been 
a light thing for him to walk in t he sins 
of jeroboam the son of nebat  that he 
took to wife jezebel the daughter of 
ethbaal king of the zidonians  and 
went and served baal  and worshipped 
him 32and he reared up an altar for 
baal in the house of baal  which he 
had built in samaria  33and ahab 
made the asherah  and ahab did yet 
more to provoke the lord the god of first kings  
505 
 israel  than all the kings of israel that 
were before him   
34in his days did hiel the bethelite 
build jericho  with abiram his first 
born he laid the foundation thereof  
and with  his youngest son segub he set 
up the gates thereof  according to the 
word of the lord which he spoke by 
the hand of joshua the son of nun   
and elijah the tishbite  who 
was of the settlers of gilead  
said unto ahab  as the lord the god 
of israel  liveth before whom i stand  
there shall not be dew nor rain these 
years  but according to my word  
2and the word of the lord came unto 
him saying  3get thee hence  and turn 
thee eastward  and hide thyself by the 
brook cherith  that is before the 
jordan  4and it shall be  that thou shalt 
drink of the brook  and i have 
commanded the ravens to feed thee 
there  5so he went and did according 
unto the word of the lord for he went 
and dwelt by the brook cherith  that is 
before the jordan  6and the ravens 
broug ht him bread and flesh in the 
morning  and bread and flesh in the 
evening  and he drank of the brook  
7and it came to pass after a while  that 
the brook dried up  because there was 
no rain in the land   
8and the word of the lord came 
unto him  saying  9arise get thee to 
zarephath  which belongeth to zidon  
and dwell there  behold  i have 
commanded a widow there to sustain 
thee 10so he arose and went to 
zarephath  and when he came to the gate of the city  behold  a widow was 
there gathering sticks  and h e called to 
her and said  fetch me  i pray thee  a 
little water in a vessel  that i may 
drink  11and as she was going to fetch 
it he called to her  and said  bring 
me i pray thee  a morsel of bread in 
thy hand  12and she said  as the 
lord thy god l iveth  i have not a cake  
only a handful of meal in the jar  and a 
little oil in the cruse  and behold  i am 
gathering two sticks  that i may go in 
and dress it for me and my son  that 
we may eat it  and die  13and elijah 
said unto her  fear not  go and  do as 
thou hast said  but make me thereof a 
little cake first  and bring it forth unto 
me and afterward make for thee and 
for thy son  14for thus saith the lord 
the god of israel  the jar of meal shall 
not be spent  neither shall the cruse of 
oil fail  until the day that the lord 
sendeth rain upon the land  15and she 
went and did according to the saying 
of elijah  and she  and he  and her 
house  did eat many days  16the jar of 
meal was not spent  neither did the 
cruse of oil fail  according to the word 
of the lord which he spoke by elijah   
17and it came to pass after these 
things  that the son of the woman  the 
mistress of the house  fell sick  and his 
sickness was so sore  that there was no 
breath left in him  18and she said unto 
elijah  what have i to do with thee  o 
thou man of god  art thou come unto 
me to bring my sin to remembrance  
and to slay my son  19and he said 
unto her  give me thy son  and he 17 first kings  
506 
 took him out of her bosom  and carried 
him up into the upper chamber  where 
he abode  and laid him upon his own 
bed 20and he cried unto the lord and 
said o lord my god  hast thou also 
brought evil upon the widow with 
whom i sojourn  by slaying her son  
21and he stretched himself upon the 
child three times  and cried unto the 
lord and said  o lord my god  i 
pray thee  let this child s soul come 
back into him  22and the lord 
hearkened unto the voice of elijah  
and the soul of the child came back 
into him  and he revived  23and elijah 
took the child  and brought him down 
out of the upper chamber  into the 
house  and delivered him unto his 
mother  and elijah said  see thy son 
liveth  24and the woman said to 
elijah  now i know that thou art a 
man of god  and that the word of the 
lord in thy mouth is truth   
and it came to pass after many 
days that the word of the lord 
came to elijah  in the third year  
saying  go show thyself unto ahab  
and i will send rain upon the land  
2and elijah went to show himself unto 
ahab   
and the famine was sore in 
samaria  3and ahab called obadiah  
who was ove r the household now 
obadiah feared the lord greatly  4for 
it was so  when jezebel cut off the 
prophets of the lord that obadiah 
took a hundred prophets  and hid them 
fifty in a cave  and fed them with 
bread and water  5and ahab said unto obadiah  go th rough the land  
unto all the springs of water  and unto 
all the brooks  peradventure we may 
find grass and save the horses and 
mules alive  that we lose not all the 
beasts  6so they divided the land 
between them to pass throughout it  
ahab went one way by  himself  and 
obadiah went another way by himself   
7and as obadiah was in the way  
behold  elijah met him  and he knew 
him and fell on his face  and said  is 
it thou  my lord elijah  8and he 
answered him  it is i  go tell thy lord  
behold  elijah is here 9and he said  
wherein have i sinned  that thou 
wouldest deliver thy servant into the 
hand of ahab  to slay me  10as the 
lord thy god liveth  there is no nation 
or kingdom  whither my lord hath not 
sent to seek thee  and when they said  
he is not he re he took an oath of the 
kingdom and nation  that they found 
thee not  11and now thou sayest  go 
tell thy lord  behold  elijah is here  
12and it will come to pass  as soon as i 
am gone from thee  that the spirit of 
the lord will carry thee whither i 
know not  and so when i come and tell 
ahab  and he cannot find thee  he will 
slay me  but i thy servant fear the lord 
from my youth  13was it not told my 
lord what i did when jezebel slew the 
prophets of the lord how i hid a 
hundred men of the l ords prophet s 
by fifty in a cave  and fed them with 
bread and water  14and now thou 
sayest  go tell thy lord  behold  elijah 
is here  and he will slay me  15and 18 first kings  
507 
 elijah said  as the lord of hosts 
liveth  before whom i stand  i will 
surely show myself unto him to day  
16so obadiah went to meet ahab  
and told him  and ahab went to meet 
elijah  17and it came to pass  when 
ahab saw elijah  that ahab said unto 
him is it thou  thou troubler of 
israel  18and be answered  i have not 
troubled israel  but thou  and thy 
father s house  in that ye have forsaken 
the commandments of the lord and 
thou hast followed the baalim  19now 
therefore send  and gather to me all 
israel unto mount carmel  and the 
prophets of baal four hundred and 
fifty and the prophets of the asherah 
four hundred  that eat at jezebel s 
table   
20and ahab sent unto all the 
children of israel  and gathered the 
prophets together unto mount carmel  
21and elijah came near unto all the 
people  and said  how long halt ye 
between two opinions  if the lord be 
god follow him  but if baal  follow 
him and the people answered him 
not a word  22then said elijah unto the 
people  i even i only  am left a 
prophet of the lord but baal s 
prophets are four hundred and fifty 
men 23let them therefore give us two 
bullocks and let them choose one 
bullock for themselves  and cut it in 
pieces  and lay it on the wood  and put 
no fire under  and i will dress the other 
bullock  and lay it on the wood  and 
put no fire under  24and call ye on the 
name of your god  and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that 
answereth by fire  let him be god  
and all the people answered and said  
it is well spoken   
25and elijah said unto the prophets 
of baal  choose you one bullock for 
yourselves  and dress it first  for ye a re 
many  and call on the name of your 
god but put no fire under  26and they 
took the bullock which was given 
them  and they dressed it  and called 
on the name of baal from morning 
even until noon  saying  o baal  
answer us  but there was no voice  
nor any that answered  and they 
danced in halting wise about the altar 
which was made  27and it came to pass 
at noon  that elijah mocked them  and 
said cry aloud  for he is a god  either 
he is musing  or he is gone aside  or he 
is in a journey  or peradventu re he 
sleepeth  and must be awaked  28and 
they cried aloud  and cut themselves 
after their manner with swords and 
lances  till the blood gushed out upon 
them  29and it was so  when midday 
was past  that they prophesied until the 
time of the offering of th e evening 
offering  but their was neither voice  
nor any to answer  nor any that 
regarded   
30and elijah said unto all the 
people  come near unto me  and all 
the people came near unto him  and 
he repaired the altar of the lord that 
was thrown down  31and elijah took 
twelve stones  according to the number 
of the tribes of the sons of jacob  unto 
whom the word of the lord came  first kings  
508 
 saying  israel shall be thy name  
32and with the stones he built an altar 
in the name of the lord and he made 
a trench about the  altar as great as 
would contain two measures of seed  
33and he put the wood in order  and 
cut the bullock in pieces  and laid it on 
the wood  34and he said  fill four jars 
with water  and pour it on the burnt 
offering  and on the wood  and he 
said do it the second time  and they 
did it the second time  and he said  
do it the third time  and they did it 
the third time  35and the water ran 
round about the altar  and he filled the 
trench also with water  36and it came 
to pass at the time of the offeri ng of 
the evening offering  that elijah the 
prophet came near  and said  o lord 
the god of abraham  of isaac  and of 
israel  let it be known this day that 
thou art god in israel  and that i am 
thy servant  and that i have done all 
these things at thy wor d 37hear me  o 
lord hear me  that this people may 
know that thou  lord art god  for 
thou didst turn their heart backward  
38then the fire of the lord fell and 
consumed the burnt offering  and the 
wood  and the stones  and the dust  and 
licked up the w ater that was in the 
trench  39and when all the people saw 
it they fell on their faces  and they 
said the lord he is god  the lord 
he is god  40and elijah said unto 
them  take the prophets of baal  let 
not one of them escape  and they 
took them  and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon  and slew 
them there   
41and elijah said unto ahab  get 
thee up  eat and drink  for there is the 
sound of abundance of rain  42so 
ahab went up to eat and to drink  and 
elijah went up to the top of carmel  
and he bowed himself down upon the 
earth  and put his face between his 
knees  43and he said to his servant  
go up now  look toward the sea  and 
he went up  and looked  and said  
there is nothing  and he said  go 
again seven times  44and it came to 
pass at the seventh time  that he said  
behold  there ariseth a cloud out of 
the sea  as small as a man s hand  
and he said  go up  say unto ahab  
make ready thy chariot  and get thee 
down  that the rain stop thee not  
45and it came to pass in a little whi le 
that the heaven grew black with clouds 
and wind  and there was a great rain  
and ahab rode  and went to jezreel  
46and the hand of the lord was on 
elijah  and he girded up his loins  and 
ran before ahab to the entrance of 
jezreel   
and ahab told jez ebel all that 
elijah had done  and withal 
how he had slain all the prophets with 
the sword  2then jezebel sent a 
messenger unto elijah  saying  so let 
the gods do to me  and more also  if i 
make not thy life as the life of one of 
them by to morrow about  this time  
3and when he saw that  he arose  and 
went for his life  and came to beer 
sheba  which belongeth to judah  and 19 first kings  
509 
 left his servant there  4but he himself 
went a day s journey into the 
wilderness  and came and sat down 
under a broom tree and he re quested 
for himself that he might die  and said  
it is enough  now o lord take away 
my life  for i am not better than my 
fathers  5and he lay down and slept 
under a broom tree and behold  an 
angel touched him  and said unto him  
arise and eat  6and he looked  and 
behold  there was at his head a cake 
baked on the hot stones  and a cruse of 
water  and he did eat and drink  and 
laid him down again  7and the angel of 
the lord came again the second time  
and touched him  and said  arise and 
eat becaus e the journey is too great 
for thee  8and he arose  and did eat 
and drink  and went in the strength of 
that meal forty days and forty nights 
unto horeb the mount of god   
9and he came thither unto a cave  
and lodged there  and behold  the 
word of the lord came to him  and he 
said unto him  what doest thou here  
elijah  10and he said  i have been 
very jealous for the lord the god of 
hosts  for the children of israel have 
forsaken thy covenant  thrown down 
thine altars  and slain thy prophets 
with the s word  and i  even i only  am 
left and they seek my life  to take it 
away  11and he said  go forth  and 
stand upon the mount before the 
lord and behold  the lord passed 
by and a great and strong wind rent 
the mountains  and broke in pieces the 
rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind  and after the wind 
an earthquake  but the lord was not in 
the earthquake  12and after the 
earthquake a fire  but the lord was not 
in the fire  and after the fire a still 
small voice  13and it was so  when 
elijah heard it  that he wrapped his 
face in his mantle  and went out  and 
stood in the entrance of the cave  and 
behold  there came a voice unto him  
and said  what doest thou here  
elijah  14and he said  i have been 
very jealous for the lord the god  of 
hosts  for the children of israel have 
forsaken thy covenant  thrown down 
thine altars  and slain thy prophets 
with the sword  and i  even i only  am 
left and they seek my life  to take it 
away   
15and the lord said unto him  go 
return on thy way t o the wilderness of 
damascus  and when thou comest  
thou shalt anoint hazael to be king 
over aram  16and jehu the son of 
nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king 
over israel  and elisha the son of 
shaphat of abel meholah shalt thou 
anoint to be prophet in thy r oom 
17and it shall come to pass  that him 
that escapeth from the sword of hazael 
shall jehu slay  and him that escapeth 
from the sword of jehu shall elisha 
slay 18yet will i leave seven thousand 
in israel  all the knees which have not 
bowed unto baal  and every mouth 
which hath not kissed him   
19so he departed thence  and found 
elisha the son of shaphat  who was 
plowing  with twelve yoke of oxen first kings  
510 
 before him  and he with the twelfth  
and elijah passed over unto him  and 
cast his mantle upon him  20and he left 
the oxen  and ran after elijah  and said  
let me  i pray thee  kiss my father 
and my mother  and then i will follow 
thee and he said unto him  go back  
for what have i done to thee  21and 
he returned from following him  and 
took the yoke of oxen  and slew them  
and boiled their flesh with the 
instruments of the oxen  and gave unto 
the people  and they did eat  then he 
arose  and went after elijah  and 
ministered unto him   
and ben hadad the king of 
aram gathered all his host 
together  and there  were thirty and two 
kings with him  and horses and 
chariots  and he went up and besieged 
samaria  and fought against it  2and he 
sent messengers to ahab king of 
israel  into the city  3and said unto 
him thus saith ben hadad  thy 
silver and thy gold is m ine thy wives 
also and thy children  even the 
goodliest  are mine  4and the king of 
israel answered and said  it is 
according to thy saying  my lord  o 
king i am thine  and all that i have  
5and the messengers came again  and 
said thus speaketh ben hadad  
saying  i sent indeed unto thee  saying  
thou shalt deliver me thy silver  and 
thy gold  and thy wives  and thy 
children  6but i will send my servants 
unto thee tomorrow about this time  
and they shall search thy house  and 
the houses of thy servant s and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine 
eyes they shall put it in their hand  
and take it away   
7then the king of israel called all 
the elders of the land  and said  mark  
i pray you  and see how this man 
seeketh mischief  for he sent unto me 
for my wives  and for my children  and 
for my silver  and for my gold  and i 
denied him not  8and all the elders 
and all the people said unto him  
hearken thou not  neither consent  
9wherefore he said unto the 
messengers of ben hadad  tell my 
lord the king  all that thou didst send 
for to thy servant at the first i will do  
but this thing i may not do  and the 
messengers departed  and brought him 
back word  10and ben hadad sent unto 
him and said  the gods do so unto 
me and more also  if the dust of 
samaria shall suffice for handfuls for 
all the people that follow me  11and 
the king of israel answered and said  
tell him  let not him that girdeth on 
his armour boast himself as he that 
putteth it off  12and it came to pass  
when benhadad  heard this message  
as he was drinking  he and the kings  
in the booths  that he said unto his 
servants  set yourselves in array  
and they set themselves in array 
against the city   
13and behold  a prophet came near 
unto ahab king of israel  and said  
thus saith the lord hast thou seen 
all this great multitude  behold  i will 
deliver it into thy hand this day  and 
thou shalt know that i am the lord 20 first kings  
511 
 14and ahab said  by whom  and he 
said thus saith the lord by the 
young men of the princes of the 
provinces  then he said  who shall 
begin the battle  and he answered  
thou  15then he numbered the young 
men of the princes of the provinces  
and they were two hundred and thirty 
two and after them he numbered all 
the people  even all the children of 
israel  being seven thousand   
16and they went out at noon  but 
benhadad was drinking himself drunk 
in the booths  he and the kings  the 
thirty and two kings that helped him  
17and the young men of the princes of 
the provinces went out first  and ben 
hadad  sent out  and they told him  
saying  there are men come out from 
samaria  18and he said  whether 
they are come out for peace  take them 
alive  or whether they are come out for 
war take them alive  19so these went 
out of the city  the young men of the  
princes of the provinces  and the army 
which followed them  20and they slew 
every one his man  and the arameans 
fled and israel pursued them  and 
benhadad the king of aram escaped 
on a horse with horsemen  21and the 
king of israel went out  and smote th e 
horses and chariots  and slew the 
arameans with a great slaughter  
22and the prophet came near to the 
king of israel  and said unto him  go 
strengthen thyself  and mark  and see 
what thou doest  for at the return of the 
year the king of aram will come up 
against thee   23and the servants of the king of 
aram said unto him  their god is a 
god of the hills  therefore they were 
stronger than we  but let us fight 
against them in the plain  and surely 
we shall be stronger than they  24and 
do this thing  take the kings away  
every man out of his place  and put 
governors in their room  25and number 
thee an army  like the army that thou 
hast lost  horse for horse  and chariot 
for chariot  and we will fight against 
them in the plain  and surely we shall 
be stron ger than they  and he 
hearkened unto their voice  and did so   
26and it came to pass at the return of 
the year  that ben hadad mustered the 
arameans  and went up to aphek  to 
fight against israel  27and the children 
of israel were mustered  and were 
victu alled  and went against them  and 
the children of israel encamped before 
them like two little flocks of kids  but 
the arameans filled the country  28and 
a man of god came near and spoke 
unto the king of israel  and said  thus 
saith the lord because the a rameans 
have said  the lord is a god of the 
hills but he is not a god of the 
valleys  therefore will i deliver all this 
great multitude into thy hand  and ye 
shall know that i am the lord 29and 
they encamped one over against the 
other seven days  and so  it was  that in 
the seventh day the battle was joined  
and the children of israel slew of the 
arameans a hundred thousand 
footmen in one day  30but the rest fled 
to aphek  into the city  and the wall first kings  
512 
 fell upon twenty and seven thousand 
men that were left  and ben hadad 
fled and came into the city  into an 
inner chamber   
31and his servants said unto him  
behold now  we have heard that the 
kings of the house of israel are 
merciful kings  let us  we pray thee  
put sackcloth on our loins  and ropes 
upon our  heads  and go out to the king 
of israel  peradventure he will save thy 
life 32so they girded sackcloth on 
their loins  and put ropes on their 
heads  and came to the king of israel  
and said  thy servant ben hadad 
saith  i pray thee  let me live  and h e 
said is he yet alive  he is my 
brother  33now the men took it for a 
sign and hastened to catch it from 
him and they said  thy brother ben 
hadad  then he said  go ye  bring 
him then ben hadad came forth to 
him and he caused him to come up 
into his chariot  34and benhadad  
said unto him  the cities which my 
father took from thy father i will 
restore  and thou shalt make streets for 
thee in damascus  as my father made 
in samaria  and i  said ahab  will 
let thee go with this covenant  so he 
made a covenant with him  and let him 
go  
35and a certain man of the sons of 
the prophets said unto his fellow by 
the word of the lord smite me  i 
pray thee  and the man refused to 
smite him  36then said he unto him  
because thou hast not heartened to  
the voice of the lord behold  as soon as thou art departed from me  a lion 
shall slay thee  and as soon as he was 
departed from him  a lion found him  
and slew him  37then he found another 
man and said  smite me  i pray thee  
and the man smote him  smiting and 
wounding him  38so the prophet 
departed  and waited for the king by 
the way  and disguised himself with 
his headband over his eyes  39and as 
the king passed by  he cried unto the 
king and he said  thy servant went 
out into the midst of the bat tle and 
behold  a man turned aside  and 
brought a man unto me  and said  
keep this man  if by any means he be 
missing  then shall thy life be for his 
life or else thou shalt pay a talent of 
silver  40and as thy servant was busy 
here and there  he was go ne and the 
king of israel said unto him  so shall 
thy judgment be  thyself hast decided 
it 41and he hastened  and took the 
headband away from his eyes  and the 
king of israel discerned him that he 
was of the prophets  42and he said 
unto him  thus sai th the lord 
because thou hast let go out of thy 
hand the man whom i had devoted to 
destruction  therefore thy life shall go 
for his life  and thy people for his 
people  43and the king of israel went 
to his house sullen and displeased  and 
came to samaria   
and it came to pass after these 
things  that naboth the 
jezreelite had a vineyard  which was in 
jezreel  hard by the palace of ahab  
king of samaria  2and ahab spoke 21 first kings  
513 
 unto naboth  saying  give me thy 
vineyard  that i may have it for a 
garden of herbs  because it is near unto 
my house  and i will give thee for it a 
better vineyard than it  or if it seem 
good to thee  i will give thee the worth 
of it in money  3and naboth said to 
ahab  the lord forbid it me  that i 
should give the inheritance of my 
fathers unto thee  4and ahab came 
into his house sullen and displeased 
because of the word which naboth the 
jezreelite had spoken to him  for he 
had said  i will not give thee the 
inheritance of my fathers  and he laid 
him down upon his bed  and turned 
away his face  and would eat no bread   
5but jezebel his wife came to him  
and said unto him  why is thy spirit 
so sullen  that thou eatest no bread  
6and he said unto her  because i 
spoke unto naboth the jezreelite  and 
said unto him  give me thy vineya rd 
for money  or else  if it please thee  i 
will give thee another vineyard for it  
and he answered  i will not give thee 
my vineyard  7and jezebel his wife 
said unto him  dost thou now govern 
the kingdom of israel  arise  and eat 
bread  and let thy hear t be merry  i will 
give thee the vineyard of naboth the 
jezreelite  8so she wrote letters in 
ahab s name  and sealed them with his 
seal and sent the letters unto the elders 
and to the nobles that were in his city  
and that dwelt with naboth  9and she 
wrote in the letters  saying  proclaim 
a fast  and set naboth at the head of 
the people  10and set two men  base fellows  before him  and let them bear 
witness against him  saying  thou 
didst curse god and the king  and then 
carry him out  and stone him  that he 
die  
11and the men of his city  even the 
elders and the nobles who dwelt in his 
city did as jezebel had sent unto them  
according as it was written in the 
letters which she had sent unto them  
12they proclaimed a fast  and set 
naboth at the head of  the people  
13and the two men  the base fellows  
came in and sat before him  and the 
base fellows bore witness against him  
even against naboth  in the presence 
of the people  saying  naboth did 
curse god and the king  then they 
carried him forth out of  the city  and 
stoned him with stones  that he died  
14then they sent to jezebel  saying  
naboth is stoned  and is dead  15and 
it came to pass  when jezebel heard 
that naboth was stoned  and was dead  
that jezebel said to ahab  arise  take 
possession of  the vineyard of naboth 
the jezreelite  which he refused to give 
thee for money  for naboth is not 
alive  but dead  16and it came to pass  
when ahab heard that naboth was 
dead  that ahab rose up to go down to 
the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite  
to take  possession of it   
17and the word of the lord came to 
elijah the tishbite  saying  18arise  go 
down to meet ahab king of israel  who 
dwelleth in samaria  behold  he is in 
the vineyard of naboth  whither he is 
gone down to take possession of it  first kings  
514 
 19and tho u shalt speak unto him  
saying  thus saith the lord hast thou 
killed  and also taken possessions  and 
thou shalt speak unto him  saying  
thus saith the lord in the place 
where dogs licked the blood of naboth 
shall dogs lick thy blood  even thine  
20and ahab said to elijah  hast thou 
found me  o mine enemy  and he 
answered  i have found thee  because 
thou hast given thyself over to do that 
which is evil in the sight of the lord 
21behold  i will bring evil upon thee  
and will utterly sweep thee away  and 
will cut off from ahab every man 
child  and him that is shut up and him 
that is left at large in israel  22and i 
will make thy house like the house of 
jeroboam the son of nebat  and like 
the house of baasa the son of ahijah  
for the provocation wherewit h thou 
hast provoked me  and hast made 
israel to sin  23and of jezebel also 
spoke the lord saying  the dogs shall 
eat jezebel in the moat of jezreel  
24him that dieth of ahab in the city the 
dogs shall eat  and him that dieth in 
the field shall the fowls of the air eat  
25but there was none like unto ahab  
who did give himself over to do that 
which was evil in the sight of the 
lord whom jezebel his wife stirred 
up 26and he did very abominably in 
following idols  according to all that 
the amorites did  whom the lord cast 
out before the children of israel   
27and it came to pass  when ahab 
heard those words  that he rent his 
clothes  and put sackcloth upon his flesh  and fasted  and lay in sackcloth  
and went softy  28and the word of the 
lord came to elija h the tishbite  
saying  29seest thou how ahab 
humbleth himself before me  because 
he humbleth himself before me  i will 
not bring the evil in his days  but in his 
sons days will i bring the evil upon 
his house   
and they continued three 
years without  war between 
aram and israel  2and it came to pass 
in the third year  that jehoshaphat the 
king of judah came down to the king 
of israel  3and the king of israel said 
unto his servants  know ye that 
ramoth gilead is ours  and we are still  
and take it not  out of the hand of the 
king of aram  4and he said unto 
jehoshaphat  wilt thou go with me to 
battle to ramoth gilead  and 
jehoshaphat said to the king of israel  
i am as thou art  my people as thy 
people  my horses as thy horses   
5and jehoshaphat sai d unto the king 
of israel  inquire  i pray thee  at the 
word of the lord today  6then the 
king of israel gathered the prophets 
together  about four hundred men  and 
said unto them  shall i go against 
ramoth gilead to battle  or shall i 
forbear  and the y said  go up  for 
the lord will deliver it into the hand of 
the king  7but jehoshaphat said  is 
there not here besides a prophet of the 
lord that we might inquire of him  
8and the king of israel said unto 
jehoshaphat  there is yet one man by 
whom we  may inquire of the lord 22 first kings  
515 
 micaiah the son of imlah  but i hate 
him for he doth not prophesy good 
concerning me  but evil  and 
jehoshaphat said  let not the king say 
so 9then the king of israel called an 
officer  and said  fetch quickly 
micaiah the so n of imlah  10now the 
king of israel and jehoshaphat the king 
of judah sat each on his throne  
arrayed in their robes  in a threshing 
floor  at the entrance of the gate of 
samaria  and all the prophets 
prophesied before them  11and 
zedekiah the son of che naanah made 
him horns of iron  and said  thus 
saith the lord with these shalt thou 
gore the arameans  until they be 
consumed  12and all the prophets 
prophesied so  saying  go up to 
ramoth gilead  and prosper  for the 
lord will deliver it into the hand of the 
king  
13and the messenger that went to 
call micaiah spoke unto him  saying  
behold now  the words of the 
prophets declare good unto the king 
with one mouth  let thy word  i pray 
thee be like the word of one of them  
and speak thou good  14and m icaiah 
said as the lord liveth  what the 
lord saith unto me  that will i speak  
15and when he was come to the king  
the king said unto him  micaiah  shall 
we go to ramoth gilead to battle  or 
shall we forbear  and he answered 
him go up  and prosper  and the 
lord will deliver it into the hand of the 
king 16and the king said unto him  
how many times shall i adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but 
the truth in the name of the lord 
17and he said  i saw all israel 
scattered upon the mountain s as sheep 
that have no shepherd  and the lord 
said these have no master  let them 
return every man to his house in 
peace  18and the king of israel said to 
jehoshaphat  did i not tell thee that 
he would not prophesy good 
concerning me  but evil  19and he 
said therefore hear thou the word of 
the lord i saw the lord sitting on his 
throne  and all the host of heaven 
standing by him on his right hand and 
on his left  20and the lord said who 
shall entice ahab  that he may go up 
and fall at ramoth gilead  and one 
said on this manner  and another said  
on that manner  21and there came 
forth the spirit  and stood before the 
lord and said  i will entice him  
22and the lord said unto him  
wherewith  and he said  i will go 
forth  and will be a lying spirit i n the 
mouth of all his prophets  and he 
said thou shalt entice him  and shalt 
prevail also  go forth  and do so  
23now therefore  behold  the lord hath 
put a lying spirit in the mouth of all 
these thy prophets  and the lord hath 
spoken evil concerning the e  
24then zedekiah the son of 
chenaanah came near  and smote 
micaiah on the check  and said  
which way went the spirit of the 
lord from me to speak unto thee  
25and micaiah said  behold  thou 
shalt see on that day  when thou shalt first kings  
516 
 go into an inner cha mber to hide 
thyself  26and the king of israel said  
take micaiah  and carry him back 
unto amon the governor of the city  
and to joash the king s son  27and say  
thus saith the king  put this fellow in 
the prison  and feed him with scant 
bread and with s cant water  until i 
come in peace  28and micaiah said  
if thou return at all in peace  the lord 
hath not spoken by me  and he said  
hear  ye peoples  all of you   
29so the king of israel and 
jehoshaphat the king of judah went up 
to ramoth gilead  30and the king of 
israel said unto jehoshaphat  i will 
disguise myself  and go into the battle  
but put thou on thy robes  and the 
king of israel disguised himself  and 
went into the battle  31now the king of 
aram had commanded the thirty and 
two captains of  his chariots  saying  
fight neither with small nor great  
save only with the king of israel  
32and it came to pass  when the 
captains of the chariots saw 
jehoshaphat  that they said  surely it 
is the king of israel  and they turned 
aside to fight agai nst him  and 
jehoshaphat cried out  33and it came 
to pass  when the captains of the 
chariots saw that it was not the king of 
israel  that they turned back from 
pursuing him  34and a certain man 
drew his bow at a venture  and smote 
the king of israel betwee n the lower 
armour and the breastplate  wherefore 
he said unto the driver of his chariot  
turn thy hand  and carry me out of the host  for i am sore wounded  
35and the battle increased that day  
and the king was stayed up in his 
chariot against the arame ans and died 
at even  and the blood ran out of the 
wound into the bottom of the chariot  
36and there went a cry throughout the 
host about the going down of the sun  
saying  every man to his city  and 
every man to his country   
37so the king died  and wa s brought 
to samaria  and they buried the king in 
samaria  38and they washed the 
chariot by the pool of samaria  and the 
dogs licked up his blood  the harlots 
also washed themselves there  
according unto the word of the lord 
which he spoke   
39now the rest  of the acts of ahab  
and all that he did  and the ivory house 
which he built  and all the cities that he 
built are they not written in the book 
of the chronicles of the kings of israel  
40so ahab slept with his fathers  and 
ahaziah his son reigned in his  stead   
41and jehoshaphat the son of asa 
began to reign over judah in the fourth 
year of ahab king of israel  
42jehoshaphat was thirty and five years 
old when he began to reign  and he 
reigned twenty and five years in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
azubah the daughter of shilhi  43and 
he walked in all the way of asa his 
father  he turned not aside from it  
doing that which was right in the eyes 
of the lord 44howbeit the high places 
were not taken away  the people still 
sacrificed and offered in the high first kings  
517 
 places  45and jehoshaphat made peace 
with the king of israel   
46now the rest of the acts of 
jehoshaphat  and his might that he 
showed  and how he warred  are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of judah  
47and the remnant of t he sodomites 
that remained in the days of his father 
asa he put away out of the land  48 
and there was no king in edom  a 
deputy was king  49 jehoshaphat made 
ships of tarshish to go to ophir for 
gold but they went not  for the ships 
were broken at ezion geber  50then 
said ahaziah the son of ahab unto 
jehoshaphat  let my servants go with 
thy servants in the ships  but 
jehoshaphat would not  51and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers  and 
was buried with his fathers in the city 
of david his father  and jeh oram his 
son reigned in his stead   
52ahaziah the son of ahab began to 
reign over israel in samaria in the 
seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king 
of judah  and he reigned two years 
over israel  53and he did that which 
was evil in the sight of the lord and 
walked in the way of his father  and in 
the way of his mother  and in the way 
of jeroboam the son of nebat  wherein 
he made israel to sin  54and he served 
baal and worshipped him  and 
provoked the lord the god of israel  
according to all that his father h ad 
done   
518 
    
second kings  
 
and moab rebelled against israel 
after the death of ahab   
2and ahaziah fell down through the 
lattice in his upper chamber that was in 
samaria  and was sick  and he sent 
messengers  and said unto them  go 
inquire of ba alzebub the god of 
ekron whether i shall recover of this 
sickness  3but an angel of the lord 
said to elijah the tishbite  arise  go 
up to meet the messengers of the king 
of samaria  and say unto them  is it 
because there is no god in israel  that 
ye go to inquire of baal zebub the god 
of ekron  4now therefore thus saith 
the lord thou shalt not come down 
from the bed whither thou art gone up  
but shalt surely die  and elijah 
departed  5and the messengers 
returned unto him  and he said unto 
them  why is  it that ye are returned  
6and they said unto him  there came 
up a man to meet us  and said unto us  
go return unto the king that sent you  
and say unto him  thus saith the lord 
is it because there is no god in israel  
that thou sendest to inquire of b aal
zebub the god of ekron  therefore 
thou shalt not come down from the bed 
whither thou art gone up  but shalt 
surely die  7and he said unto them  
what manner of man was he that 
came up to meet you  and told you 
these words  8and they answered him he was a hairy man  and girt 
with a girdle of leather about his 
loins  and he said  it is elijah the 
tishbite   
9then the king sent unto him a 
captain of fifty with his fifty  and he 
went up to him  and behold  he sat on 
the top of the hill  and he spoke  unto 
him o man of god  the king hath 
said come down  10and elijah 
answered and said to the captain of 
fifty if i be a man of god  let fire 
come down from heaven  and consume 
thee and thy fifty  and there came 
down fire from heaven  and consumed 
him and his fifty  11and again he sent 
unto him another captain of fifty with 
his fifty  and he answered and said 
unto him  o man of god  thus hath 
the king said  come down quickly  
12and elijah answered and said unto 
them  if i be a man of god  let fire 
come down from heaven  and consume 
thee and thy fifty  and the fire of god 
came down from heaven  and 
consumed him and his fifty  13and 
again he sent the captain of a third 
fifty with his fifty  and the third 
captain of fifty went up  and came and 
fell on his knees before elijah  and 
besought him  and said unto him  o 
man of god  i pray thee  let my life  
and the life of these fifty thy servants  
be precious in thy sight  14behold  1 second kings  
519 
 there came fire down from heaven  and 
consumed the two former captains of 
fifty with their fifties  but now let my 
life be precious in thy sight 15and the 
angel of the lord said unto elijah  go 
down with him  be not afraid of him  
and he arose  and went down with 
him unto the king  16and he said unto 
him thus saith the lord forasmuch 
as thou hast sent messengers to inquire 
of baal zebub the god of ekron  is it 
because there is no god in israel to 
inquire of his word  therefore thou 
shalt not come down from the bed 
whether thou art gone up  but shalt 
surely die   
17so he died  according to the word 
of the lord which elijah had spoken  
and jehoram began to reign in his 
stead in the second year of jehoram 
the son of jehoshaphat king of judah  
because he had no son  18now the rest 
of the acts of ahaziah which he did  
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of israel   
 
and it came to pass  when the 
lord would take up elijah by a 
whirlwind into heaven  that elijah 
went with elisha from gilgal  2and 
elijah said unto elisha  tarry here  i 
pray thee  for the lord hath sent me as 
far as beth el and elisha said  as 
the lord liveth  and as thy soul liveth  
i will not leave thee  so they went 
down to beth el 3and the sons of 
the prophets that were at beth el came 
forth to elisha  and said unto him  
knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to 
day and he said  yea i know it  
hold ye your peace  4and elijah 
said unto him  elisha  tarry here  i 
pray thee  for the lord hath sent me to 
jericho  and he said  as the lord 
liveth  and as thy soul liveth  i will not 
leave thee  so they came to jericho  
5and the sons of the prophets that 
were at jericho came near to elisha  
and said unto him  knowest thou that 
the lord will take away thy master 
from thy head to day and he 
answered  yea i know it  hold ye 
your peace  6and elijah said unto 
him tarry here  i pray thee  for the 
lord hath sent me to the jordan  and 
he said  as the lord liveth  and as thy 
soul liveth  i will not leave thee  and 
they two went on   
7and fifty men o f the sons of the 
prophets went  and stood over against 
them afar off  and they two stood by 
the jordan  8and elijah took his 
mantle  and wrapped it together  and 
smote the waters  and they were 
divided hither and thither  so that they 
two went over on dry  ground  9and it 
came to pass  when they were gone 
over that elijah said unto elisha  ask 
what i shall do for thee  before i am 
taken from thee  and elisha said  i 
pray thee  let a double portion of thy 
spirit be upon me  10and he said  
thou hast ask ed a hard thing  
nevertheless  if thou see me when i am 
taken from thee  it shall be so unto 
thee but if not  it shall not be so  
11and it came to pass  as they still 2 second kings  
520 
 went on  and talked  that behold  there 
appeared a chariot of fire  and horses 
of fire  which parted them both 
assunder  and elijah went up by a 
whirlwind into heaven   
12and elisha saw it  and he cried  
my father  my father  the chariots of 
israel and the horsemen thereof   and 
he saw him no more  and he took hold 
of his own clothes  and rent them in 
two pieces  13he took up also the 
mantle of elijah that fell from him  
and went back  and stood by the bank 
of the jordan  14and he took the 
mantle of elijah that fell from him  
and smote the waters  and said  
where is the lord the god of 
elijah and when he also had smitten 
the waters  they were divided hither 
and thither  and elisha went over   
15and when the sons of the prophets 
that were at jericho some way off saw 
him they said  the spirit of elijah 
doth rest on elisha  and they cam e to 
meet him  and bowed down to the 
ground before him  16and they said 
unto him  behold now  there are with 
thy servants fifty strong men  let them 
go we pray thee  and seek thy master  
lest peradventure the spirit of the lord 
hath taken him up  and cas t him upon 
some mountain  or into some valley  
and he said  ye shall not send  
17and when they urged him till he was 
ashamed  he said  send they sent 
therefore fifty men  and they sought 
three days  but found him not  18and 
they came back to him  while he 
tarried at jericho  and he said unto them  did i not say unto you  go 
not  
19and the men of the city said unto 
elisha  behold  we pray thee  the 
situation of this city is pleasant  as my 
lord seeth  but the water is bad  and the 
land miscarrieth  20and he said  bring 
me a new cruse  and put salt therein  
and they brought it to him  21and he 
went forth unto the spring of the 
waters  and cast salt therein  and said  
thus saith the lord i have healed 
these waters  there shall not be from 
thence a ny more death or 
miscarrying  22so the waters were 
healed unto this day  according to the 
word of elisha which he spoke   
23and he went up from thence unto 
beth el and as he was going up by the 
way there came forth little children 
out of the city  and m ocked him  and 
said unto him  go up  thou baldhead  
go up  thou baldhead  24and he 
looked behind him and saw them  and 
cursed them in the name of the lord 
and there came forth two she bears 
out of the wood  and tore forty and two 
children of them  25and he went from 
thence to mount carmel  and from 
thence he returned to samaria   
now jehoram the son of ahab 
began to reign over israel in 
samaria in the eighteenth year of 
jehoshaphat king of judah  and 
reigned twelve years  2and he did that 
which was evi l in the sight of the 
lord but not like his father  and like 
his mother  for he put away the pillar 
of baal that his father had made  3 second kings  
521 
 3nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins 
of jeroboam the son of nebat  
wherewith he made israel to sin  he 
departed not the refrom   
4now mesha king of moab was a 
sheep master  and he rendered unto the 
king of israel the wool of a hundred 
thousand lambs  and of a hundred 
thousand rams  5but it came to pass  
when ahab was dead  that the king of 
moab rebelled against the king of 
israel  6and king jehoram went out of 
samaria at that time  and mustered all 
israel  7and he went and sent to 
jehoshaphat the king of judah  saying  
the king of moab hath rebelled 
against me  wilt thou go with me 
against moab to battle  and he said  
i will go up  i am as thou art  my 
people as thy people  my horses as thy 
horses  8and he said  which way 
shall we go up  and he answered  
the way of the wilderness of edom  
9so the king of israel went  and the 
king of judah  and the king of edom  
and th ey made a circuit of seven 
daysjourney  and there was no water 
for the host  nor for the beasts that 
followed them  10and the king of 
israel said  alas for the lord hath 
called these three kings together to 
deliver them into the hand of moab  
11but jeh oshaphat said  is there not 
here a prophet of the lord that we 
may inquire of the lord by him  and 
one of the king of israel s servants 
answered and said  elisha the son of 
shaphat is here  who poured water on 
the hands of elijah  12and jehoshaphat sa id the word of the 
lord is with him  so the king of 
israel and jehoshaphat and the king of 
edom went down to him   
13and elisha said unto the king of 
israel  what have i to do with thee  
get thee to the prophets of thy father  
and to the prophets of th y mother  
and the king of israel said unto him  
nay for the lord hath called these 
three kings together to deliver them 
into the hand of moab  14and elisha 
said as the lord of hosts liveth  
before whom i stand  surely  were it 
not that i regard the p resence of 
jehoshaphat the king of judah  i would 
not look toward thee  nor see thee  
15but now bring me a minstrel  and it 
came to pass  when the minstrel 
played  that the hand of the lord came 
upon him  16and he said  thus saith 
the lord make this val ley full of 
trenches  17for thus saith the lord ye 
shall not see wind  neither shall ye see 
rain yet that valley shall be filled with 
water  and ye shall drink  both ye and 
your cattle and your beasts  18and this 
is but a light thing in the sight of the 
lord he will also deliver the 
moabites into your hand  19and ye 
shall smite every fortified city  and 
every choice city  and shall fell every 
good tree  and stop all fountains of 
water  and mar every good piece of 
land with stones  20and it came to 
pass in the morning  about the time of 
making the offering  that behold  there 
came water by the way of edom  and 
the country was filled with water   second kings  
522 
 21now when all the moabites heard 
that the kings were come up to fight 
against them  they gathered themselves 
together  all that were able to put on 
armour  and upward  and stood on the 
border  22and they rose up early in the 
morning  and the sun shone upon the 
water  and the moabites saw the water 
some way off as red as blood  23and 
they said  this is blood  the kings 
have surely fought together  and they 
have smitten each man his fellow  now 
therefore  moab  to the spoil  24and 
when they came to the camp of israel  
the israelites rose up and smote the 
moabites  so that they fled before 
them  and they smote the land even 
moab  mightily  25and they beat down 
the cities  and on every good piece of 
land they cast every man his stone  and 
filled it  and they stopped all the 
fountains of water  and felled all the 
good trees  until there was left only 
kirhareseth wit h the stones of the 
wall thereof  so the slingers 
encompassed it  and smote it  26and 
when the king of moab saw that the 
battle was too sore for him  he took 
with him seven hundred men that drew 
sword  to break through unto the king 
of edom  but they could  not 27then he 
took his eldest son that should have 
reigned in his stead  and offered him 
for a burnt offering upon the wall  and 
there came great wrath upon israel  
and they departed from him  and 
returned to their own land   
now there cried a certain woman 
of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha  saying  thy 
servant my husband is dead  and thou 
knowest that thy servant did fear the 
lord and the creditor is come to take 
unto him my two children to be 
bondmen  2and elisha said unto her  
what shall i do for thee  tell me  
what hast thou in the house  and she 
said thy handmaid hath not any 
thing in the house  save a pot of oil  
3then he said  go borrow thee 
vessels abroad of all thy neighbours  
even empty vessels  borrow not a few  
4and thou shalt go in  and shut the 
door upon thee and upon thy sons  and 
pour out into all those vessels  and 
thou shalt set aside that which is full  
5so she went from him  and shut the 
door upon her and upon her sons  they 
brought the vessels to her  and she 
poured out  6and it came to pass  when 
the vessels were full  that she said unto 
her son  bring me yet a vessel  and 
he said unto her  there is not a vessel 
more  and the oil stayed  7then she 
came and told the man of god  and he 
said go sell t he oil  and pay thy 
debt and live thou and thy sons of the 
rest  
8and it fell on a day  that elisha 
passed to shunem  where was a great 
woman  and she constrained him to eat 
bread  and so it was  that as oft as he 
passed by  he turned in thither to eat 
bread  9and she said unto her husband  
behold now  i perceive that this is a 
holy man of god  that passeth by us 
continually  10let us make  i pray thee  
a little chamber on the roof  and let us 4 second kings  
523 
 set for him there a bed  and a table  
and a stool  and a can dlestick  and it 
shall be  when he cometh to us  that he 
shall turn in thither  11and it fell on a 
day that he came thither  and he 
turned into the upper chamber and lay 
there  12and he said to gehazi his 
servant  call this shunammite  and 
when he had called her  she stood 
before him  13and he said unto him  
say now unto her  behold  thou hast 
been careful for us with all this care  
what is to be done for thee  wouldest 
thou be spoken for to the king  or to 
the captain of the host  and she 
answered  i dwell among mine own 
people  14and he said  what then is 
to be done for her  and gehazi 
answered  verily she hath no son  and 
her husband is old  15and he said  
call her  and when he had called 
her she stood in the door  16and he 
said at this s eason  when the time 
cometh round  thou shalt embrace a 
son and she said  nay my lord  
thou man of god  do not lie unto thy 
handmaid  17and the woman 
conceived  and bore a son at that 
season  when the time came round  as 
elisha had said unto her   
18and when the child was grown  it 
fell on a day  that he went out to his 
father to the reapers  19and he said 
unto his father  my head  my head  
and he said to his servant  carry him 
to his mother  20and when he had 
taken him  and brought him to his 
moth er he sat on her knees till noon  
and then died  21and she went up  and laid him on the bed of the man of god  
and shut the door upon him  and went 
out 22and she called unto her 
husband  and said  send me  i pray 
thee one of the servants  and one of 
the asses  that i may run to the man of 
god and come back  23and he said  
wherefore wilt thou go to him today  
it is neither new moon nor sabbath  
and she said  it shall be well  24then 
she saddled an ass  and said to her 
servant  drive  and go forward  
slacken me not the riding  except i bid 
thee 25so she went  and came unto 
the man of god to mount carmel   
and it came to pass  when the man 
of god saw her afar off  that he said to 
gehazi his servant  behold  yonder is 
that shunammite  26run i pray thee 
now to meet her  and say unto her  is it 
well with thee  is it well with thy 
husband  is it well with the child  
and she answered  it is well  27and 
when she came to the man of god to 
the hill  she caught hold of his feet  
and gehazi came near to thrust her 
away  but the man of god said  let 
her alone  for her soul is bitter within 
her and the lord hath hid it from me  
and hath not told me  28then she said  
did i desire a son of my lord  did i 
not say  do not deceive me  29then 
he said to geha zi gird up thy loins  
and take my staff in thy hand  and go 
thy way  if thou meet any man  salute 
him not  and if any salute thee  answer 
him not  and lay my staff upon the 
face of the child  30and the mother of 
the child said  as the lord liveth  and second kings  
524 
 as thy soul liveth  i will not leave 
thee and he arose  and followed her  
31and gehazi passed on before them  
and laid the staff upon the face of the 
child  but there was neither voice  nor 
hearing  wherefore he returned to 
meet him  and told him  saying  the 
child is not awaked   
32and when elisha was come into 
the house  behold  the child was dead  
and laid upon his bed  33he went in 
therefore  and shut the door upon them 
twain  and prayed unto the lord 
34and he went up  and lay upon the 
child  and p ut his mouth upon his 
mouth  and his eyes upon his eyes  and 
his hands upon his hands  and he 
stretched himself upon him  and the 
flesh of the child waxed warm  35then 
he returned  and walked in the house 
once to and fro  and went up  and 
stretched himself  upon him  and the 
child sneezed seven times  and the 
child opened his eyes  36and he called 
gehazi  and said  call this 
shunammite  so he called her  and 
when she was come in unto him  he 
said take up thy son  37then she 
went in  and fell at his feet  and bowed 
down to the ground  and she took up 
her son  and went out   
38and elisha came again to gilgal  
and there was a dearth in the land  and 
the sons of the prophets were sitting 
before him  and he said unto his 
servant  set on the great pot  and 
seethe pottage for the sons of the 
prophets  39and one went out into the 
field to gather herbs  and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds 
his lap full  and came and shred them 
into the pot of pottage  for they knew 
them not  40so they poured o ut for the 
men to eat  and it came to pass  as 
they were eating of the pottage  that 
they cried out  and said  o man of 
god there is death in the pot  and 
they could not eat thereof  41but he 
said then bring meal  and he cast it 
into the pot  and he said pour out for 
the people  that they may eat  and 
there was no harm in the pot   
42and there came a man from baal 
shalishah  and brought the man of god 
bread of the first fruits  twenty loaves 
of barley  and fresh ears of corn in his 
sack and he sai d give unto the 
people  that they may eat  43and his 
servant said  how should i set this 
before a hundred men  but he said  
give the people  that they may eat  
for thus saith the lord they shall eat  
and shall leave thereof  44so he set it 
before t hem and they did eat  and left 
thereof  according to the word of the 
lord  
now naaman  captain of the host 
of the king of aram  was a great 
man with his master  and held in 
esteem  because by him the lord had 
given victory unto aram  he was also a 
migh ty man of valour  but he was a 
leper  2and the arameans had gone 
out in bands  and had brought away 
captive out of the land of israel a little 
maid  and she waited on naaman s 
wife 3and she said unto her mistress  
would that my lord were with the 5 second kings  
525 
 prophet  that is in samaria  then would 
he recover him of his leprosy  4and 
he went in  and told his lord  saying  
thus and thus said the maid that is of 
the land of israel  5and the king of 
aram said  go now  and i will send a 
letter unto the king of israel  and he 
departed  and took with him ten talents 
of silver  and six thousand pieces of 
gold and ten changes of raiment  6and 
he brought the letter to the king of 
israel  saying  and now when this 
letter is come unto thee  behold  i have 
sent naaman my ser vant to thee  that 
thou mayest recover him of his 
leprosy  7and it came to pass  when 
the king of israel had read the letter  
that he rent his clothes  and said  am 
i god  to kill and to make alive  that 
this man doth send unto me to recover 
a man of his  leprosy  but consider  i 
pray you  and see how he seeketh an 
occasion against me   
8and it was so  when elisha the man 
of god heard that the king of israel 
had rent his clothes  that he sent to the 
king saying  wherefore hast thou 
rent thy clothes  let him come now to 
me and he shall know that there is a 
prophet in israel  9so naaman came 
with his horses and with his chariots  
and stood at the door of the house of 
elisha  10and elisha sent a messenger 
unto him  saying  go and wash in the 
jordan seven  times  and thy flesh shall 
come back to thee  and thou shalt be 
clean  11but naaman was wroth  and 
went away  and said  behold  i 
thought  he will surely come out to me and stand  and call on the name of 
the lord his god  and wave his hand 
over the pla ce and recover the leper  
12are not amanah and pharpar  the 
rivers of damascus  better than all the 
waters of israel  may i not wash in 
them  and be clean  so he turned  and 
went away in a rage  13and his 
servants came near  and spoke unto 
him and said  my father  if the 
prophet had bid thee do some great 
thing  wouldest thou not have done it  
how much rather then  when he saith 
to thee  wash  and be clean  14then 
went he down  and dipped himself 
seven times in the jordan  according to 
the saying of th e man of god  and his 
flesh came back like unto the flesh of a 
little child  and he was clean   
15and he returned to the man of 
god he and all his company  and 
came  and stood before him  and he 
said behold now  i know that there is 
no god in all the ea rth but in israel  
now therefore  i pray thee  take a 
present of thy servant  16but he said  
as the lord liveth  before whom i 
stand  i will receive none  and he 
urged him to take it  but he refused  
17and naaman said  if not  yet i pray 
thee let ther e be given to thy servant 
two mules burden of earth  for thy 
servant will henceforth offer neither 
burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other 
gods  but unto the lord 18in this thing 
the lord pardon thy servant  when my 
master goeth into the house of 
rimmon t o worship there  and he 
leaneth on my hand  and i prostrate second kings  
526 
 myself in the house of rimmon  when 
i prostrate myself in the house of 
rimmon  the lord pardon thy servant 
in this thing  19and he said unto him  
go in peace  so he departed from 
him some way   
20but gehazi  the servant of elisha 
the man of god  said behold  my 
master hath spared this naaman the 
aramean  in not receiving at his hands 
that which he brought  as the lord 
liveth  i will surely run after him  and 
take somewhat of him  21so gehazi 
followed after naaman  and when 
naaman saw one running after him  he 
alighted from the chariot to meet him  
and said  is all well  22and he said  
all is well  my master hath sent me  
saying  behold  even now there are 
come to me from the hill country of  
ephraim two young men of the sons of 
the prophets  give them  i pray thee  a 
talent of silver  and two changes of 
raiment  23and naaman said  be 
content  take two talents  and he 
urged him  and bound two talents of 
silver in two bags  with two changes of 
raiment  and laid them upon two of his 
servants  and they bore them before 
him 24and when he came to the hill  
he took them from their hand  and 
deposited them in the house  and he let 
the men go  and they departed  25but 
he went in  and stood before h is 
master  and elisha said unto him  
whence comest thou  gehazi  and 
he said  thy servant went no 
whither  26and he said unto him  
went not my heart with thee  when the man turned back from his chariot 
to meet thee  is it a time to receive 
money  and to receive garments  and 
oliveyards and vineyards  and sheep 
and oxen  and men servants and maid 
servants  27the leprosy therefore of 
naaman shall cleave unto thee  and 
unto thy seed for ever  and he went 
out from his presence a leper as white 
as snow   
and the sons of the prophets said 
unto elisha  behold now  the 
place where we dwell before thee is 
too strait for us  2let us go  we pray 
thee unto the jordan  and take thence 
every man a beam  and let us make us 
a place there  where we may dwell  
and he answered  go ye  3and one 
said be content  i pray thee  and go 
with thy servants  and he answered  
i will go  4so he went with them  
and when they came to the jordan  
they cut down wood  5but as one was 
felling a beam  the axe head fell into 
the water  and he cried  and said  
alas my master  for it was 
borrowed  6and the man of god said  
where fell it  and he showed him 
the place  and he cut down a stick  
and cast it in thither  and made the iron 
to swim  7and he said  take it up to 
thee so he put out his hand  and took 
it  
8now the king of aram warred 
against israel  and he took counsel 
with his servants  saying  in such and 
such a place shall be my camp  9and 
the man of god sent unto the king of 
israel  saying  beware that thou pass  6 second kings  
527 
 not such a place  for thither the 
arameans are coming down  10and 
the king of israel sent to the place 
which the man of god told him and 
warned him of  and he guarded 
himself there  not once nor twice  
11and the heart of the king of aram 
was sore trouble d for this thing  and he 
called his servants  and said unto them  
will ye not tell me which of us is for 
the king of israel  12and one of his 
servants said  nay my lord  o king  
but elisha  the prophet that is in israel  
telleth the king of israel the words that 
thou speakest in thy bed chamber  
13and he said  go and see where he 
is that i may send and fetch him  and 
it was told him  saying  behold  he is 
in dothan   
14therefore sent he thither horses  
and chariots  and a great host  and they 
came  by night  and compassed the city 
about  15and when the servant of the 
man of god was risen early  and gone 
forth  behold  a host with horses and 
chariots was round about the city  and 
his servant said unto him  alas my 
master  how shall we do  16and he  
answered  fear not  for they that are 
with us are more than they that are 
with them  17and elisha prayed  and 
said lord i pray thee  open his 
eyes that he may see  and the lord 
opened the eyes of the young man  and 
he saw  and behold  the mountain  was 
full of horses and chariots of fire round 
about elisha  18and when they came 
down to him  elisha prayed unto the 
lord and said  smite this people  i pray thee  with blindness  and he 
smote them with blindness according 
to the word of elisha  19and elisha 
said unto them  this is not the way  
neither is this the city  follow me  and 
i will bring you to the man whom ye 
seek and he led them to samaria   
20and it came to pass  when they 
were come into samaria  that elisha 
said lord open the eyes of  these 
men that they may see  and the lord 
opened their eyes  and they saw  and 
behold  they were in the midst of 
samaria  21and the king of israel said 
unto elisha  when he saw them  my 
father  shall i smite them  shall i smite 
them  22and he answere d thou 
shalt not smite them  hast thou taken 
captive with thy sword and with thy 
bow those whom thou wouldest smite  
set bread and water before them  that 
they may eat and drink  and go to their 
master  23and he prepared great 
provision for them  and wh en they had 
eaten and drunk  he sent them away  
and they went to their master  and the 
bands of aram came no more into the 
land of israel   
24and it came to pass after this  that 
benhadad king of aram gathered all 
his host  and went up  and besieged 
samar ia 25and there was a great 
famine in samaria  and behold  they 
besieged it  until an ass s head was 
sold for fourscore pieces of silver  and 
the fourth part of a kab of dove s dung 
for five pieces of silver  26and as the 
king of israel was passing by upo n the 
wall there cried a woman unto him  second kings  
528 
 saying  help  my lord  o king  27and 
he said  if the lord do not help thee  
whence shall i help thee  out of the 
threshingfloor  or out of the 
winepress  28and the king said unto 
her what aileth thee  and sh e 
answered  this woman said unto me  
give thy son  that we may eat him to 
day and we will eat my son to 
morrow  29so we boiled my son  and 
did eat him  and i said unto her on the 
next day  give thy son  that we may 
eat him  and she hath hid her son  
30and it came to pass  when the king 
heard the words of the woman  that he 
rent his clothes now he was passing 
by upon the wall and the people 
looked  and behold  he had sackcloth 
within upon his flesh  31then he said  
god do so to me  and more also  if the  
head of elisha the son of shaphat shall 
stand on him this day   
32but elisha sat in his house  and the 
elders sat with him  and the king sent a 
man from before him  but ere the 
messenger came to him  he said to the 
elders  see ye how this son of a 
murde rer hath sent to take away my 
head  look when the messenger 
cometh  shut the door  and hold the 
door fast against him  is not the sound 
of his master s feet behind him  
33and while he yet talked with them  
behold  the messenger came down 
unto him  and the king  said behold  
this evil is  of the lord why should i  
wait for  the lord any longer   
and elisha said  hear ye the 
word of the lord thus saith the lord tomorrow about this time shall 
a measure of fine flour be sold for a 
shekel  and two meas ures of barley for 
a shekel  in the gate of samaria  
2then the captain on whose hand the 
king leaned answered the man of god  
and said  behold  if the lord should 
make windows in heaven  might this 
thing be  and he said  behold  thou 
shalt see it with thine eyes  but shalt 
not eat thereof   
3now there were four leprous men 
at the entrance of the gate  and they 
said one to another  why sit we here 
until we die  4if we say  we will enter 
into the city  then the famine is in the 
city and we shall die th ere and if we 
sit still here  we die also  now 
therefore come  and let us fall unto the 
host of the arameans  if they save us 
alive  we shall live  and if they kill us  
we shall but die  5and they rose up in 
the twilight  to go unto the camp of the 
arame ans and when they were come 
to the outermost part of the camp of 
the arameans  behold  there was no 
man there  6for the lord had made the 
host of the arameans to hear a noise of 
chariots  and a noise of horses  even 
the noise of a great host  and they sai d 
one to another  lo the king of israel 
hath hired against us the kings of the 
hittites  and the kings of the 
egyptians  to come upon us  
7wherefore they arose and fled in the 
twilight  and left their tents  and their 
horses  and their asses  even the c amp 
as it was  and fled for their life  8and 
when these lepers came to the 7 second kings  
529 
 outermost part of the camp  they went 
into one tent  and did eat and drink  
and carried thence silver  and gold  
and raiment  and went and hid it  and 
they came back  and entered in to 
another tent  and carried thence also  
and went and hid it   
9then they said one to another  we 
do not well  this day is a day of good 
tidings  and we hold our peace  if we 
tarry till the morning light  punishment 
will overtake us  now therefore come  
let us go and tell the king s 
household  10so they came and called 
unto the porters of the city  and they 
told them  saying  we came to the 
camp of the arameans  and behold  
there was no man there  neither voice 
of man  but the horses tied  and the 
asses tied  and the tents as they were  
11and the porters called  and they told 
it to the king s household within  
12and the king arose in the night  and 
said unto his servants  i will now tell 
you what the arameans have done to 
us they know that we are hun gry 
therefore are they gone out of the 
camp to hide themselves in the field  
saying  when they come out of the 
city we shall take them alive  and get 
into the city  13and one of his servants 
answered and said  let some take  i 
pray thee  five of the ho rses that 
remain  which are left in the city  
behold  they are as all the multitude of 
israel that are left in it  behold  they 
are as all the multitude of israel that 
are consumed and let us send and 
see 14they took therefore two chariots with horses  and the king sent 
after the host of the arameans  saying  
go and see  15and they went after 
them unto the jordan  and lo all the 
way was full of garments and vessels  
which the arameans had cast away in 
their haste  and the messengers 
returned  and told  the king   
16and the people went out  and 
spoiled the camp of the arameans  so 
a measure of fine flour was sold for a 
shekel  and two measures of barley for 
a shekel  according to the word of the 
lord 17and the king appointed the 
captain on whose hand he  leaned to 
have the charge of the gate  and the 
people trod upon him in the gate  and 
he died as the man of god had said  
who spoke when the king came down 
to him  18and it came to pass  as the 
man of god had spoken to the king  
saying  two measures of ba rley for a 
shekel  and a measure of fine flour for 
a shekel  shall be to morrow about this 
time in the gate of samaria  19and that 
captain answered the man of god  and 
said now  behold  if the lord should 
make windows in heaven  might such 
a thing be  and he said  behold  thou 
shalt see it with thine eyes  but shalt 
not eat thereof  20it came to pass even 
so unto him  for the people trod upon 
him in the gate  and he died   
now elisha had spoken unto the 
woman  whose son he had 
restored to life  saying arise  and go 
thou and thy household  and sojourn 
wheresoever thou canst sojourn  for 
the lord hath called for a famine  and 8 second kings  
530 
 it shall also come upon the land seven 
years  2and the woman arose  and did 
according to the word of the man of 
god and she went with her household  
and sojourned in the land of the 
philistines seven years  3and it came 
to pass at the seven years end that the 
woman returned out of the land of the 
philistines  and she went forth to cry 
unto the king for her house and for her 
land 4now the king was talking with 
gehazi the servant of the man of god  
saying  tell me  i pray thee  all the 
great things that elisha hath done  
5and it came to pass  as he was telling 
the king how he had restored to life 
him that was dead  that behol d the 
woman  whose son he had restored to 
life cried to the king for her house and 
for her land  and gehazi said  my 
lord o king  this is the woman  and 
this is her son  whom elisha restored 
to life  6and when the king asked the 
woman  she told him  so the king 
appointed unto her a certain officer  
saying  restore all that was hers  and 
all the fruits of the field since the day 
that she left the land  even until now   
7and elisha came to damascus  and 
benhadad the king of aram was sick  
and it was t old him  saying  the man 
of god is come hither  8and the king 
said unto hazael  take a present in 
thy hand  and go meet the man of god  
and inquire of the lord by him  
saying  shall i recover of this 
sickness  9so hazael went to meet 
him and took a pr esent with him  even 
of every good thing of damascus  forty camels burden  and came and 
stood before him  and said  thy son 
benhadad king of aram hath sent me 
to thee  saying  shall i recover of this 
sickness  10and elisha said unto him  
go say unto h im thou shalt surely 
recover  howbeit the lord hath shown 
me that he shall surely die  11and he 
settled his countenance stedfastly upon 
him until he was ashamed  and the 
man of god wept  12and hazael said  
why weepeth my lord  and he 
answered  becaus e i know the evil 
that thou wilt do unto the children of 
israel  their strongholds wilt thou set 
on fire  and their young men wilt thou 
slay with the sword  and wilt dash in 
pieces their little ones  and rip up their 
women with child  13and hazael said  
but what is thy servant  who is but a 
dog that he should do this great 
thing  and elisha answered  the 
lord hath shown me that thou shalt be 
king over aram  14then he departed 
from elisha  and came to his master  
who said to him  what said elisha to 
thee and he answered  he told me 
that thou wouldest surely recover  
15and it came to pass on the morrow  
that he took the coverlet  and dipped it 
in water  and spread it on his face  so 
that he died  and hazael reigned in his 
stead   
16and in the fifth year of joram the 
son of ahab king of israel  
jehoshaphat being the king of judah  
jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king 
of judah began to reign  17thirty and 
two years old was he when he began to second kings  
531 
 reign  and he reigned eight years in 
jerusalem  18and he walk ed in the way 
of the kings of israel  as did the house 
of ahab  for he had the daughter of 
ahab to wife  and he did that which 
was evil in the sight of the lord 
19howbeit the lord would not destroy 
judah  for david his servant s sake  as 
he promised him t o give unto him a 
lamp and to his children alway   
20in his days edom revolted from 
under the hand of judah  and made a 
king over themselves  21then joram 
passed over to zair  and all his chariots 
with him  and he rose up by night  and 
smote the edomites t hat compassed 
him about  and the captains of the 
chariots  and the people fled to their 
tents  22yet edom revolted from under 
the hand of judah  unto this day  then 
did libnah revolt at the same time  
23and the rest of the acts of joram  and 
all that he di d are they not written in 
the book of the chronicles of the kings 
of judah  24and joram slept with his 
fathers  and was buried with his fathers 
in the city of david  and ahaziah his 
son reigned in his stead   
25in the twelfth year of joram the 
son of ahab  king of israel did ahaziah 
the son of jehoram king of judah 
begin to reign  26two and twenty years 
old was ahaziah when he began to 
reign  and he reigned one year in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
athaliah the daughter of omri king of 
israel  27and he walked in the way of 
the house of ahab  and did that which 
was evil in the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab  for he was the son 
inlaw of the house of ahab  28and he 
went with joram the son of ahab to 
war against hazael king of aram at 
ramoth gilead  and the arameans 
wounded joram  29and king joram 
returned to be healed in jezreel of the 
wounds which the arameans had 
given him at ramah  when he fought 
against hazael king of aram  and 
ahaziah the son of jehoram king of 
judah went down to see jo ram the son 
of ahab in jezreel  because he was 
sick  
 
and elisha the prophet called one 
of the sons of the prophets  and 
said unto him  gird up thy loins  and 
take this vial of oil in thy hand  and go 
to ramoth gilead  2and when thou 
comest thither  look out there jehu the 
son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi  
and go in  and make him arise up from 
among his brethren  and carry him to 
an inner chamber  3then take the vial 
of oil  and pour it on his head  and say  
thus saith the lord i have anointed 
thee king over israel  then open the 
door and flee  and tarry not  4so the 
young man  even the young man the 
prophet  went to ramoth gilead  5and 
when he came  behold  the captains of 
the host were sitting  and he said  i 
have an errand to thee  o captain  
and jehu said  unto which of us all  
and he said  to thee  o captain  
6and he arose  and went into the 
house  and he poured the oil on his 
head  and said unto him  thus saith 9 second kings  
532 
 the lord the god of israel  i have 
anointed thee king over the people of 
the lord even over israel  7and thou 
shalt smite the house of ahab thy 
master  that i may avenge the blood of 
my servants the prophets  and the 
blood of all the servants of the lord at 
the hand of jezebel  8for the whole 
house of ahab shall perish  and i will 
cut off from ahab every man child  
and him that is shut up and him that is 
left at large in israel  9and i will make 
the house of ahab like the house of 
jeroboam the son of nebat  and like 
the house of baasa the son of ahijah  
10and the dogs shall eat  jezebel in the 
portion of jezreel  and there shall be 
none to bury her  and he opened the 
door and fled   
11then jehu came forth to the 
servants of his lord  and one said unto 
him is all well  wherefore came this 
mad fellow to thee  and he said unto 
them  ye know the man and what his 
talk was  12and they said  it is false  
tell us now  and he said  thus and 
thus spoke he to me  saying  thus 
saith the lord i have anointed thee 
king over israel  13then they 
hastened  and took every man his 
garmen t and put it under him on the 
top of the stairs  and blew the horn  
saying  jehu is king   
14so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the 
son of nimshi conspired against 
joram now joram had been 
guarding ramoth gilead  he and all 
israel  because of hazael king o f aram  15but king ajoram was returned 
to be healed in jezreel of the wounds 
which the arameans had given him  
when he fought with hazael king of 
aram and jehu said  if this be your 
mind  then let none escape and go 
forth out of the city  to go to tell i t in 
jezreel  16so jehu rode in a chariot  
and went to jezreel  for joram lay 
there  and ahaziah king of judah was 
come down to see joram   
17now the watchman stood on the 
tower in jezreel  and he spied the 
company of jehu as he came  and said  
i see a c ompany  and joram said  
take a horseman  and send to meet 
them  and let him say  is it peace  
18so there went one on horseback to 
meet him  and said  thus saith the 
king is it peace  and jehu said  
what hast thou to do with peace  turn 
thee behind m e and the watchman 
told saying  the messenger came to 
them  but he cometh not back  19then 
he sent out a second on horseback  
who came to them  and said  thus 
saith the king  is it peace  and jehu 
answered  what hast thou to do with 
peace  turn the e behind me  20and the 
watchman told  saying  he came even 
unto them  and cometh not back  and 
the driving is like the driving of jehu 
the son of nimshi  for he driveth 
furiously   
21and joram said  make ready  
and they made ready his chariot  and 
                                                      
a heb jehoram  and in verses 17 21 
22 23 24  second kings  
533 
 joram king of israel and ahaziah king 
of judah went out  each in his chariot  
and they went out to meet jehu  and 
found him in the portion of naboth the 
jezreelite  22and it came to pass  when 
joram saw jehu  that he said  is it 
peace  jehu and he answered  what 
peace  so long as the harlotries of thy 
mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are 
so many  23and joram turned his 
hands  and fled  and said to ahaziah  
there is treachery  o ahaziah  24and 
jehu drew his bow with his full 
strength  and smote joram b etween his 
arms  and the arrow went out at his 
heart  and he sunk down in his chariot  
25then said jehu to bidkar his 
captain  take up  and cast him in the 
portion of the field of naboth the 
jezreelite  for remember how that  
when i and thou rode togeth er after 
ahab his father  the lord pronounced 
this burden against him  26surely i 
have seen yesterday the blood of 
naboth  and the blood of his sons  
saith the lord and i will requite thee 
in this plot  saith the lord now 
therefore take and cast him into  the 
plot of ground  according to the word 
of the lord  
27but when ahaziah the king of 
judah saw this  he fled by the way of 
the garden house  and jehu followed 
after him  and said  smite him also in 
the chariot  and they smote him  at 
the ascent of g ur which is by ibleam  
and he fled to megiddo  and died 
there  28and his servants carried him in 
a chariot to jerusalem  and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the 
city of david   
29and in the eleventh year of joram 
the son of ahab began ahaz iah to 
reign over judah   
30and when jehu was come to 
jezreel  jezebel heard of it  and she 
painted her eyes  and attired her head  
and looked out at the window  31and 
as jehu entered in at the gate  she said  
is it peace  thou zimri  thy master s 
murdere r 32and he lifted up his face 
to the window  and said  who is on 
my side  who and there looked out 
to him two or three officers  33and he 
said throw her down  so they threw 
her down  and some of her blood was 
sprinkled on the wall  and on the 
horse s and she was trodden under 
foot 34and when he was come in  he 
did eat and drink  and he said  look 
now after this cursed woman  and bury 
her for she is a king s daughter  
35and they went to bury her  but they 
found no more of her than the skull  
and the feet  and the palms of her 
hands  36wherefore they came back  
and told him  and he said  this is the 
word of the lord which he spoke by 
his servant elijah the tishbite  saying  
in the portion of jezreel shall the dogs 
eat the flesh of jezebel  37and the 
carcass of jezebel shall be as dung 
upon the face of the field in the portion 
of jezreel  so that they shall not say  
this is jezebel   
now ahab had seventy sons in 
samaria  and jehu wrote 
letters  and sent to samaria  unto the 10 second kings  
534 
 rulers of jezreel  even the elders  and 
unto them that brought up the sons 
ofahab  saying  2and now as soon as 
this letter cometh to you  seeing your 
master s sons are with you  and there 
are with you chariots and horses  
fortified cities also  and armour  3look 
ye out the  best and meetest of your 
master s sons  and set him on his 
father s throne  and fight for your 
master s house  4but they were 
exceedingly afraid  and said  behold  
the two kings stood not before him  
how then shall we stand  5and he that 
was over the h ousehold  and he that 
was over the city  the elders also  and 
they that brought up the children  sent 
to jehu  saying  we are thy servants  
and will do all that thou shalt bid us  
we will not make any man king  do 
thou that which is good in thine eyes  
6then he wrote a letter the second time 
to them  saying  if ye be on my side  
and if ye will hearken unto my voice  
take ye the heads of the men your 
master s sons  and come to me to 
jezreel by to morrow this time  now 
the king s sons  being seventy perso ns 
were with the great men of the city  
who brought them up  7and it came to 
pass when the letter came to them  
that they took the king s sons  and 
slew them  even seventy persons  and 
put their heads in baskets  and sent 
them unto him to jezreel  8and t here 
came a messenger  and told him  
saying  they have brought the heads 
of the king s sons  and he said  lay 
ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning  9and it 
came to pass in the morning  that he 
went out  and stood  and said  to all the 
people  ye are righteous  behold  i 
conspired against my master  and slew 
him but who smote all these  10know 
now that there shall fall unto the earth 
nothing of the word of the lord which 
the lord spoke concerning the house 
of ahab  for the  lord hath done that 
which he spoke by his servant elijah  
11so jehu smote all that remained of 
the house of ahab in jezreel  and all 
his great men  and his familiar friends  
and his priests  until there was left him 
none remaining   
12and he arose and de parted  and 
went to samaria  and as he was at the 
shearing house of the shepherds in the 
way 13jehu met with the brethren of 
ahaziah king of judah  and said  who 
are ye  and they answered  we are 
the brethren of ahaziah  and we go 
down to salute the ch ildren of the king 
and the children of the queen  14and 
he said  take them alive  and they 
took them alive  and slew them at the 
pit of the shearing house  even two 
and forty men  neither left he any of 
them   
15and when he was departed thence  
he light ed on jehonadab the son of 
rechab coming to meet him  and he 
saluted him  and said to him  is thy 
heart right  as my heart is with thy 
heart  and jehonadab answered  it 
is if it be  said jehu  give me thy 
hand  and he gave him his hand  and 
he too k him up to him into the chariot  second kings  
535 
 16and he said  come with me  and see 
my zeal for the lord so they made 
him ride in his chariot  17and when he 
came to samaria  he smote all that 
remained unto ahab in samaria  till he 
had destroyed him  according to the  
word of the lord which he spoke to 
elijah   
18and jehu gathered all the people 
together  and said unto them  ahab 
served baal a little  but jehu will serve 
him much  19now therefore call unto 
me all the prophets of baal  all his 
worshippers  and all his  priests  let 
none be wanting  for i have a great 
sacrifice to do to baal  whosoever 
shall be wanting  he shall not live  but 
jehu did it in subtlety  to the intent that 
he might destroy the worshippers of 
baal 20and jehu said  sanctify a 
solemn assembl y for baal  and they 
proclaimed it  21and jehu sent through 
all israel  and all the worshippers of 
baal came  so that there was not a man 
left that came not  and they came into 
the house of baal  and the house of 
baal was filled from one end to 
another  22and he said unto him that 
was over the vestry  bring forth 
vestments for all the worshippers of 
baal and he brought them forth 
vestments  23and jehu went  and 
jehonadab the son of rechab  into the 
house of baal  and he said unto the 
worshippers of baal  search  and look 
that there be here with you none of the 
servants of the lord but the 
worshippers of baal only  24and they 
went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings  now jehu had appointed 
him fourscore men without  and said  
if any of the men whom i bring into 
your hands escape  his life shall be for 
the life of him   
25and it came to pass  as soon as he 
had made an end of offering the burnt 
offering  that jehu said to the guard 
and to the captains  go in  and slay 
them  let none come forth  and they 
smote them with the edge of the 
sword  and the guard and the captains 
cast them out  and went to the city of 
the house of baal  26and they brought 
forth the pillars that were in the house 
of baal  and burned them  27and they 
broke down the pillar  of baal  and 
broke down the house of baal  and 
made it a draught house  unto this day   
28thus jehu destroyed baal out of 
israel  29howbeit from the sins of 
jeroboam the son of nebat  wherewith 
he made israel to sin  jehu departed 
not from after them  the golden calves 
that were in beth el and that were in 
dan 30and the lord said unto jehu  
because thou hast done well in 
executing that which is right in mine 
eyes and hast done unto the house of 
ahab according to all that was in my 
heart  thy sons of th e fourth generation 
shall sit on the throne of israel  31but 
jehu took no heed to walk in the law 
of the lord the god of israel  with all 
his heart  he departed not from the sins 
of jeroboam  wherewith he made 
israel to sin   
32in those days the lord began to 
cut israel short  and hazael smote second kings  
536 
 them in all the borders of israel  33from 
the jordan eastward  all the land of 
gilead  the gadites  and the 
reubenites  and the manassites  from 
aroer  which is by the valley of 
arnon  even gilead and bashan  
34now the rest of the acts of jehu  and 
all that he did  and all his might  are 
they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of israel  35and 
jehu slept with his fathers  and they 
buried him in samaria  and jehoahaz 
his son reigned in his stead  36and the 
time that jehu reigned over israel in 
samaria was twenty and eight years   
now when athaliah the 
mother of ahaziah saw that 
her son was dead  she arose and 
destroyed all the seed royal  2but 
jehosheba  the daughter of king joram  
sister of ahaz iah took joash the son 
of ahaziah  and stole him away from 
among the king s sons that were slain  
even him and his nurse  and put them 
in the bed chamber  and they hid him 
from athaliah  so that he was not slain  
3and he was with her hid in the house 
of the lord six years  and athaliah 
reigned over the land   
4and in the seventh year jehoiada 
sent and fetched the captains over 
hundreds  of the carites and of the 
guard  and brought them to him into 
the house of the lord and he made a 
covenant with them  and took an oath 
of them in the house of the lord and 
showed them the king s son  5and he 
commanded them  saying  this is the 
thing that ye shall do  a third part of you that come in on the sabbath  and 
that keep the watch of the king s 
house  6now anothe r third part was at 
the gate sur  and another third part at 
the gate behind the guard shall keep 
the watch of the house  and be a 
barrier  7and the other two parts of 
you even all that go forth on the 
sabbath  shall keep the watch of the 
house of the lord about the king  8and 
ye shall compass the king round about  
every man with his weapons in his 
hand  and he that cometh within the 
ranks  let him be slain  and be ye with 
the king when he goeth out  and when 
he cometh in   
9and the captains over hundreds did 
according to all that jehoiada the priest 
commanded  and they took every man 
his men  those that were to come in on 
the sabbath  with those that were to go 
out on the sabbath  and came to 
jehoiada the priest  10and the priest 
delivered to the captains over hundreds 
the spear and shields that had been 
king david s which were in the house 
of the lord 11and the guard stood  
every man with his weapons in his 
hand  from the right side of the house 
to the left side of the house  along by 
the altar and the h ouse by the king 
round about  12then he brought out the 
kings son  and put upon him the 
crown and the insignia  and they made 
him king  and anointed him  and they 
clapped their hands  and said  long 
live the king   
13and when athaliah heard the 
noise o f the guard and of the people  11 second kings  
537 
 she came to the people into the house 
of the lord 14and she looked  and 
behold  the king stood on the platform  
as the manner was  and the captains 
and the trumpets by the king  and all 
the people of the land rejoiced  and 
blew with trumpets  then athaliah 
rent her clothes  and cried  treason  
treason  15and jehoiada the priest 
commanded the captains of hundreds  
the officers of the host  and said unto 
them  have her forth between the 
ranks  and him that followeth her sla y 
with the sword  for the priest said  
let her not be slain in the house of the 
lord 16so they made way for her  
and she went by the way of the 
horses entry to the king s house  and 
there was she slain   
17and jehoiada made a covenant 
between the lord and the king and the 
people  that they should be the l ords 
people  between the king also and the 
people  18and all the people of the land 
went to the house of baal  and broke it 
down  his altars and his images broke 
they in pieces thoroughly  and slew 
mattan the priest of baal before the 
altars  and the priest appointed 
officers over the house of the lord 
19and he took the captains over 
hundreds  and the carites  and the 
guard  and all the people of the land  
and they brought down the king from 
the house of the lord and came by the 
way of the gate of the guard unto the 
kings house  and he sat on the throne 
of the kings  20so all the people of the 
land rejoiced  and the city was quiet  and they slew athaliah with the sword 
at the king s house   
jehoash  was seven years old 
when he began to reign  2in the 
seventh year of jehu began jehoash to 
reign  and he reigned forty years in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
zibiah of beer sheba  3and jehoash 
did that which was right in the eyes of 
the lord all his  days wherein jehoiada 
the priest instructed him  4howbeit the 
high places were not taken away  the 
people still sacrificed and offered in 
the high places   
5and jehoash said to the priests  
all the money of the hallowed things 
that is brought into the ho use of the 
lord in current money  the money of 
the persons for whom each man is 
rated  all the money that cometh into 
any man s heart to bring into the house 
of the lord 6let the priests take it to 
them  every man from him that 
bestoweth it upon him  and they shall 
repair the breaches of the house  
wheresoever any breach shall be 
found  7but it was so  that in the three 
and twentieth year of king jehoash the 
priests had not repaired the breaches of 
the house  8then king jehoash called 
for jehoiada the pr iest and for the 
other priests  and said unto them  
why repair ye not the breaches of the 
house  now therefore take no longer 
money from them that bestow it upon 
you but deliver it for the breaches of 
the house  9and the priests consented 
that they sho uld take no longer money 12 second kings  
538 
 from the people  neither repair the 
breaches of the house   
10and jehoiada the priest took a 
chest  and bored a hole in the lid of it  
and set it beside the altar  on the right 
side as one cometh into the house of 
the lord and the  priests that kept the 
threshold put therein all the money 
that was brought into the house of the 
lord 11and it was so  when they saw 
that there was much money in the 
chest  that the king s scribe and the 
high priest came up  and they put up in 
bags and c ounted the money that was 
found in the house of the lord 12and 
they gave the money that was weighed 
out into the hands of them that did the 
work  that had the oversight of the 
house of the lord and they paid it out 
to the carpenters and the builders  that 
wrought upon the house of the lord 
13and to the masons and the hewers of 
stone  and for buying timber and hewn 
stone to repair the breaches of the 
house of the lord and for all that was 
laid out for the house to repair it  14but 
there were not made for  the house of 
the lord cups of silver  snuffers  
basins  trumpets  any vessels of gold  
or vessels of silver  of the money that 
was brought into the house of the 
lord 15for they gave that to them that 
did the work  and repaired therewith 
the house of the lord 16moreover they 
reckoned not with the men  into whose 
hand they delivered the money to give 
to them that did the work  for they 
dealt faithfully  17the forfeit money  
and the sin money  was not brought into the house of the lord it was the 
priests   
18then hazael king of aram went 
up and fought against gath  and took 
it and hazael set his face to go up to 
jerusalem  19and jehoash king judah 
took all the hallowed things that 
jehoshaphat  and jehoram  and 
ahaziah  his fathers  kings of judah  
had ded icated  and his own hallowed 
things  and all the gold that was found 
in the treasures of the house of the 
lord and of the king s house  and sent 
it to hazael king of aram  and he went 
away from jerusalem   
20now the rest of the acts of joash  
and all that  he did  are they not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of judah  21and his servants 
arose  and made a conspiracy  and 
smote joash at beth millo  on the way 
that goeth down to silla  22 for jozacar 
the son of shimeath  and jehozabad 
the so n of shomer  his servants  smote 
him and he died  and they buried him 
with his fathers in the city of david  
and amaziah his son reigned in his 
stead   
in the three and twentieth year 
of joash the son of ahaziah  
king of judah  jehoahaz the son of 
jehu began to reign over israel in 
samaria  and reigned seventeen years  
2and he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the lord and followed the 
sins of jeroboam the son of nebat  
wherewith he made israel to sin  he 
departed not therefrom  3and the anger 
of the lord was kindled against israel  13 second kings  
539 
 and he delivered them into the hand of 
hazael king of aram  and into the 
hand of ben hadad the son of hazael  
continually  4and jehoahaz besought 
the lord and the lord hearkened unto 
him for he saw the oppression of 
israel  how that the king of aram 
oppressed them  5and the lord gave 
israel a deliverer  so that they went out 
from under the hand of the arameans  
and the children of israel dwelt in their 
tents  as beforetime  6nevertheless 
they departed not from the si ns of the 
house of jeroboam  wherewith he 
made israel to sin  but walked therein  
and there remained the asherah also in 
samaria  7for there was not left to 
jehoahaz of the people save fifty 
horsemen  and ten chariots  and ten 
thousand footmen  for the ki ng of 
aram destroyed them  and made them 
like the dust in threshing  8now the 
rest of the acts of jehoahaz  and all 
that he did  and his might  are they not 
written in the book of the chronicles of 
the kings of israel  9and jehoahaz 
slept with his fathers  and they buried 
him in samaria  and joash his son 
reigned in his stead   
10in the thirty and seventh year of 
joash king of judah began jehoash the 
son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in 
samaria  and reigned sixteen years  
11and he did that which was evil  in the 
sight of the lord he departed not from 
all the sins of jeroboam the son of 
nebat  wherewith he made israel to 
sin but he walked therein  12now the 
rest of the acts of joash  and all that he did and his might wherewith he 
fought against amaziah k ing of judah  
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of israel  13and 
joash slept with his fathers  and 
jeroboam sat upon his throne  and 
joash was buried in samaria with the 
kings of israel   
14now elisha was fallen sick of his 
sickness whereof he was to die  and 
joash the king of israel came down 
unto him  and wept over him  and said  
my father  my father  the chariots of 
israel and the horsemen thereof   
15and elisha said unto him  take bow 
and arrows  and he took unto him 
bow and arrows  16and he said to the 
king of israel  put thy hand upon the 
bow and he put his hand upon it  and 
elisha laid his hands upon the king s 
hands  17and he said  open the 
window eastward  and he opened it  
then elisha said  shoot and he sho t 
and he said  the l ords arrow of 
victory  even the arrow of victory 
against aram  for thou shalt smite the 
arameans in aphek  till thou have 
consumed them  18and he said  take 
the arrows  and he took them  and he 
said unto the king of israel  smite 
upon the ground  and he smote thrice  
and stayed  19and the man of god was 
wroth with him  and said  thou 
shouldest have smitten five or six 
times  then hadst thou smitten aram 
till thou hadst consumed it  whereas 
now thou shalt smite aram but thrice   
20and elisha died  and they buried 
him now the bands of the moabites second kings  
540 
 used to invade the land at the coming 
in of the year  21and it came to pass  as 
they were burying a man  that behold  
they spied a band  and they cast the 
man into the sepulchre of eli sha and 
as soon as the man touched the bones 
of elisha  he revived  and stood up on 
his feet   
22and hazael king of aram 
oppressed israel all the days of 
jehoahaz  23but the lord was gracious 
unto them  and had compassion on 
them  and had respect unto the m 
because of his covenant with 
abraham  isaac  and jacob  and would 
not destroy them  neither hath he cast 
them from his presence until now  
24and hazael king of aram died  and 
benhadad his son reigned in his stead  
25and jehoash the son of jehoahaz 
took again out of the hand of ben 
hadad the son of hazael the cities 
which he had taken out of the hand of 
jehoahaz his father by war  three 
times did joash smite him  and 
recovered the cities of israel   
in the second year of joash 
son of joahaz king of is rael 
began amaziah the son of joash king 
of judah to reign  2he was twenty and 
five years old when he began to reign  
and he reigned twenty and nine years 
in jerusalem  and his mother s name 
was jehoaddan of jerusalem  3and he 
did that which was right in t he eyes of 
the lord yet not like david his father  
he did according to all that joash his 
father had done  4howbeit the high 
places were not taken away  the people still sacrificed and offered in the high 
places  5and it came to pass  as soon 
as the kingd om was established in his 
hand  that he slew his servants who 
had slain the king his father  6but the 
children of the murderers he put not to 
death  according to that which is 
written in the book of the law of 
moses  as the lord commanded 
saying  the fath ers shall not be put to 
death for the children  nor the children 
be put to death for the fathers  but 
every man shall be put to death for his 
own sin  7he slew of edom in the 
valley of salt ten thousand  and took 
sela by war  and called the name of it 
joktheel  unto this day   
8then amaziah sent messengers to 
jehoash  the son of jehoahaz son of 
jehu king of israel  saying  come  let 
us look one another in the face  9and 
jehoash the king of israel sent to 
amaziah king of judah  saying  the 
thistle that was in lebanon sent to the 
cedar that was in lebanon  saying  
give thy daughter to my son to wife  
and there passed by the wild beasts 
that were in lebanon  and trod down 
the thistle  10thou hast indeed smitten 
edom  and will thy heart lift thee up  
glory therein  and remain at home  for 
why shouldest thou meddle with evil  
that thou shouldest fall  even thou  and 
judah with thee  11but amaziah would 
not hear  so jehoash king of israel 
went up  and he and amaziah king of 
judah looked one another in the face  at 
beth shemesh  which belongeth to 
judah  12and judah was put to the 14 second kings  
541 
 worse before israel  and they fled 
every man to his tent  13and jehoash 
king of israel took amaziah king of 
judah  the son of jehoash the son of 
ahaziah  at beth shemesh  and came 
to je rusalem  and broke down the wall 
of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim 
unto the corner gate  four hundred 
cubits  14and he took all the gold and 
silver  and all the vessels that were 
found in the house of the lord and in 
the treasures of the king s house  the 
hostages also  and returned to samaria   
15now the rest of the acts of jehoash 
which he did  and his might  and how 
he fought with amaziah king of judah  
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of israel  16and 
jehoash slept wi th his fathers  and was 
buried in samaria with the kings of 
israel  and jeroboam his son reigned in 
his stead   
17and amaziah the son of joash 
king of judah lived after the death of 
jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel 
fifteen years  18now the rest of th e acts 
of amaziah  are they not written in the 
book of the chronicles of the kings of 
judah  19and they made a conspiracy 
against him in jerusalem  and he fled 
to lachish  but they sent after him to 
lachish  and slew him there  20and 
they brought him upon horses  and he 
was buried at jerusalem with his 
fathers in the city of david  21and all 
the people of judah took azariah  who 
was sixteen years old  and made him 
king in the room of his father 
amaziah  22he built elath  and restored it to judah  after that  the king 
slept with his fathers   
23in the fifteenth year of amaziah 
the son of joash king of judah

his son to pass through the fire  
according to the abominations of the 
heathen  whom  the lord cast out from 
before the children of israel  4and he 
sacrificed and offered in the high 
places  and on the hills  and under

5then rezin king of aram and

came up to jerusalem to war  and they  
besieged ahaz  but could not 
overcome him  6at that time rezin 
king of aram recovered elath to 
aram  and drove the jews from aelath  
and the edomites came to elath  and 
dwelt there  unto this day   
7so ahaz sent messengers to 
tiglath pileser king of assyr ia saying  
i am thy servant and thy son  come 
up and save me out of the hand of the 
king of aram  and out of the hand of 
the king of israel  who rise up against 
me 8and ahaz took the silver and 
gold that was found in the house of the 
lord and in the treasures of the king s 
                                                      
a heb eloth  house  and sent it for a present to the 
king of assyria  9and the king of 
assyria hearkened unto him  and the 
king of assyria went up against 
damascus  and took it  and carried the 
people of it captive to kir  and slew 
rezin   
10and king ahaz went to damascus 
to meet tiglath pileser king of

urijah the priest the fashion of the 
altar and the pattern of it  according to 
all the workmanship thereof  11and 
urijah the  priest built an altar  
according to all that king ahaz had 
sent from damascus  so did urijah the 
priest make it against the coming of 
king ahaz from damascus  12and 
when the king was come from 
damascus  the king saw the altar  and 
the king drew near unto the altar  and 
offered thereon  13and he offered his 
burnt offering and his meal offering  
and poured his drink offering  and 
dashed the blood of his peace 
offerings against the altar  14and the 
brazen altar  which was before the 
lord he brought from the forefront of 
the house  from between his altar and 
the house of the lord and put it on the

morning burnt offering  and the 
evening meal offering  and the king s 
burnt offering  and his meal offering  
with the burnt offering of all the 
people of the land  and their meal 16 second kings  
545 
 offering  and their drink offerings  and 
dash against it all the blood of the 
burnt offering  and all the blood of the 
sacrifice  but the brazen altar shall be 
for me to look to  16thus did urijah 
the priest  according to all that king 
ahaz commanded   
17and king ahaz cut off the borders 
of the bases  and removed the laver 
from off them  and took down the sea 
from off the brazen oxen  that were 
under it  and put it upon a pavement of 
stone  18and the covered place for the 
sabbath that they had built in the 
house  and the king s entry without  
turned he unto the house of the lord 
because of the king of assyria  19now 
the rest of the ac ts of ahaz which he 
did are they not written in the book of 
the chronicles of the kings of judah  
20and ahaz slept with his fathers  and 
was buried with his fathers in the city 
of david  and hezekiah his son 
reigned in his stead   
in the twelfth year o f ahaz 
king of judah began hoshea 
the son of elah to reign in samaria 
over israel  and reigned nine years  
2and he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the lord yet not as the kings 
of israel that were before him  
3against him came up shalmaneser 
king of assyria  and hoshea became 
his servant  and brought him presents  
4and the king of assyria found 
conspiracy in hoshea  for he had sent 
messengers to so king of egypt  and 
offered no present to the king of 
assyria  as he had done year by year  therefore the king of assyria shut him 
up and bound him in prison  5then the 
king of assyria came up throughout all 
the land  and went up to samaria  and 
besieged it three years  6in the ninth 
year of hoshea  the king of assyria 
took samaria  and carried israel awa y 
unto assyria  and placed them in 
halah  and in habor  on the river of 
gozan  and in the cities of the medes   
7and it was so  because the children 
of israel had sinned against the lord 
their god  who brought them up out of 
the land of egypt from under th e hand 
of pharaoh king of egypt  and had 
feared other gods  8and walked in the 
statutes of the nations  whom the lord 
cast out from before the children of 
israel  and of the kings of israel  which 
they practised  9and the children of 
israel did impute thin gs that were not 
right unto the lord their god  and they 
built them high places in all their 
cities  from the tower of the watchmen 
to the fortified city  10and they set 
them up pillars and asherim upon 
every high hill  and under every leafy 
tree 11and th ere they offered in all the 
high places  as did the nations whom 
the lord carried away before them  
and wrought wicked things to provoke 
the lord 12and they served idols  
whereof the lord had said unto them  
ye shall not do this thing  13yet the 
lord forewarned israel  and judah  by 
the hand of every prophet  and of 
every seer  saying  turn ye from your 
evil ways  and keep my 
commandments and my statutes  17 second kings  
546 
 according to all the law which i 
commanded your fathers  and which i 
sent to you by the hand of my servants 
the prophets  14notwithstanding they 
would not hear  but hardened their 
neck  like to the neck of their fathers  
who believed not in the lord their 
god 15and they rejected his statutes  
and his covenant that he made with 
their fathers  and his t estimonies 
wherewith he testified against them  
and they went after things of nought  
and became nought  and after the 
nations that were round about them  
concerning whom the lord had 
charged them that they should not do 
like them  16and they forsook all t he 
commandments of the lord their god  
and made them molten images  even 
two calves  and made an asherah  and 
worshipped all the host of heaven  and 
served baal  17and they caused their 
sons and their daughters to pass 
through the fire  and used divination  
and enchantments  and gave 
themselves over to do that which was 
evil in the sight of the lord to 
provoke him  18that the lord was very 
angry with israel  and removed them 
out of his sight  there was none left 
but the tribe of judah only  19also 
judah kep t not the commandments of 
the lord their god  but walked in the 
statutes of israel which they practised  
20and the lord rejected all the seed of 
israel  and afflicted them  and 
delivered them into the hand of 
spoilers  until he had cast them out of 
his sig ht 21for he rent israel from the house of david  and they made 
jeroboam the son of nebat king  and 
jeroboam drew israel away from 
following the lord and made them sin 
a great sin  22and the children of israel 
walked in all the sins of jeroboam 
which he d id they departed not from 
them  23until the lord removed israel 
out of his sight  as he spoke by the 
hand of all his servants the prophets  
so israel was carried away out of their 
own land to assyria  unto this day   
24and the king of assyria brought 
men from babylon  and from cuthah  
and from avva  and from hamath and 
sepharvaim  and placed them in the 
cities of samaria instead of the 
children of israel  and they possessed 
samaria  and dwelt in the cities 
thereof  25and so it was  at the 
beginning of thei r dwelling there  that 
they feared not the lord therefore the 
lord sent lions among them  which 
killed some of them  26wherefore they 
spoke to the king of assyria  saying  
the nations which thou hast carried 
away  and placed in the cities of 
samaria  know not the manner of the 
god of the land  therefore he hath sent 
lions among them  and behold  they 
slay them  because they know not the 
manner of the god of the land   
27then the king of assyria 
commanded  saying  carry thither one 
of the priests whom y e brought from 
thence  and let them go and dwell 
there  and let him teach them the 
manner of the god of the land  28so 
one of the priests whom they had second kings  
547 
 carried away from samaria came and 
dwelt in beth el and taught them how 
they should fear the lord 29howbeit 
every nation made gods of their own  
and put them in the houses of the high 
places which the samaritans had 
made  every nation in their cities 
wherein they dwelt  30and the men of 
babylon made succoth benoth  and 
the men of cuth made nergal  and the  
men of hamath made ashima  31and 
the avvites made nibhaz and tartak  
and the sepharvites burnt their 
children in the fire to adrammelech 
and anammelech  the gods of 
sepharvaim  32so they feared the lord 
and made unto them from among 
themselves priests of  the high places  
who sacrificed for them in the houses 
of the high places  33they feared the 
lord and served their own gods  after 
the manner of the nations from among 
whom they had been carried away   
34unto this day they do after the 
former manners  they fear not the 
lord neither do they after their 
statutes  or after their ordinances  or 
after the law or after the 
commandment which the lord 
commanded the children of jacob  
whom he named israel  35with whom 
the lord had made a covenant  and 
charged the m saying  ye shall not 
fear other gods  nor bow down to 
them  nor serve them  nor sacrifice to 
them  36but the lord who brought you 
up out of the land of egypt with great 
power and with an outstretched arm  
him shall ye fear  and him shall ye worship  and to him shall ye sacrifice  
37and the statutes and the ordinances  
and the law and the commandment  
which he wrote for you  ye shall 
observe to do for evermore  and ye 
shall not fear other gods  38and the 
covenant that i have made with you ye 
shall not f orget  neither shall ye fear 
other gods  39but the lord your god 
shall ye fear  and he will deliver you 
out of the hand of all your enemies  
40howbeit they did not hearken  but 
they did after their former manner  
41so these nations feared the lord and 
served their graven images  their 
children likewise  and their children s 
children  as did their fathers  so do 
they unto this day   
now it came to pass in the 
third year of hoshea son of 
elah king of israel  that hezekiah the 
son of ahaz king of judah be gan to 
reign  2twenty and five years old was 
he when he began to reign  and he 
reigned twenty and nine years in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
abi the daughter of zechariah  3and 
he did that which was right in the eyes 
of the lord according to all t hat 
david his father had done  4he 
removed the high places  and broke the 
pillars  and cut down the asherah  and 
he broke in pieces the brazen serpent 
that moses had made  for unto those 
days the children of israel did offer to 
it and it was called anehus htan 5he 
trusted in the lord the god of israel  
                                                      
a that is a thing of brass  18 second kings  
548 
 so that after him was none like him 
among all the kings of judah  nor 
among them that were before him  
6for he cleaved to the lord he 
departed not from following him  but 
kept his commandments  which the 
lord commanded moses  7and the 
lord was with him  whithersoever he 
went forth he prospered  and he 
rebelled against the king of assyria  
and served him not  8he smote the 
philistines unto gaza and the borders 
thereof  from the tower of the 
watchmen to the f ortified city  9and it 
came to pass in the fourth year of king 
hezekiah  which was the seventh year 
of hoshea son of elah king of israel  
that shalmaneser king of assyria came 
up against samaria  and besieged it  
10and at the end of three years they 
took i t even in the sixth year of 
hezekiah  which was the ninth year of 
hoshea king of israel  samaria was 
taken  11and the king of assyria 
carried israel away unto assyria  and 
put them in halah  and in habor  on 
the river of gozan  and in the cities of 
the me des 12because they hearkened 
not to the voice of the lord their god  
but transgressed his covenant  even all 
that moses the servant of the lord 
commanded  and would not hear it  
nor do it   
13now in the fourteenth year of king 
hezekiah did sennacherib kin g of 
assyria come up against all the 
fortified cities of judah  and took 
them  14and hezekiah king of judah 
sent to the king of assyria to lachish  saying  i have offended  return from 
me that which thou puttest on me will 
i bear  and the king of assyri a 
appointed unto hezekiah king of judah 
three hundred talents of silver and 
thirty talents of gold  15and hezekiah 
gave him all the silver that was found 
in the house of the lord and in the 
treasures of the king s house  16at that 
time did hezekiah cut of f the gold 
from the doors of the temple of the 
lord and from the door posts which 
hezekiah king of judah had overlaid  
and gave it to the king of assyria   
17and the king of assyria sent 
atartan and brabsaris and crab
shakeh from lachish to king hezekiah  
with a great army unto jerusalem  and 
they went up and came to jerusalem  
and when they were come up  they 
came and stood by the conduit of the 
upper pool  which is in the highway of 
the fullers field 18and when they had 
called to the king  there came ou t to 
them eliakim the son of hilkiah  who 
was over the household  and shebnah 
the scribe  and joah the son of asaph 
the recorder   
19and rab shakeh said unto them  
say ye now to hezekiah  thus saith 
the great king  the king of assyria  
what confidence is this wherein thou 
trustest  20sayest thou that a mere 
word of the lips is counsel and strength 
for the war  now on whom dost thou 
                                                      
a that is commander inchief  
b that is chief of the eunuchs  
c that is chief butler  second kings  
549 
 trust that thou hast rebelled against 
me 21now  behold  thou trustest upon 
the staff of this bruised reed  even 
upon egypt  whereon if a man lean  it 
will go into his hand  and pierce it  so 
is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that 
trust on him  22but if ye say unto me  
we trust in the lord our god  is not 
that he  whose high places and whose 
altars hezekiah hath taken away  and 
hath said to judah and to jerusalem  
ye shall worship before this altar in 
jerusalem  23now therefore  i pray 
thee make a wager with my master the 
king of assyria  and i will give thee 
two thousand horses  if thou be able on 
thy part to set riders upon th em 24how 
then canst thou turn away the face of 
one captain  even of the least of my 
masters servants  and yet thou puttest 
thy trust on egypt for chariots and for 
horsemen  25am i now come up 
without the lord against this place to 
destroy it  the lord said unto me  go 
up against this land  destroy it   
26then said eliakim the son of 
hilkiah  and shebnah  and joah  unto 
rabshakeh  speak  i pray thee  to thy 
servants in the aramean language  for 
we understand it  and speak not with 
us in the jews language  in the ears of 
the people that are on the wall  27but 
rabshakeh said unto them  hath my 
master sent me to thy master  and to 
thee to speak these words  hath he not 
sent me to the men that sit on the wall  
to eat their own dung  and to drink 
their own  water with you  28then 
rabshakeh stood  and cried with a loud voice in the jews language  and 
spoke  saying  hear ye the word of 
the great king  the king of assyria  
29thus saith the king  let not hezekiah 
beguile you  for he will not be able to 
delive r you out of his hand  30neither 
let hezekiah make you trust in the 
lord saying  the lord will surely 
deliver us  and this city shall not be 
given into the hand of the king of 
assyria  31hearken not to hezekiah  
for thus saith the king of assyria  
make yo ur peace with me  and come 
out to me  and eat ye every one of his 
vine and every one of his fig tree and 
drink ye every one the waters of his 
own cistern  32until i come and take 
you away to a land like your own land  
a land of corn and wine  a land of 
bread and vineyards  a land of olive 
trees and of honey  that ye may live  
and not die  and hearken not unto 
hezekiah  when he persuadeth you  
saying  the lord will deliver us  
33hath any of the gods of the nations 
ever delivered his land out of the hand 
of the king of assyria  34where are the 
gods of hamath  and of arpad  where 
are the gods of sepharvaim  of hena  
and ivvah  have they delivered 
samaria out of my hand  35who are 
they among all the gods of the 
countries  that have delivered their 
country out of my hand  that the lord 
should deliver jerusalem out of my 
hand   
36but the people held their peace  
and answered him not a word  for the 
kings commandment was  saying  second kings  
550 
 answer him not  37then came 
eliakim the son of hilkiah  who was 
over the househol d and shebna the 
scribe  and joah the son of asaph the 
recorder  to hezekiah with their 
clothes rent  and told him the words of 
rabshakeh   
and it came to pass  when 
king hezekiah heard it  that he 
rent his clothes  and covered himself 
with sackcloth  and went into the 
house of the lord 2and he sent 
eliakim  who was over the household  
and shebna the scribe  and the elders 
of the priests  covered with sackcloth  
unto isaiah the prophet the son of 
amoz  3and they said unto him  thus 
saith hezekiah  this day is a day of 
trouble  and of rebuke  and of 
contumely  for the children are come 
to the birth  and there is not strength to 
bring forth  4it may be the lord thy 
god will hear all the words of rab 
shakeh  whom the king of assyria his 
master hath sent to taunt the living 
god and will rebuke the words which 
the lord thy god hath heard  
wherefore make prayer for the remnant 
that is left  5so the servants of king 
hezekiah came to isaiah  6and isaiah 
said unto them  thus shall ye say to 
your master  thus  saith the lord be 
not afraid of the words that thou hast 
heard  wherewith the servants of the 
king of assyria have blasphemed me  
7behold  i will put a spirit in him  and 
he shall hear a rumour  and shall return 
to his own land  and i will cause him 
to fall by the sword in his own land   8so rab shakeh returned  and found 
the king of assyria warring against 
libnah  for he had heard that he was 
departed from lachish  9and when he 
heard say of tirhakah king of 
ethiopia  behold  he is come out to 
fight aga inst thee  he sent messengers 
again unto hezekiah  saying  10thus 
shall ye speak to hezekiah king of 
judah  saying  let not thy god in 
whom thou trustest beguile thee  
saying  jerusalem shall not be given 
into the hand of the king of assyria  
11behold  thou hast heard what the 
kings of assyria have done to all 
lands  by destroying them utterly  and 
shalt thou be delivered  12have the 
gods of the nations delivered them  
which my fathers have destroyed  
gozan  and haran  and rezeph  and 
the children of eden  that were in 
telassar  13where is the king of 
hamath  and the king of arpad  and 
the king of the city of sepharvaim  of 
hena  and ivvah   
14and hezekiah received the letter 
from the hand of the messengers  and 
read it  and hezekiah went up unto the 
house  of the lord and spread it before 
the lord 15and hezekiah prayed 
before the lord and said  o lord the 
god of israel  that sittest upon the 
cherubim  thou art the god  even 
thou alone  of all the kingdoms of the 
earth  thou hast made heaven and 
earth  16incline thine ear  o lord and 
hear open thine eyes  o lord and 
see and hear the words of 
sennacherib  wherewith he hath sent 19 second kings  
551 
 him to taunt the living god  17of a 
truth  lord the kings of assyria have 
laid waste the nations and their lands  
18and have  cast their gods into the fire  
for they were no gods  but the work of 
mens hands  wood and stone  
therefore they have destroyed them  
19now therefore  o lord our god  
save thou us  i beseech thee  out of 
his hand  that all the kingdoms of the 
earth may k now that thou art the lord 
god even thou only   
20then isaiah the son of amoz sent 
to hezekiah  saying  thus saith the 
lord the god of israel  whereas thou 
hast prayed to me against sennacherib 
king of assyria  i have heard thee  
21this is the word tha t the lord hath 
spoken concerning him   
the virgin daughter of zion  
hath despised thee and laughed thee 
to scorn   
the daughter of jerusalem  
hath shaken her head at thee   
22whom hast thou taunted and  
blasphemed   
and against whom hast thou exalted 
thy voice   
yea thou hast lifted up thine eyes 
on high   
even against the holy one of israel   
23by the messengers thou hast 
taunted the lord   
and hast said  with the multitude of 
my chariots  
am i come up to the height of the 
mountains   
to the innermost pa rts of lebanon   
and i have cut down the tall cedars   thereof   
and the choice cypresses thereof  
and i have entered into his 
farthest lodge   
the forest of his fruitful field   
24i have digged and drunk  
strange waters   
and with the sole of my feet have  i 
dried up  
all the rivers of egypt   
 
25hast thou not heard   
long ago i made it   
in ancient times i fashioned it   
now have i brought it to pass   
yea it is done  that fortified cities  
should be laid waste into ruinous 
heaps   
26therefore their inhab itants were of 
small power   
they were dismayed and 
confounded   
they were as the grass of the field   
and as the green herb   
as the grass on the housetops   
and as corn blasted before it is 
grown up   
 
27but i know thy sitting down  and 
thy going out  and thy coming in   
and thy raging against me   
28because of thy raging against me   
and for that thy tumult is come up 
into  
mine ears   
therefore will i put my hook in thy 
nose  
and my bridle in thy lips   
and i will turn thee back by the way  second kings  
552 
 by which th ou camest   
29and this shall be the sign unto 
thee ye shall eat this year that which 
groweth of itself  and in the second 
year that which springeth of the same  
and in the third year sow ye  and reap  
and plant vineyards  and eat the fruit 
thereof  30and the remnant that is 
escaped of the house of judah shall 
again take root downward  and bear 
fruit upward  31for out of jerusalem 
shall go forth a remnant  and out of 
mount zion they that shall escape  the 
zeal of the lord of hosts shall perform 
this 32ther efore thus saith the lord 
concerning the king of assyria  he 
shall not come unto this city  nor shoot 
an arrow there  neither shall he come 
before it with shield  nor cast a mound 
against it  33by the way that he came  
by the same shall he return  and he 
shall not come unto this city  saith the 
lord 34for i will defend this city to 
save it  for mine own sake  and for my 
servant david s sake   
35and it came to pass that night  that 
the angel of the lord went forth  and 
smote in the camp of the assyrians a 
hundred fourscore and five thousand  
and when men arose early in the 
morning  behold  they were all dead 
corpses  36so sennacherib king of 
assyria departed  and went and 
returned  and dwelt at nineveh  37and 
it came to pass  as he was worshipping 
in the ho use of nisroch his god  that 
adrammelech and sarezer his sons 
smote him with the sword  and they 
escaped into the land of ararat  and esarhaddon his son reigned in his 
stead   
in those days was hezekiah 
sick unto death  and isaiah the 
prophet the son of  amoz came to him  
and said unto him  thus saith the 
lord set thy house in order  for thou 
shalt die  and not live  2then he 
turned his face to the wall  and prayed 
unto the lord saying  3remember 
now o lord i beseech thee  how i 
have walked before thee in truth and 
with a whole heart  and have done that 
which is good in thy sight  and 
hezekiah wept sore  4and it came to 
pass before isaiah was gone out of the 
inner court of the city  that the word of 
the lord came to him  saying  
5return  and say to hezekiah the 
prince of my people  thus saith the 
lord the god of david thy father  i 
have heard thy prayer  i have seen thy 
tears  behold  i will heal thee  on the 
third day thou shalt go up unto the 
house of the lord 6and i will add 
unto thy days fif teen years  and i will 
deliver thee and this city out of the 
hand of the king of assyria  and i will 
defend this city for mine own sake  
and for my servant david s sake  
7and isaiah said  take a cake of figs  
and they took and laid it on the boil  
and h e recovered   
8and hezekiah said unto isaiah  
what shall be the sign that the lord 
will heal me  and that i shall go up 
unto the house of the lord the third 
day 9and isaiah said  this shall be 
the sign unto thee from the lord that 20 second kings  
553 
 the lord will do the  thing that he hath 
spoken  shall the shadow go forward 
ten degrees  or go back ten degrees  
10and hezekiah answered  it is a light 
thing for the shadow to decline ten 
degrees  nay but let the shadow return 
backward ten degrees  11and isaiah 
the prophet  cried unto the lord and 
he brought the shadow ten degrees 
backward  by which it had gone down 
on the dial of ahaz   
12at that time berodach baladan the 
son of baladan  king of babylon  sent 
a letter and a present unto hezekiah  
for he had heard that heze kiah had 
been sick  13and hezekiah hearkened 
unto them  and showed them all his 
treasure house  the silver  and the 
gold and the spices  and the precious 
oil and the house of his armour  and 
all that was found in his treasures  
there was nothing in his h ouse nor in 
all his dominion  that hezekiah 
showed them not  14then came isaiah 
the prophet unto king hezekiah  and 
said unto him  what said these men  
and from whence came they unto 
thee and hezekiah said  they are 
come from a far country  even from 
babylon  15and he said  what have 
they seen in thy house  and hezekiah 
answered  all that is in my house 
have they seen  there is nothing among 
my treasures that i have not shown 
them   
16and isaiah said unto hezekiah  
hear the word of the lord 17behold 
the days come  that all that is in thy 
house  and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day  shall be 
carried to babylon  nothing shall be 
left saith the lord 18and of thy sons 
that shall issue from thee  whom thou 
shalt beget  shall they take away  and 
they shall be officers in the palace of 
the king of babylon  19then said 
hezekiah unto isaiah  good is the 
word of the lord which thou hast 
spoken  he said moreover  is it not 
so if peace and truth shall be in my 
days  
20now t he rest of the acts of 
hezekiah  and all his might  and how 
he made the pool  and the conduit  and 
brought water into the city  are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of judah  
21and hezekiah slept with his fathers  
and manasseh hi s son reigned in his 
stead   
 
manasseh was twelve years 
old when he began to reign  
and he reigned five and fifty years in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
hephzi bah 2and he did that which 
was evil in the sight of the lord after 
the abominations of the nations  whom 
the lord cast out before the children 
of israel  3for he built again the high 
places which hezekiah his father had 
destroyed  and he reared up altars for 
baal and made an asherah  as did 
ahab king of israel  and worshipped 
all the hos t of heaven  and served 
them  4and he built altars in the house 
of the lord whereof the lord said in 
jerusalem will i put my name  5and 21 second kings  
554 
 he built altars for all the host of heaven 
in the two courts of the house of the 
lord 6and he made his son to pass 
through the fire  and practised 
soothsaying  and used enchantments  
and appointed them that divined by a 
ghost or a familiar spirit  he wrought 
much evil in the sight of the lord to 
provoke him  7and he set the graven 
image of asherah  that he had made  in 
the house of which the lord said to 
david and to solomon his son  in this 
house  and in jerusalem  which i have 
chosen out of all the tribes of israel  
will i put my name for ever  8neither 
will i cause the feet of israel to wander 
any more out of the l and which i gave 
their fathers  if only they will observe 
to do according to all that i have 
commanded them  and according to all 
the law that my servant moses 
commanded them  9but they 
hearkened not  and manasseh seduced 
them to do that which is evil mor e than 
did the nations  whom the lord 
destroyed before the children of israel   
10and the lord spoke by his 
servants the prophets  saying  
11because manasseh king of judah 
hath done these abominations  and 
hath done wickedly above all that the 
amorites di d that were before him  
and hath made judah also to sin with 
his idols  12therefore thus saith the 
lord the god of israel  behold  i 
bring such evil upon jerusalem and 
judah  that whosoever heareth of it  
both his ears shall tingle  13and i will 
stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria  and the plummet of the house 
of ahab  and i will wipe jerusalem as 
a man wipeth a dish  wiping it and 
turning it upside down  14and i will 
cast off the remnant of mine 
inheritance  and deliver them into the 
hand of their  enemies  and they shall 
become a prey and a spoil to all their 
enemies  15because they have done that 
which is evil in my sight  and have 
provoked me  since the day their 
fathers came forth out of egypt  even 
unto this day   
16moreover manasseh shed inno cent 
blood very much  till he had filled 
jerusalem from one end to another  
beside his sin wherewith he made 
judah to sin  in doing that which was 
evil in the sight of the lord 17now the 
rest of the acts of manasseh  and all 
that he did  and his sin that he sinned  
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of judah  
18and manasseh slept with his fathers  
and was buried in the garden of his 
own house  in the garden of uzza  and 
amon his son reigned in his stead   
19amon was twenty and two years 
old when he began to reign  and he 
reigned two years in jerusalem  and 
his mother s name was meshullemeth 
the daughter of haruz of jotbah  20and 
he did that which was evil in the sight 
of the lord as did manasseh his 
father  21and he walked in a ll the way 
that his father walked in  and served 
the idols that his father served  and 
worshipped them  22and he forsook 
the lord the god of his fathers  and second kings  
555 
 walked not in the way of the lord 
23and the servants of amon conspired 
against him  and put the king to death 
in his own house  24but the people of 
the land slew all them that had 
conspired against king amon  and the 
people of the land made josiah his son 
king in his stead  25now the rest of the 
acts of amon which he did  are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of judah  
26and he was buried in his sepulchre 
in the garden of uzza  and josiah his 
son reigned in his stead   
josiah was eight years old 
when he began to reign  and 
he reigned thirty and one years in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
jedidah the daughter of adaiah of 
bozkath  2and he did that which was 
right in the eyes of the lord and 
walked in all the way of david his 
father  and turned not aside to the right 
hand or to the left   
3and it came to pass in the 
eighteenth year of king josiah  that the 
king sent shaphan the son of azaliah  
the son of meshullam  the scribe  to 
the house of the lord saying  4go up 
to hilkiah the high priest  that he may 
sum the money which is brought into 
the house of the lord whic h the 
keepers of the door have gathered of 
the people  5and let them deliver it into 
the hand of the workmen that have the 
oversight of the house of the lord and 
let them give it to the workmen that 
are in the house of the lord to repair 
the breaches of the house  6unto the carpenters  and to the builders  and to 
the masons  and for buying timber and 
hewn stone to repair the house  
7howbeit there was no reckoning 
made with them of the money that was 
delivered into their hand  for they dealt 
faithfully   
8and hilkiah the high priest said 
unto shaphan the scribe  i have found 
the book of the law in the house of the 
lord and hilkiah delivered the book 
to shaphan  and he read it  9and 
shaphan the scribe came to the king  
and brought back word unto the kin g 
and said  thy servants have poured 
out the money that was found in the 
house  and have delivered it into the 
hand of the workmen that have the 
oversight of the house of the lord 
10and shaphan the scribe told the 
king saying  hilkiah the priest hath  
delivered me a book  and shaphan 
read it before the king  11and it came 
to pass  when the king had heard the 
words of the book of the law  that he 
rent his clothes  12and the king 
commanded hilkiah the priest  and 
ahikam the son of shaphan  and 
achbor th e son of micaiah  and 
shaphan the scribe  and asaiah the 
kings servant  saying  13go ye  
inquire of the lord for me  and for the 
people  and for all judah  concerning 
the words of this book that is found  
for great is the wrath of the lord that 
is kindle d against us  because our 
fathers have not hearkened unto the 
words of this book  to do according 22 second kings  
556 
 unto all that which is written 
concerning us   
14so hilkiah the priest  and ahikam  
and achbor  and shaphan  and asaiah  
went unto huldah the prophetess  the 
wife of shallum the son of tikvah  the 
son of harhas  keeper of the 
wardrobe now she dwelt in 
jerusalem in the second quarter and 
they spoke with her  15and she said 
unto them  thus saith the lord the 
god of israel  tell ye the man that sent 
you unto me  16thus saith the lord 
behold  i will bring evil upon this 
place  and upon the inhabitants 
thereof  even all the words of the book 
which the king of judah hath read  
17because they have forsaken me  and 
have offered unto other gods  that they 
might provo ke me with all the work of 
their hands  therefore my wrath shall 
be kindled against this place  and it 
shall not be quenched  18but unto the 
king of judah  who sent you to inquire 
of the lord thus shall ye say to him  
thus saith the lord the god of israe l 
as touching the words which thou hast 
heard  19because thy heart was tender  
and thou didst humble thyself before 
the lord when thou heardest what i 
spoke against this place  and against 
the inhabitants thereof  that they 
should become an astonishment and a 
curse  and hast rent thy clothes  and 
wept before me  i also have heard 
thee saith the lord 20therefore  
behold  i will gather thee to thy 
fathers  and thou shalt be gathered to 
thy grave in peace  neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which i will bring 
upon this place  and they brought 
back word unto the king   
and the king sent  and they 
gathered unto him all the 
elders of judah and of jerusalem  2and 
the king went up to the house of the 
lord and all the men of judah and all 
the inhabita nts of jerusalem with him  
and the priests  and the prophets  and 
all the people  both small and great  
and he read in their ears all the words 
of the book of the covenant which was 
found in the house of the lord 3and 
the king stood on the platform  and 
made a covenant before the lord to 
walk after the lord and to keep his 
commandments  and his testimonies  
and his statutes  with all his heart  and 
all his soul  to confirm the words of 
this covenant that were written in this 
book  and all the people stoo d to the 
covenant   
4and the king commanded hilkiah 
the high priest  and the priests of the 
second order  and the keepers of the 
door to bring forth out of the temple 
of the lord all the vessels that were 
made for baal  and for the asherah  
and for all th e host of heaven  and he 
burned them without jerusalem in the 
fields of kidron  and carried the ashes 
of them unto beth el 5and he put 
down the idolatrous priests  whom the 
kings of judah had ordained to offer in 
the high places in the cities of judah  
and in the places round about 
jerusalem  them also that offered unto 
baal to the sun  and to the moon  and 23 second kings  
557 
 to the constellations  and to all the host 
of heaven  6and he brought out the 
asherah from the house of the lord 
without jerusalem  unto the brook 
kidron and burned it at the brook 
kidron  and stamped it small to 
powder  and cast the powder thereof 
upon the graves of the common 
people  7and he broke down the 
houses of the sodomites  that were in 
the house of the lord where the 
women wove coverings fo r the 
asherah  8and he brought all the 
priests out of the cities of judah  and 
defiled the high places where the 
priests had made offerings  from geba 
to beer sheba  and he broke down the 
high places of the gates that were at 
the entrance of the gate of jo shua the 
governor of the city  which were on a 
mans left hand as he entered the gate 
of the city  9nevertheless the priests of 
the high places came not up to the altar 
of the lord in jerusalem  but they did 
eat unleavened bread among their 
brethren  10and he defiled topheth  
which is in the valley of the son of 
hinnom  that no man might make his 
son or his daughter to pass through the 
fire to molech  11and he took away the 
horses that the kings of judah had 
given to the sun  at the entrance of the 
house of  the lord by the chamber of 
nethan melech the officer  which was 
in the precincts  and he burned the 
chariots of the sun with fire  12and the 
altars that were on the roof of the 
upper chamber of ahaz  which the 
kings of judah had made  and the altars whic h manasseh had made in 
the two courts of the house of the 
lord did the king break down  and 
beat them down from thence  and cast 
the dust of them into the brook kidron  
13and the high places that were before 
jerusalem  which were on the right 
hand of the mount of corruption  
which solomon the king of israel had 
builded for ashtoreth the detestation 
of the zidonians  and for chemosh the 
detestation of moab  and for milcom 
the abomination of the children of 
ammon  did the king defile  14and he 
broke in piece s the pillars  and cut 
down the asherim  and filled their 
places with the bones of men   
15moreover the altar that was at 
beth el and the high place which 
jeroboam the son of nebat  who made 
israel to sin  had made  even that altar 
and the high place he b roke down  and 
he burned the high place and stamped 
it small to powder  and burned the 
asherah  16and as josiah turned 
himself  he spied the sepulchres that 
were there in the mount  and he sent  
and took the bones out of the 
sepulchres  and burned them upo n the 
altar and defiled it  according to the 
word of the lord which the man of 
god proclaimed  who proclaimed 
these things  17then he said  what 
monument is that which i see and the 
men of the city told him  it is the 
sepulchre of the man of god  who 
came from judah  and proclaimed 
these things that thou hast done against 
the altar of beth el 18and he said  second kings  
558 
 let him be  let no man move his 
bones  so they let his bones alone  
with the bones of the prophet that 
came out of samaria  19and all the 
houses also of the high places that 
were in the cities of samaria  which 
the kings of israel had made to 
provoke the lord josiah took away  
and did to them according to all the 
acts that he had done in beth el 20and 
he slew all the priests of the high 
places that were there  upon the altars  
and burned men s bones upon them  
and he returned to jerusalem   
21and the king commanded all the 
people  saying  keep the passover 
unto the lord your god  as it is 
written in this book of the covenant  
22for there was n ot kept such a 
passover from the days of the judges 
that judged israel  nor in all the days of 
the kings of israel  nor of the kings of 
judah  23but in the eighteenth year of 
king josiah was this passover kept to 
the lord in jerusalem  24moreover 
them that  divined by a ghost or a 
familiar spirit  and the teraphim  and 
the idols  and all the detestable things 
that were spied in the land of judah 
and in jerusalem  did josiah put away  
that he might confirm the words of the 
law which were written in the book 
that hilkiah the priest found in the 
house of the lord 25and like unto him 
was there no king before him  that 
turned to the lord with all his heart  
and with all his soul  and with all his 
might  according to all the law of moses  neither after him arose t here 
any like him   
26notwithstanding the lord turned 
not from the fierceness of his great 
wrath  wherewith his anger was 
kindled against judah  because of all 
the provocations wherewith manasseh 
had provoked him  27and the lord 
said i will remove judah also out of 
my sight  as i have removed israel  
and i will cast off this city which i 
have chosen  even jerusalem  and the 
house of which i said  my name shall 
be there   
28now the rest of the acts of josiah  
and all that he did  are they not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of judah  29in his days pharaoh 
necoh king of egypt went up against 
the king of assyria to the river 
euphrates  and king josiah went 
against him  and he slew him at 
megiddo  when he had seen him

and zedekia h rebelled against the  
king of babylon  1and it came

overtook him in the plains of jericho  
and all his army was scattered from 
him 6then they took the king  and 
carried him up unto the king of

judgment upon him  7and they slew 
the sons of zedekiah before his eyes  
and put out the eyes of zedekiah  and 
bound him in fetters  and carried him

away  that fell to the king of babylon  
and the residue of the multitude  did 
nebuza radan the captain of the guard

of the guard left of the poorest of the 
land to be vinedressers and 
husbandmen   
13and the pillars of brass that were 
in the house of the lord and the bases 
and the brazen sea that were in the 
house of the lord did the chaldeans 
break in pieces  and carried the brass 
of them to babylon  14and the pots  
and the shovels  and the snuffers  and 
the pans  and all the vessels of brass 
wherewith they ministered  took they 
away  15and the fire pans and the 
basins  that which was of gold  in gold  
and that which was of silver  in silver  
the captain of the guard took away  
16the two pillars  the one sea  and the 
bases  which solomon had made for 
the house of the lord the brass of all 
these vesse ls was without weight  
17the height of the one pillar was 
eighteen cubits  and a capital of brass 
was upon it  and the height of the 
capital was three cubits  with network 
and pomegranates upon the capital 
round about  all of brass  and like unto 
these had  the second pillar with 
network   18and the captain of the guard took 
seraiah the chief priest  and zephaniah

of the door  19and out of the city he 
took an officer that was set over the 
men of war  and five men of t hem that

in the city  and the scribe of the 
captain of the host  who mustered the 
people of the land  and threescore men 
of the people of the land  that were 
found in the city  20and nebuzaradan 
the captain of the guard took them  and 
brought them to the king of babylon to 
riblah  21and the king of babylon 
smote them  and put them to death at 
riblah in the land of hamath  so 
judah was carried away captive out of 
his land  22and as for the people that 
were left in the land  of judah  whom 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had 
left even over them he made gedaliah 
the son of ahikam  the son of 
shaphan  governor   
23now when all the captains of the 
forces  they and their men  heard that 
the king of babylon had made 
gedaliah gover nor they came to 
gedaliah to mizpah  even ishmael the 
son of nethaniah  and johanan the son 
of kareah  and seraiah the son of 
tanhumeth the netophathite and 
jaazaniah the son of the maacathite  
they and their men  24and gedaliah 
swore to them and to their  men and 
said unto them  fear not because of 
the servants of the chaldeans  dwell in 
the land  and serve the king of 
babylon  and it shall be well with second kings  
562 
 you 25but it came to pass in the 
seventh month  that ishmael the son of 
nethaniah  the son of elisha ma of the 
seed royal  came  and ten men with 
him and smote gedaliah  that he died  
and the jews and the chaldeans that 
were with him at mizpah  26and all the 
people  both small and great  and the 
captains of the forces  arose  and came 
to egypt  for they  were afraid of the 
chaldeans   
27and it came to pass in the seven 
and thirtieth year of the captivity of 
jehoiachin king of judah  in the 
twelfth month  on the seven and twentieth day of the month  that evil 
merodach king of babylon  in the year 
that he b egan to reign  did lift up the 
head of jehoiachin king of judah out 
of prison  28and he spoke kindly to 
him and set his throne above the 
throne of the kings that were with him 
in babylon  29and he changed his 
prison garments  and did eat bread 
before him continually all the days of 
his life  30and for his allowance  there 
was a continual allowance given him 
of the king  every day a portion  all the 
days of his life

but israel doth not know   
my people doth not consider

a people laden with iniquity   
a seed of evil doers   
children that deal corruptly   
they have forsaken the lord  
they have contemned the holy on e

they are turned away backward   
5on what part will ye yet be 
stricken   
seeing ye stray away more and 
more   
the whole head is sick   
and the whole heart faint   
6from the sole of the foot even unto

ye rulers of sodom   
give ear unto the law of our god   
ye people of gomorrah   
11to what purpose is the multitude 
of your sacrifices unto me   
saith the lord  
i am full of the burnt offerings o f 
rams   
and the fat of fed beasts    1 isaiah  
564 
 and i delight not in the blood  
of bullocks  or of lambs  or of he 
goats   
12when ye come to appear before 
me  
who hath required this at your hand   
to trample my courts

my soul hateth

i am weary to bear them   
15and when ye spread forth your

18come now  and let us reason 
together   
saith the lord  
though your sins be as scarlet   
they shall be as white as snow   though they be red like  crimson   
they shall be as wool   
19if ye be willing and obedient   
ye shall eat the good of the land   
20but if ye refuse and rebel   
ye shall be devoured with the 
sword   
for the mouth of the lord hath 
spoken   
 
21how is the faithful city  
become a harl ot  
she that was full of justice   
righteousness lodged in her   
but now murderers   
22thy silver is become dross   
thy wine mixed with water   
23thy princes are rebellious   
and companions of thieves   
every one loveth bribes   
and followeth after reward s  
they judge not the fatherless   
neither doth the cause of the widow 
come unto them   
 
24therefore saith the lord  the lord 
of hosts   
the mighty one of israel   
ah i will ease me of mine 
adversaries   
and avenge me of mine enemies   
25and i will turn my hand upon 
thee  
and purge away thy dross as with 
lye  
and will take away all thine alloy   
26and i will restore thy judges as at

 and thy counsellors as at the 
beginning   
afterward thou shalt be called the 
city of righteousness

justice

 righteousness   
28but the destruction of the 
transgressors and the sinners shall 
be together

be consumed   
29for they shall be asha med of the  
 terebinths which ye have desired   
and ye shall be confounded for the 
gardens that ye have chosen   
30for ye shall be as a terebinth 
whose leaf fadeth   
and as a garden that hath no water   
31and the strong shall be as tow   
and his work as a spark   
and they shall both burn together   
and none shall quench them   
 
the word that isaiah the son of 
amoz saw concerning judah and 
jerusalem   
 
2and it shall come to pass in the end 
of days   
that the mountain of the l ords 
house  
shall be establish ed as the top of the 
mountains   
and shall be exalted above the hills   
and all nations shall flow unto it   3and many peoples shall go and 
say  
come ye  and let us go up to the 
mountain of the lord  
to the house of the god of jacob   
and he will teach us of his ways   
and we will walk in his paths   
for out of zion shall go forth the 
law  
and the word of the lord from 
jerusalem

us walk  
in the light of the lord  
6for thou hast forsaken thy people 
the house of ja cob  
for they are replenished from the 
east  
and with soothsayers like the 
philistines

9and man boweth down   
and man lowereth himself   
and thou canst not be ar with them   
10enter into the rock   
and hide thee in the dust   
from before the terror of the lord  
and from the glory of his majesty   
11the lofty looks of man shall be 
brought low   
and the haughtiness of men shall be 
bowed down   
and the lord alone shall be exalted 
in that day   
 
12for the lord of hosts hath a day  
upon all that is proud and lofty   
and upon all that is lifted up  and it 
shall be brought low   
13and upon all the cedars of 
lebanon  
that are high and lifted up   
and upon all the oaks o f bashan   
14and upon all the high mountains   
and upon all the hills that are lifted 
up 15and upon every lofty tower   
and upon every fortified wall   
16and upon all the ships of tarshish   
and upon all delightful imagery   
17and the loftiness of man sha ll be 
bowed down   
and the haughtiness of men shall be 
brought low   and the lord alone shall be exalted 
in that  day  
 
18and the idols shall utterly pass 
away   
19and men shall go into the caves of 
the rocks   
and into the holes of the earth   
from before  the terror of the lord  
and from the glory of his majesty   
when he ariseth to shake mightily 
the earth   
20in that day a man shall cast away  
his idols of silver  and his idols of 
gold  
which they made for themselves to 
worship   
to the moles and to th e bats   
21to go into the clefts of the rocks

22cease ye from man  in whose 
nostrils is a breath   
for how little is he to be accounted   
 
for behold  the lord  the lord of 
 hosts   
doth take away from jerusalem and 
from judah

every stay of bread  and every stay 
of water

war  
the judge  and the p rophet   3 isaiah

rank  
and the counsellor  and the cunning 
charmer  and the skilful

4and i will give children to be their 
princes   
and babes shall rule over them   
5and the people  shall oppress one 
another   
every man his fellow  and every 
man his neighbour   
the child shall behave insolently 
against the aged   
and the base against the 
honourable   
6for a man shall take hold of his 
brother of the house of his father   
thou hast a mantle   
be thou our ruler   
and let this ruin be under thy hand   
7in that day shall he swear  saying   
i will not be a healer   
for in my house is neither bread nor 
a mantle   
ye shall not make me ruler of a 
people   
8for jerusalem is ruined   
and jud ah is fallen   
because their tongue and their 
doings are against the lord  
to provoke the eyes of his glory   
 
9the show of their countenance doth 
witness against them   
and they declare their sin as 
sodom  they hide it not   
woe unto their soul   for the y have wrought evil unto 
themselves   
10say ye of the righteous  that it 
shall be well with him   
for they shall eat the fruit of their 
doings   
11woe unto the wicked  it shall be ill 
with him   
for the work of his hands shall be 
done to him   
12as for my people  a babe is their 
master   
and women rule over them   
o my people  they that lead thee 
cause thee to err   
and destroy the way of thy paths   
 
13the lord standeth up to plead   
and standeth to judge the peoples   
14the lord will enter into judgment  
with the elders of his people  and 
the princes thereof   
it is ye that have eaten up the 
vineyard  the spoil of the poor is 
in your houses   
15what mean ye that ye crush my 
people   
and grind the face of the poor   
saith the lord  the g od of hosts   
16moreover the lord said  
because the daughters of zion are 
haughty   
and walk with stretched forth necks  
and wanton eyes   
walking and mincing as they go   
and making a tinkling with their 
feet  
17therefore the lord will smite with 
a scab  isaiah  
568 
 the crown of the  head of the 
daughters of zion   
and the lord will lay bare their 
secret parts   
18in that day the lord will take away 
the bravery of their anklets  and the 
fillets  and the crescents  19the 
pendants  and the bracelets  and the 
veils  20the headtires  and the armlets  
and the sashes  and the corselets  and 
the amulets  21the rings  and the nose 
jewels  22the aprons  and the mantelets  
and the cloaks  and the girdles  23and 
the gauze robes  and the fine linen  and 
the turbans  and the mantles  24and it 
shall  come to pass  that  
instead of sweet spices there shall 
be rottenness   
and instead of a girdle rags   
and instead of curled hair baldness   
and instead of a stomacher a 
girding of sackcloth   
branding instead of beauty   
25thy men shall fall by the sword   
and thy mighty in the war   
26and her gates shall lament and 
mourn   
and utterly bereft she shall sit upon 
the ground   
 
and seven women shall take hold 
of one man in that day  saying  
we will eat our own bread  and wear 
our own apparel  only let us be called 
by thy name  take thou away our 
reproach   
2in that day shall the growth of the 
lord be beautiful and glorious   and the fruit of the land excellent 
and comely  
for them that are escaped of israel   
3and it shall come to pass  that he 
that is le ft in zion  and he that 
remaineth in jerusalem  shall be called 
holy even every one that is written 
unto life in jerusalem  4when the lord 
shall have washed away the filth of the 
daughters of zion  and shall have 
purged the blood of jerusalem from 
the mid st thereof  by the spirit of 
judgment  and by the spirit of 
destruction  5and the lord will create 
over the whole habitation of mount 
zion  and over her assemblies  a cloud 
and smoke by day  and the shining of a 
flaming fire by night  for over all the 
glory shall be a canopy  6and there 
shall be a pavilion for a shadow in the 
daytime from the heat  and for a 
refuge and for a covert from storm and 
from rain   
 
let me sing of my well beloved   
a song of my beloved touching 
 his vineyard   
my well beloved h ad a vineyard  
in a very fruitful hill   
2and he digged it  and cleared it of 
stones   
and planted it with the choicest 
vine  
and built a tower in the midst of it   
and also hewed out a vat therein   
and he looked that it should bring 
forth grapes   
and it brought forth wild grapes   
 4 5 isaiah  
569 
 3and now  o inhabitants of 
jerusalem and men of judah   
judge  i pray you  betwixt me and 
my vineyard   
4what could have been done more 
to my vineyard   
that i have not done in it   
wherefore  when i looked that it 
should bri ng forth grapes   
brought it forth wild grapes   
 
5and now come  i will tell you  
what i will do to my vineyard   
i will take away the hedge thereof   
and it shall be eaten up   
i will break down the fence thereof   
and it shall be trodden down   
6and i wi ll lay it waste   
it shall not be pruned nor hoed   
but there shall come up briers and 
thorns   
i will also command the clouds  
that they rain no rain upon it   
 
7for the vineyard of the lord of 
hosts is the house of israel   
and the men of judah the plant  of 
his delight   
and he looked for justice  but 
behold violence   
for righteousness  but behold a cry   
 
8woe unto them that join house to 
house   
that lay field to field   
till there be no room  and ye be 
made to dwell  
alone in the midst of the land   
9in mine ears said the lord of hosts   of a truth many houses shall be 
desolate   
even great and fair  without 
inhabitant   
10for ten acres of vineyard shall 
yield one bath   
and the seed of a homer shall yield 
an ephah   
 
11woe unto them that rise up early  
in the morning   
that they may follow strong drink   
that tarry late into the night   
till wine inflame them   
12and the harp and the psaltery  the 
tabret and the pipe   
and wine  are in their feasts   
but they regard not the work of the 
lord  
neither ha ve they considered the 
operation of his hands   
13therefore my people are gone into 
captivity   
for want of knowledge   
and their honourable men are 
famished   
and their multitude are parched 
with thirst   
14therefore the nether world hath 
enlarged her des ire  
and opened her mouth without 
measure   
and down goeth their glory  and 
their tumult  and their uproar   
and he that rejoiceth among them   
15and man is bowed down   
and man is humbled   
and the eyes of the lofty are 
humbled   isaiah  
570 
 16but the lord of hosts is exalted 
through justice   
and god the holy one is sanctified 
through righteousness   
17then shall the lambs feed as in 
their pasture   
and the waste places of the fat ones 
shall wanderers eat   
 
18woe unto them that draw iniquity 
with cords of vanity   
and sin as it were with a cart rope   
19that say  let him make speed  let 
him hasten his work   
that we may see it   
and let the counsel of the holy one 
of israel draw nigh and come   
that we may know it    
 
20woe unto them that call evil good   
and good  evil  
that change darkness into light   
and light into darkness   
that change bitter into sweet   
and sweet into bitter   
 
21woe unto them that are wise in 
their own eyes   
and prudent in their own sight   
 
22woe unto them that are mighty to 
drink wine   
and men of strength to mingle 
strong drink   
23that justify the wicked for a 
reward   
and take away the righteousness of 
the righteous from him   24therefore as the tongue of fire 
devoureth the stubble   
and as the chaff is consumed in the 
flame   
so thei r root shall be as rottenness   
and their blossom shall go up as 
dust  
because they have rejected the law 
of the lord of hosts   
and contemned the word of the 
holy one of israel   
 
25therefore is the anger of the lord 
kindled against his people   
and he h ath stretched forth his 
hand against them  and hath 
smitten them   
and the hills did tremble   
and their carcasses were as refuse 
in the midst of the streets   
for all this his anger is not turned 
away   
but his hand is stretched out still   
 
26and he will  lift up an ensign to 
the nations from far   
and will hiss unto them from the 
end of the earth   
and behold  they shall come with 
speed swiftly   
27none shall be weary nor stumble 
among them   
none shall slumber nor sleep   
neither shall the girdle of the ir loins 
be loosed   
nor the latchet of their shoes be 
broken  28whose arrows are 
sharp   
and all their bows bent   isaiah  
571 
 their horses hoofs shall be counted 
like flint   
and their wheels like a whirlwind   
29their roaring shall be like a lion   
they shall roar like young lions  
yea they shall roar   
and lay hold of the prey  and carry 
it away safe   
and there shall be none to deliver   
30and they shall roar against them in 
that day  
like the roaring of the sea   
and if one look unto the land   
behold darkness a nd distress   
and the light is darkened in the 
skies thereof   
 
in the year that king uzziah died i 
saw the lord sitting upon a throne 
high and lifted up  and his train filled 
the temple  2above him stood the 
seraphim  each one had six wings  
with twain he covered his face and 
with twain he covered his feet  and 
with twain he did fly  3and one called 
unto another  and said   
holy  holy holy is the lord of 
hosts   
the whole earth is full of his glory   
4and the posts of the door were 
moved at the voice o f them that called  
and the house was filled with smoke  
5then said i   
woe is me  for i am undone   
because i am a man of unclean lips   
and i dwell in the midst of a people 
of  
unclean lips   
for mine eyes have seen the king   the lord of hosts   
6then f lew unto me one of the 
seraphim  with a glowing stone in his 
hand  which he had taken with the 
tongs from off the altar  7and he 
touched my mouth with it  and said   
lo this hath touched thy lips   
and thine iniquity is taken away   
and thy sin expiated   
8and i heard the voice of the lord  
saying   
whom shall i send   
and who will go for us   
then i said  here am i  send me  
9and he said  go and tell this 
people   
hear ye indeed  but understand not   
and see ye indeed  but perceive not   
10make the he art of this people fat   
and make their ears heavy   
and shut their eyes   
lest they  seeing with their eyes   
and hearing with their ears   
and understanding with their heart   
rreturn  and be healed   
11then said i  lord  how long  
and he answered   
until cities be waste without 
inhabitant   
and houses without man   
and the land become utterly waste   
12and the lord have removed men 
far away   
and the forsaken places be many in 
the midst of the land   
13and if there be yet a tenth in it  it 
shall agai n be eaten up  as a terebinth  
and as an oak  whose stock remaineth  6 isaiah  
572 
 when they cast their leaves  so the holy 
seed shall be the stock thereof   
 
and it came to pass in the days of 
ahaz the son of jotham  the son 
of uzziah  king of judah  that rezin 
the king of aram  and pekah the son of 
remaliah  king of israel  went up to 
jerusalem to war against it  but could 
not prevail against it  2and it was told 
the house of david  saying  aram is 
confederate with ephraim  and his 
heart was moved  and the heart o f his 
people  as the trees of the forest are 
moved with the wind   
3then said the lord unto isaiah  
go forth now to meet ahaz  thou and 
ashear jashub thy son  at the end of the 
conduit of the upper pool  in the 
highway of the fullers field 4and say 
unto him keep calm  and be quiet  
fear not  neither let thy heart be faint  
because of these two tails of smoking 
firebrands  for the fierce anger of 
rezin and aram  and of the son of 
remaliah  5because aram hath 
counselled evil against thee  ephraim 
also and the son of remaliah  saying  
6let us go up against judah  and vex it  
and let us make a breach therein for us  
and set up a king in the midst of it  
even the son of tabeel  7thus saith the 
lord g od  
it shall not stand  neither shall it 
come to pass   
8for the head of aram is damascus   
and the head of damascus is rezin   
                                                      
a that is a remnant shall return  and within threescore and five 
years  
shall ephraim be broken  that it be 
not a people   
9and the head of ephraim is 
samaria   
and the head of samaria is 
remaliah s son   
if ye will not have faith  surely ye 
shall not be established   
 
10and the lord spoke again unto 
ahaz  saying  11ask thee a sign of the 
lord thy god  ask it either in the 
depth  or in the height above  12but 
ahaz said  i will not ask  neither will 
i try the lord 13and he said  hear ye 
now o house of david  is it a small 
thing for you to weary men  that ye 
will weary my god also  14therefore 
the lord himself shall give you a sign  
behold  the young woman shall 
conceive  and bear a son  and shall call 
his name bimma nuel 15curd and 
honey shall he eat  when he knoweth 
to refuse the evil  and choose the good  
16yea before the child shall know to 
refuse the evil  and choose the good  
the land whose two kings thou hast a 
horror of shall be forsaken  17the lord 
shall bri ng upon thee  and upon thy 
people  and upon thy father s house  
days that have not come  from the day 
that ephraim departed from judah  
even the king of assyria   
18and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
                                                      
b that is god is wi th us  7 isaiah  
573 
 that the lord shall hiss for the fly  
that is in t he uttermost part of the 
rivers of egypt   
and for the bee that is in the land of  
assyria   
19and they shall come  and shall rest 
all of them  
in the rugged valleys  and in the 
holes of the rocks   
and upon all thorns  and upon all 
brambles   
20in that da y shall the lord shave 
with a razor that is hired in the parts 
beyond the river  even with the king 
of assyria  the head and the hair of the 
feet and it shall also sweep away the 
beard   
21and it shall come to pass in that 
day that a man shall rear a you ng cow  
and two sheep  22and it shall come to 
pass for the abundance of milk that 
they shall give  he shall eat curd  for 
curd and honey shall every one eat that 
is left in the midst of the land   
23and it shall come to pass in that 
day that every place  where there were 
a thousand vines at a thousand 
silverlings  shall even be for briers and 
thorns  24with arrows and with bow 
shall one come thither  because all the 
land shall become briers and thorns  
25and all the hills that were digged 
with the mattock  thou shalt not come 
thither for fear of briers and thorns  but 
it shall be for the sending forth of 
oxen  and for the treading of sheep   
 
and the lord said unto me  take 
thee a great tablet  and write upon it in common script  the spoil 
speedeth  the prey hasteth  2and i will 
take unto me faithful witnesses to 
record  uriah the priest  and zechariah 
the son of jeberechiah  3and i went 
unto the prophetess  and she 
conceived  and bore a son  then said 
the lord unto me  call his name 
amaher shalal hashbaz 4for before the 
child shall have knowledge to cry  my 
father  and my mother  the riches of 
damascus and the spoil of samaria 
shall be carried away before the king 
of assyria   
5and the lord spoke unto me yet 
again  saying   
6forasmuch as this people  hath 
refused  
the waters of shiloah that go softly   
and rejoiceth with rezin and 
remaliah s son   
7now therefore  behold  the lord 
bringeth up upon them  
the waters of the river  mighty and 
many   
even the king of assyria and all his 
glory  
and he shall come up over all his  
 channels   
and go over all his banks   
8and he shall sweep through judah  
overflowing as he passeth through  
he shall reach even to the neck   
and the stretching out of his wings  
shall fill the breadth of thy land  o 
immanuel   
                                                      
a that is the spoil speedeth the 
prey hasteth  8 isaiah  
574 
  
9make an uproar  o ye peoples  and 
ye shall be broken in pieces   
and give ear  all ye of far countries   
gird yourselves  and ye shall be 
broken in pieces   
gird yourselves  and ye shall be 
broken in pieces   
10take counsel together  and it shall 
be brought to nought   
speak the word  and it shall not 
stand   
for god is with us   
11for the lord spoke thus to me 
with a strong hand  admonishing me 
that i should not walk in the way of 
this people  saying  12say ye not  a 
conspiracy  concerning all whereof 
this people do say  a conspiracy  
neither fear ye their fear  nor account it 
dreadful  13the lord of hosts  him 
shall ye sanctify  and let him be your 
fear and let him be your dread  14and 
he shall be for a sanctuary  but for a 
stone of stumbling and for a roc k of 
offence to both the houses of israel  
for a gin and for a snare to the 
inhabitants of jerusalem  15and many 
among them shall stumble  and fall  
and be broken  and be snared  and be 
taken   
16bind up the testimony  seal the 
instruction among my disci ples 
17and i will wait for the lord that 
hideth his face from the house of 
jacob  and i will look for him  
18behold  i and the children whom the 
lord hath given me shall be for signs 
and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts  who dwelleth in moun t 
zion  19and when they shall say unto 
you seek unto the ghosts and the 
familiar spirits  that chirp and that 
mutter  should not a people seek unto 
their god  on behalf of the living unto 
the dead 20for instruction and for 
testimony surely they will sp eak 
according to this word  wherein there 
is no light  21and they shall pass this 
way that are sore bestead and hungry  
and it shall come to pass that  when 
they shall be hungry  they shall fret 
themselves  and curse by their king 
and by their god  and whether they 
turn their faces upward  22or look unto 
the earth  behold distress and darkness  
the gloom of anguish  and outspread 
thick darkness  23for is there no gloom 
to her that was stedfast  now the 
former hath lightly afflicted the land of 
zebulun and  the land of naphtali  but 
the latter hath dealt a more grievous 
blow by the way of the sea  beyond the 
jordan  in the district of the nations   
 
the people that walked in 
darkness have seen a great light   
they that dwelt in the land of the 
shadow of de ath  
upon them hath the light shined   
2thou hast multiplied the nation   
thou hast increased their joy   
they joy before thee according to 
the joy in harvest   
as men rejoice when they divide the 
spoil   
3for the yoke of his burden   
and the staff of his  shoulder   9 isaiah  
575 
 the rod of his oppressor   
thou hast broken as in the day of 
midian   
for every boot stamped with 
fierceness   
and every cloak rolled in blood   
shall even be for burning  for fuel of 
fire  
5for a child is born unto us   
a son is given unto us   
and the government is upon his 
shoulder   
and his name is called  
apelejoezelgibbor  
abiadsarshalom   
6that the government may be 
increased  and of peace there be 
no end   
upon the throne of david  and upon 
his kingdom   
to establish it  and to up hold it  
through justice and through 
righteousness from henceforth 
even for ever   
the zeal of the lord of hosts doth 
perform this   
 
7the lord sent a word into jacob   
and it hath lighted upon israel   
8and all the people shall know   
even ephraim and the  inhabitant of 
samaria   
that say in pride and in arrogancy 
of heart   
                                                      
a that is wonderful in counsel is 
god the mighty the everlasting 
father the ruler of peace  9the bricks are fallen  but we will 
build with hewn stones   
the sycamores are cut down  but 
cedars will we put in their place   
10therefore the lord doth set upon 
high the adversarie s of rezin 
against him   
and spur his enemies   
11the arameans on the east  and the 
philistines on the west   
and they devour israel with open 
mouth   
for all this his anger is not turned 
away   
but his hand is stretched out still   
 
12yet the people turne th not unto 
him that smiteth them   
neither do they seek the lord of 
hosts   
13therefore the lord doth cut off 
from israel head and tail   
palmbranch and rush  in one day   
14the elder and the man of rank  he 
is the head   
and the prophet that teacheth li es 
he is the tail   
15for they that lead this people 
cause them to err   
and they that are led of them are 
destroyed   
16therefore the lord shall have no 
joy in their young men   
neither shall he have compassion 
on their fatherless and widows   
for every one is ungodly and an 
evildoer  
and every mouth speaketh 
wantonness   isaiah  
576 
 for all this his anger is not turned 
away   
but his hand is stretched out still   
 
17 for wickedness burneth as the 
fire  
it devoureth the briers and thorns   
yea it kindleth in the thickets of the 
forest   
and they roll upward in thick clouds 
of smoke   
18through the wrath of the lord of 
hosts is the land burnt up   
the people also are as the fuel of 
fire  
no man spareth his brother   
19and one snatcheth on the right 
hand  and is hu ngry  
and he eateth on the left hand  and 
is not satisfied   
they eat every man the flesh of his 
own arm   
20manasseh  ephraim  and ephraim  
manasseh   
and they together are against judah   
for all this his anger is not turned 
away   
but his hand is stret ched out still   
 
woe unto them that decree 
 unrighteous decrees   
and to the writers that write 
iniquity   
2to turn aside the needy from 
judgment   
and to take away the right of the 
poor of my people   
that widows may be their spoil   and that they may  make the 
fatherless their prey   
3and what will ye do in the day of 
visitation   
and in the ruin which shall come 
from far   
to whom will ye flee for help   
and where will ye leave your glory   
4they can do nought except crouch 
under the captives   
and fa ll under the slain   
for all this his anger is not turned 
away   
but his hand is stretched out still   
 
5o asshur  the rod of mine anger   
in whose hand as a staff is mine 
indignation   
6i do send him against an ungodly 
nation  and against the people of my  
wrath do i give him a charge   
to take the spoil  and to take the 
prey  
and to tread them down like the 
mire of the streets   
7howbeit he meaneth not so   
neither doth his heart think so   
but it is in his heart to destroy   
and to cut off nations not a few  
8for he saith  are not my princes 
all of them kings   
9is not calno as carchemish   
is not hamath as arpad   
is not samaria as damascus   
10as my hand hath reached the 
kingdoms of the idols   
whose graven images did exceed 
them of jerusalem and of s amaria   
11shall i not  as i have done unto 10 isaiah  
577 
 samaria and her idols   
so do to jerusalem and her idols  
12wherefore it shall come to pass  that 
when the lord hath performed his 
whole work upon mount zion and on 
jerusalem  i will punish the fruit of the 
arrogant heart of the king of assyria  
and the glory of his haughty looks  
13for he hath said   
by the strength of my hand i have 
done it   
and by my wisdom  for i am 
prudent   
in that i have removed the bounds 
of the peoples   
and have robbed their treasures   
and have brought down as one 
mighty the inhabitants   
14and my hand hath found as a nest 
the riches of the peoples   
and as one gathereth eggs that are 
forsaken   
have i gathered all the earth   
and there was none that moved the 
wing  or that opened mout h or 
chirped   
 
15should the axe boast itself against 
him that heweth therewith   
should the saw magnify itself 
against him that moveth it   
as if a rod should move them that 
lift it up   
or as if a staff should lift up him 
that is not wood   
16therefore will the lord  the lord 
of hosts   
send among his fat ones leanness   and under his glory there shall be 
kindled  
a burning like the burning of fire   
17and the light of israel shall be for 
a fire   
and his holy one for a flame   
and it shall burn and devo ur his 
thorns  
and his briers in one day   
18and the glory of his forest and of 
his fruitful field   
he will consume both soul and 
body   
and it shall be as when a sick man 
wasteth away   
19and the remnant of the trees of his 
forest shall be few   
that a c hild may write them down   
 
20and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that the remnant of israel   
and they that are escaped of the 
house of jacob   
shall no more again stay upon him 
that smote them   
but shall stay upon the lord the 
holy one of israel  in truth   
21 aa remnant shall return  even the 
remnant of jacob   
unto god the mighty   
22for though thy people  o israel  be 
as the sand of the sea   
only a remnant of them shall return   
an extermination is determined  
overflowing with righteousness   
                                                      
a heb shear jashub  isaiah  
578 
 23for an extermination wholly 
determined  
shall the lord  the g od of hosts  
make in the midst of all the earth   
 
24therefore thus saith the lord  the 
god of hosts  o my people that 
dwellest in zion  be not afraid of 
asshur  though he smite thee with the 
rod and lift up his staff against thee  
after the manner of egypt  25for yet a 
very little while  and the indignation 
shall be accomplished  and mine anger 
shall be to their destruction  26and the 
lord of hosts shall stir up against him 
a scourge  as in the slaughter of 
midian at the rock of oreb  and as 
his rod was over the sea  so shall he 
lift it up after the manner of egypt  
27and it shall come to pass in that day  
that  
his burden shall depart from off thy 
shoulder   
and his yoke from off thy neck   
and the yoke shall be destroyed by 
reason of fatness   
28he is come to aiath   
he is passed through migron   
at michmas he layeth up his 
baggage   
29they are gone over the pass   
they have taken up their lodging at

hearken  o laish  o thou poor 
anathoth   
31madmenah is in mad flight   the inhabitants of gebim flee to 
cover   
32this very day shall he halt at nob   
shaking his hand at the mount of the 
daughter o f zion   
the hill of jerusalem   
 
33behold  the lord  the lord of 
hosts   
shall lop the boughs with terror   
and the high ones of stature shall be 
hewn down   
and the lofty shall be laid low   
34and he shall cut down the 
thickets of the forest with iron   
and lebanon shall fall by a mighty 
one  
 
and there shall come forth a 
shoot out of the stock of   
    jesse   
and a twig shall grow forth out of 
his roots   
2and the spirit of the lord shall rest 
upon him   
the spirit of wisdom and 
understanding   
the spirit of counsel and might   
the spirit of knowledge and of the 
fear of the lord  
3and his delight shall be in the fear 
of the lord  
and he shall not judge after the 
sight of his eyes   
neither decide after the hearing of 
his ears   
4but with righteousn ess shall he 
judge the poor   11 isaiah  
579 
 and decide with equity for the meek 
of the land   
and he shall smite the land with the 
rod of his mouth   
and with the breath of his lips shall 
he slay the wicked   
5and righteousness shall be the 
girdle of his loins   
and fai thfulness the girdle of his 
reins   
6and the wolf shall dwell with the 
lamb   
and the leopard shall lie down with 
the kid   
and the calf and the young lion and 
the fatling together   
and a little child shall lead them   
7and the cow and the bear feed   
their young ones shall lie down 
together   
and the lion shall eat straw like the 
ox  
8and the sucking child shall play on 
the hole of the asp   
and the weaned child shall put his 
hand on the basilisk s den   
9they shall not hurt nor destroy  
in all my holy m ountain   
for the earth shall be full of the 
knowledge of the lord  
as the waters cover the sea   
 
10and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that the root of jesse  that standeth 
for an ensign of the peoples   
unto him shall the nations seek   
and his res tingplace shall be 
glorious    
11and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that the lord will set his hand 
again the second time  
to recover the remnant of his 
people   
that shall remain from assyria  and 
from egypt   
and from pathros  and from cush  
and fr om elam   
and from shinar  and from hamath  
and from the islands of the sea   
12and he will set up an ensign for 
the nations   
and will assemble the dispersed of 
israel   
and gather together the scattered of 
judah  
from the four corners of the earth   
13the envy also of ephraim shall 
depart   
and they that harass judah shall be 
cut off   
ephraim shall not envy judah   
and judah shall not vex ephraim   
14and they shall fly down upon the 
shoulder of the philistines on the 
west  
together shall they spoil the 
children of the east   
they shall put forth their hand upon 
edom and moab   
and the children of ammon shall 
obey them   
15and the lord will utterly destroy 
the tongue of the egyptian sea   isaiah  
580 
 and with his scorching wind will 
he shake his hand over the 
river   
and will smite it into seven streams   
and cause men to march over dry 
shod   
16and there shall be a highway for 
the remnant of his people   
that shall remain from assyria   
like as there was for israel  
in the day that he came up out of the 
land of egypt   
 
and in that day thou shalt say   
i will give thanks unto thee  
  o  lord  
for though thou was angry with 
me  
thine anger is turned away  and 
thou comfortest me   
2behold  god is my salvation   
i will trust  and will not be afraid   
for g od the lord is my strength and 
song   
and he is become my salvation   
3therefore with joy shall ye draw 
water  
out of the wells of salvation   
4and in that day shall ye say   
give thanks unto the lord 
proclaim his name   
declare his doings among the 
peoples   
make mention that his name is 
exalted   
5sing unto the lord for he hath 
done gloriously   
this is made known in all the earth   6cry aloud and shout  thou 
inhabitant of zion   
for great is the holy one of israel 
in the midst of thee   
 
the burden of bab ylon which 
isaiah the son of amoz did 
see  
 
2set ye up an ensign upon the high 
mountain   
lift up the voice unto them   
wave the hand  that they may go  
into the gates of the nobles   
3i have commanded my consecrated 
ones  
yea i have called my mighty o nes 
for mine anger   
even my proudly exulting ones   
4hark  a tumult in the mountains   
like as of a great people   
hark  the uproar of the kingdoms  
of the nations gathered together   
the lord of hosts mustereth  
the host of the battle   
 
5they come from a far country   
from the end of heaven   
even the lord and the weapons of 
his indignation   
to destroy the whole earth   
6howl ye  for the day of the lord is 
at hand   
as destruction from the almighty 
shall it come   
7therefore shall all hands be slack   
and every heart of man shall melt   
8and they shall be affrighted   12 13 isaiah  
581 
 pangs and throes shall take hold of 
them   
they shall be in pain as a woman in 
travail   
they shall look aghast one at 
another   
their faces shall be faces of flame   
 
9behold  the day of the lord 
cometh   
cruel and full of wrath and fierce 
anger   
to make the earth a desolation   
and to destroy the sinners thereof 
out of it   
10for the stars of heaven and the 
constellations thereof  
shall not give their light   
the sun shall be darkened i n his 
going forth   
and the moon shall not cause her 
light to shine   
11and i will visit upon the world 
their evil   
and upon the wicked their iniquity   
and i will cause the arrogancy of 
the proud to cease   
and will lay low the haughtiness of 
the tyrants   
12i will make man more rare than 
fine gold   
even man than the pure gold of 
ophir   
 
13therefore i will make the heavens 
to tremble   
and the earth shall be shaken out of 
her place   
for the wrath of the lord of hosts   and for the day of his fierce ang er  
14and it shall come to pass  that as 
the chased gazelle   
and as sheep that no man gathereth   
they shall turn every man to his 
own people   
and shall flee every man to his own 
land  
15every one that is found shall be 
thrust through   
and every one t hat is caught shall 
fall by the sword   
16their babes also shall be dashed in 
pieces before their eyes   
their houses shall be spoiled   
and their wives ravished   
 
17behold  i will stir up the medes 
against them   
who shall not regard silver   
and as for gold they shall not 
delight in it   
18and their bows shall dash the 
young men in pieces   
and they shall have no pity on the 
fruit of the womb   
their eye shall not spare children   
19and babylon  the glory of 
kingdoms   
the beauty of the chaldeans pride   
shall be as when god overthrew 
sodom and gomorrah   
 
20it shall never be inhabited   
neither shall it be dwelt in from 
generation to generation   
neither shall the arabian pitch tent 
there   isaiah  
582 
 neither shall the shepherds make 
their fold there   
21but wild cats shall lie there   
and their houses shall be full of 
ferrets   
and ostriches shall dwell there   
and satyrs shall dance there   
22and jackals shall howl in their 
castles   
and wild dogs in the pleasant 
palaces   
and her time is near to come   
and her d ays shall not be 
prolonged   
 
for the lord will have 
compassion on jacob  and will 
yet choose israel  and set them in their 
own land  and the stranger shall join 
himself with them  and they shall 
cleave to the house of jacob  2and the 
peoples shall take  them  and bring 
them to their place  and the house of 
israel shall possess them in the land of 
the lord for servants and for 
handmaids  and they shall take them 
captive  whose captives they were  and 
they shall rule over their oppressors   
3and it shall c ome to pass in the day 
that the lord shall give thee rest from 
thy travail  and from thy trouble  and 
from the hard service wherein thou 
wast made to serve  4that thou shalt 
take up this parable against the king of 
babylon  and say   
how hath the oppressor  ceased   
the exactress of gold ceased   
5the lord hath broken the staff of 
the wicked   the sceptre of the rulers   
6that smote the peoples in wrath  
with an incessant stroke   
that ruled the nations in anger   
with a persecution that none 
restrained   
7the whole earth is at rest  and is 
quiet   
they break forth into singing   
8yea the cypresses rejoice at thee   
and the cedars of lebanon   
since thou art laid down   
no feller is come up against us   
 
9the nether world from beneath is 
moved for thee  
to meet thee at thy coming   
the shades are stirred up for thee   
even all the chief ones of the earth   
all the kings of the nations  
are raised up from their thrones   
10all they do answer  
and say unto thee   
art thou also become weak as we   
art thou be come like unto us   
11thy pomp is brought down to the 
nether world   
and the noise of thy psalteries   
the maggot is spread under thee   
and the worms cover thee   
 
12how art thou fallen from heaven   
o day star son of the morning   
how art thou cut down  to the 
ground   
that didst cast lots over the nations   
13and thou saidst in thy heart   
i will ascend into heaven   
above the stars of god  14 isaiah  
583 
 will i exalt my throne   
and i will sit upon the mount of 
meeting   
in the uttermost parts of the north   
14i will ascend above the heights of 
the clouds   
i will be like the most high   
15yet thou shalt be brought down to 
the nether world   
to the uttermost parts of the pit   
 
16they that saw thee do narrowly 
look upon thee   
they gaze earnestly at thee   
is this the man that made the earth 
to tremble   
that did shake kingdoms   
17that made the world as a 
wilderness   
and destroyed the cities thereof   
that opened not the house of his 
prisoners   
18all the kings of the nations   
all of them  sleep in glory   
every one in his own house   
19but thou art cast forth away from 
thy grave  
like an abhorred offshoot   
in the raiment of the slain  that are 
thrust through with the sword   
that go down to the pavement of 
the pit   
as a carcass trodden under foot   
20thou shal t not be joined with them 
in burial   
bbecause thou hast destroyed thy 
land  
thou hast slain thy people   
the seed of evil doers shall not  be named for ever   
21prepare ye slaughter for his 
children  
for the iniquity of their fathers   
that they rise not  up and possess 
the earth   
and fill the face of the world with 
cities   
22and i will rise up against them  
saith the lord of hosts  and cut off 
from babylon name and remnant  and 
offshoot and offspring  saith the lord 
23i will also make it a possession for 
the bittern  and pools of water  and i 
will sweep it with the besom of 
destruction  saith the lord of hosts   
 
24the lord of hosts hath sworn  
saying   
surely as i have thought  so shall it 
come to pass   
and as i have purposed  so shall it 
stand   
25that i will break asshur in my 
land  
and upon my mountains tread him 
under foot   
then shall his yoke depart from off 
them   
and his burden depart from off their 
shoulder   
26this is the purpose that is 
purposed upon the whole earth   
and this is the hand that is stretched 
out upon all the nations   
27for the lord of hosts hath 
purposed   
and who shall disannul it   
and his hand is stretched out   isaiah  
584 
 and who shall turn it back   
 
28in the year that king ahaz died 
was this burden   
 
29rejoice not  o philistia  all of thee   
because the rod that smote thee is 
broken   
for out of the serpent s root shall 
come forth a basilisk   
and his fruit shall be a flying 
serpent   
30and the first born of the poor shall 
feed  
and the needy shall lie down in 
safety   
and i wil l kill thy root with famine   
and thy remnant shall be slain  
31howl  o gate  cry o city   
melt away  o philistia  all of thee   
for there cometh a smoke out of the 
north   
and there is no straggler in his 
ranks   
32what then shall one answer the 
messenger s of the nation   
that the lord hath founded zion   
and in her shall the afflicted of his 
people take refuge   
 
the burden of moab   
 
for in the night that ar of moab is 
laid waste   
he is brought to ruin   
for in the night that kir of moab is 
laid wast e  
he is brought to ruin   2he is gone up to baith  and to 
dibon   
tto the high places  to weep   
upon nebo  and upon medeba  
moab howleth   
on all their heads is baldness   
every beard is shaven   
3in their streets they gird themselves 
with sackcloth   
on their housetops  and in their 
broad places   
every one howleth  weeping 
profusely   
4and heshbon crieth out  and 
elealeh   
their voice is heard even unto 
jahaz   
therefore the armed men of moab 
cry aloud   
his soul is faint within him   
5my heart crieth out for moab   
her fugitives reach unto zoar   
a heifer of three years old   
for by the ascent of luhith  
with weeping they go up   
for in the way of horonaim  
they raise up a cry of destruction   
6for the waters of nimrim shall be 
desolate   
for the grass  is withered away  the 
herbage faileth   
there is no green thing   
7therefore the abundance they have 
gotten   
and that which they have laid up   
shall they carry away to the brook 
of the willows   
8for the cry is gone round about  
the borders of moab   15 isaiah  
585 
 the howling thereof unto eglaim   
and the howling thereof unto beer 
elim  
9for the waters of dimon are full of 
blood   
for i will bring yet more upon 
dimon   
a lion upon him that escapeth of 
moab   
and upon the remnant of the land   
 
send ye the lambs fo r the ruler 
 of the land  
from the crags that are toward the 
wilderness   
unto the mount of the daughter of 
zion   
2for it shall be that  as wandering 
birds   
as a scattered nest   
so shall the daughters of moab be  
at the fords of arnon   
3give counsel  execute justice   
make thy shadow as the night in the 
midst of the noonday   
hide the outcasts  betray not the 
fugitive   
4let mine outcasts dwell with thee   
as for moab  be thou a covert to 
him from the face of the spoiler   
for the extortion is at an e nd 
spoiling ceaseth   
they that trampled down are 
consumed out of the land   
5and a throne is established through 
mercy   
and there sitteth thereon in truth  in 
the tent of david   one that judgeth  and seeketh 
justice  and is ready in 
righteousness   
 
6we have heard of the pride of 
moab   
he is very proud   
even of his haughtiness  and his 
pride  and his arrogancy   
his illfounded boastings   
7therefore shall moab wail for 
moab   
every one shall wail  for the sweet 
cakes of kir hareseth shall ye 
mourn   
sorely stricken   
8for the fields of heshbon languish   
and the vine of sibmah   
whose choice plants did overcome  
the lords of nations   
they reached even unto jazer   
they wandered into the wilderness   
her branches were spread abroad   
they passed over the sea   
9therefore i will weep with the 
weeping of jazer  
for the vine of sibmah   
i will water thee with my tears   
o heshbon  and elealeh   
for upon thy summer fruits and 
upon thy harvest  
the battle shout is fallen   
10and gladness and joy are taken 
away  
out of the fruitful field   
and in the vineyards there shall be 
no singing   
neither shall there be shouting   16 isaiah  
586 
 no treader shall tread out wine in 
the presses   
i have made the vintage shout to 
cease   
11wherefore my heart moaneth like 
a harp for moab   
and mine inward parts for kir 
heres   
12and it shall come to pass  when it 
is seen that moab hath wearied himself 
upon the high place  that he shall come 
to his sanctuary to pray  but he shall 
not prevail  
13this is the word that the lord 
spoke concerning  moab in time past  
14but now the lord hath spoken  
saying  within three years  as the 
years of a hireling  and the glory of 
moab shall wax contemptible for all 
his great multitude  and the remnant 
shall be very small and without 
strength   
 
the burde n of damascus   
 
behold  damascus is taken away 
from being a city   
and it shall be a ruinous heap   
2the cities of aroer are forsaken   
they shall be for flocks   
which shall lie down  and none 
shall make them afraid   
3the fortress also shall cease from 
ephraim   
and the kingdom from damascus   
and the remnant of aram shall be 
as the glory of the children of 
israel   
sith the lord of hosts    
4and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that the glory of jacob shall be 
made thin   
and the fatness of his flesh  shall 
wax lean   
5and it shall be as when the 
harvestman gathereth the standing 
corn  
and reapeth the ears with his arm   
yea it shall be as when one 
gleaneth ears  
in the valley of rephaim   
6yet there shall be left therein 
gleanings   
as at the beatin g of an olive tree  
two or three berries  
in the top of the uppermost bough   
four or five in the branches of the 
fruitful tree   
saith the lord the god of israel   
 
7in that day shall a man regard his 
maker   
and his eyes shall look to the holy 
one of i srael   
8and he shall not regard the altars   
the work of his hands   
neither shall he look to that which 
his fingers have made   
either the asherim  or the sun 
images   
 
9in that day shall his strong cities be 
as the forsaken places  which were 
forsaken f rom before the children of 
israel  after the manner of woods and 17 isaiah  
587 
 lofty forests  and it shall be a 
desolation   
10for thou hast forgotten the god of 
thy salvation   
and thou hast not been mindful of 
the rock of thy stronghold   
therefore thou didst plant pl ants of 
pleasantness   
and didst set it with slips of a 
stranger   
11in the day of thy planting thou 
didst make it to grow   
and in the morning thou didst make 
thy seed to blossom  
a heap of boughs in the day of grief  
and of desperate pain   
 
12ah the up roar of many peoples   
that roar like the roaring of the 
seas  
and the rushing of nations  that rush 
like the rushing of mighty waters   
13the nations shall rush like the 
rushing of many waters   
but he shall rebuke them  and they 
shall flee far off   
and shall be chased as the chaff of 
the mountains before the wind   
and like the whirling dust before 
the storm   
14at eventide behold terror   
and before the morning they are 
not  
this is the portion of them that spoil 
us  
and the lot of them that rob us   
 
ah land of the buzzing of 
 wings   which is beyond the rivers of 
ethiopia   
2that sendeth ambassadors by the 
sea  
even in vessels of papyrus upon the 
waters   
go ye swift messengers   
to a nation tall and of glossy skin   
to a people terrible from their 
beginning onward   
a nation that is sturdy and treadeth 
down   
whose land the rivers divide   
3all ye inhabitants of the world  and 
ye dwellers on the earth   
when an ensign is lifted up on the 
mountains  see ye   
and when the horn is blown  hear 
ye  
 
4for thus hath the lord said unto 
me  
i will hold me still  and i will look 
on in my dwelling place   
like clear heat in sunshine   
like a cloud of dew in the heat of 
harvest   
5for before the harvest  when the 
blossom is over   
and the bud becometh a ripening 
grape   
he will cut off the sprigs with 
pruning hooks   
and the shoots will he take away 
and lop off   
6they shall be left together unto the 
ravenous birds of the mountains   
and to the beasts of the earth   18 isaiah  
588 
 and the ravenous birds shall 
summer upo n them   
and all the beasts of the earth shall 
winter upon them   
7in that time shall a present be 
brought unto the lord of hosts of 
a people tall and of glossy skin  
and from a people terrible from 
their beginning onward  a nation 
that is sturdy and tread eth down  
whose land the rivers divide  to 
the place of the name of the lord 
of hosts  the mount zion   
 
the burden of egypt   
 
behold  the lord rideth upon a swift 
cloud   
and cometh unto egypt   
and the idols of egypt shall be 
moved at his presence   
and the heart of egypt shall melt 
within it   
2and i will spur egypt against 
egypt   
and they shall fight every one 
against his brother   
and everyone against his neighbour   
city against city  and kingdom 
against kingdom   
3and the spirit of egypt shall b e 
made empty within it   
and i will make void the counsel 
thereof   
and they shall seek unto the idols  
and to the whisperers   
and to the ghosts  and to the 
familiar spirits   
4and i will give over the egyptians  iinto the hand of a cruel lord   
and a fie rce king shall rule over 
them   
saith the lord  the lord of hosts   
 
5and the waters shall fail from the 
sea  
and the river shall be drained dry   
6and the rivers shall become foul   
the streams of egypt shall be 
minished and dried up   
the reeds and flag s shall wither   
7the mosses by the nile  by the 
brink of the nile   
and all that is sown by the nile   
shall become dry  be driven away  
and be no more   
8the fishers also shall lament   
and all they that cast angle into the 
nile shall mourn   
and they th at spread nets upon the 
waters shall languish   
9moreover they that work in 
combed flax   
and they that weave cotton  shall 
be ashamed   
10and her foundations shall be 
crushed   
all they that make dams shall be 
grieved in soul   
 
11the princes of zoan are utter 
fools   
the wisest counsellors of pharaoh 
are a senseless counsel   
how can ye say unto pharaoh  i 
am the son of the wise   
the son of ancient kings   19 isaiah  
589 
 12where are they  then thy wise 
men  
and let them tell thee now   
and let them know what the lord 
of hosts  
hath purposed concerning egypt   
13the princes of zoan are become 
fools   
the princes of noph are deceived   
they have caused egypt to go 
astray   
that are the corner stone of her 
tribes   
14the lord hath mingled within 
her  
a spirit of dizzin ess  
and they have caused egypt to 
stagger in every work thereof   
as a drunken man staggereth in his 
vomit   
15neither shall there be for egypt 
any work   
which head or tail  palm branch or 
rush may do   
16in that day shall egypt be like unto 
women  and it shall tremble and fear 
because of the shaking of the hand of 
the lord of hosts  which he shaketh 
over it  17and the land of judah shall 
become a terror unto egypt  
whensoever one maketh mention 
thereof to it  it shall be afraid  because 
of the purpose of the lord of hosts  
which he purposeth against it   
18in that day there shall be five cities 
in the land of egypt that speak the 
language of canaan  and swear to the 
lord of hosts  one shall be called the 
city of destruction  19in that day shall there be  an altar to the lord in the 
midst of the land of egypt  and a pillar 
at the border thereof to the lord 
20and it shall be for a sign and for a 
witness unto the lord of hosts in the 
land of egypt  for they shall cry unto 
the lord because of the oppressors  
and he will send them a saviour  and a 
defender  who will deliver them  21and 
the lord shall make himself known to 
egypt  and the egyptians shall know 
the lord in that day  yea they shall 
worship with sacrifice and offering  
and shall vow a vow unto the lord 
and shall perform it   
22and the lord will smite egypt  
smiting and healing  and they shall 
return unto the lord and he will be 
entreated of them  and will heal them  
23in that day shall there be a highway 
out of egypt to assyria  and the 
assyrian s hall come into egypt  and 
the egyptian into assyria  and the 
egyptians shall worship with the 
assyrians   
24in that day shall israel be the third 
with egypt and with assyria  a 
blessing in the midst of the earth  25for 
that the lord of hosts hath blessed 
him saying  blessed be egypt my 
people and assyria the work of my 
hands  and israel mine inheritance   
 
in the year that tartan came 
into ashdod  when sargon the 
king of assyria sent him  and he 
fought against ashdod and took it  2at 
that time the lord spoke by isaiah the 
son of amoz  saying  go and loose 20 isaiah  
590 
 the sackcloth from off thy loins  and 
put thy shoe from off thy foot  and he 
did so  walking naked and barefoot   
3and the lord said like as my 
servant isaiah hath walked naked and 
barefoot to be  for three years a sign 
and a wonder upon egypt and upon 
ethiopia  4so shall the king of assyria 
lead away the captives of egypt  and 
the exiles of ethiopia  young and old  
naked and barefoot  and with buttocks 
uncovered  to the shame of egypt  
5and they s hall be dismayed and 
ashamed  because of ethiopia their 
expectation  and of egypt their glory  
6and the inhabitant of this coast land 
shall say in that day  behold  such is 
our expectation  whither we fled for 
help to be delivered from the king of 
assyria  and how shall we escape   
 
the burden of the wilderness 
of the sea   
 
as whirlwinds in the south 
sweeping on   
it cometh from the wilderness  from 
a dreadful land   
2a grievous vision is declared unto 
me  
the treacherous dealer dealeth 
treacherously  and the spoiler 
spoileth   
go up  o elam  besiege  o media   
all the sighing thereof have i made 
to cease   
3therefore are my loins filled with 
convulsion   pangs have taken hold upon me  as 
the pangs of a woman in travail   
i am bent so that i cannot h ear  
i am affrighted so that i cannot see   
4my heart is bewildered  terror hath 
overwhelmed me   
the twilight that i longed for hath 
been turned for me into 
trembling   
5they prepare the table  they light 
the lamps  they eat  they drink  
rise up  ye pri nces anoint the 
shield   
 
6for thus hath the lord said unto 
me  
go set a watchman  let him declare 
what he seeth   
7and when he seeth a troop  
horsemen by pairs   
a troop of asses  a troop of camels   
he shall hearken diligently with 
much heed   
8and h e cried as a lion  upon the 
watch tower  o lord   
i stand continually in the daytime   
and i am set in my ward all the 
nights   
9and behold  there came a troop of 
men horsemen by pairs   
and he spoke and said   
fallen  fallen is babylon   
and all the graven images of her 
gods are broken unto the ground   
10o thou my threshing  and the 
winnowing of my floor   
that which i have heard from the 
lord of hosts   21 isaiah  
591 
 the god of israel  have i declared 
unto you   
 
11the burden of dumah   
 
one calleth unto me out of seir   
watchman  what of the night   
watchman  what of the night   
12the watchman said   
the morning cometh  and also the 
night  
if ye will inquire  inquire ye  return  
come   
 
13the burden upon arabia   
 
in the thickets in arabia shall ye 
lodge  o ye caravans of 
dedanites   
14unto him that is thirsty bring ye 
water   
the inhabitants of the land of tema 
did meet the fugitive with his 
bread   
15for they fled away from the 
swords  from the drawn sword   
and from the bent bow  and from 
the grievousness of war   
16for thus hath the lord said unto me  
within a year  according to the years 
of a hireling  and all the glory of kedar 
shall fail  17and the residue of the 
number of the archers  the mighty men 
of the children of kedar  shall be 
diminished  for the lord the god of 
israel  hath spoken it   
 
the burden concerning the 
valley of vision    
what aileth thee now  that thou art 
wholly gone up to the housetops   
2thou that art full of uproar  a 
tumultuous city  a joyous town   
thy slain are not slain with the 
sword  nor dead in battle   
3all thy rulers are fled together   
without the bow they are bound   
all that are found of thee are bound 
together  they are fled afar off   
4therefore said i  look away from 
me i will weep bitterly   
strain not to co mfort me  for the 
destruction of the daughter of my 
people   
5for it is a day of trouble  and of 
trampling  and of perplexity   
from the lord  the g od of hosts  in 
the valley of vision   
kir shouting  and shoa at the mount   
6and elam bore the quiver  with 
troops of men  even horsemen   
and kir uncovered the shield   
7and it came to pass  when thy 
choicest valleys were full of 
chariots   
and the horsemen set themselves in 
array at the gate   
8and the covering of judah was laid 
bare  
that thou didst look i n that day to the 
armour in the house of the forest  9and 
ye saw the breaches of the city of 
david  that they were many  and ye 
gathered together the waters of the 
lower pool  10and ye numbered the 
houses of jerusalem  and ye broke 
down the houses to forti fy the wall  22 isaiah  
592 
 11ye made also a basin between the 
two walls for the water of the old 
pool 
but ye looked not unto him that had 
done this   
neither had ye respect unto him 
that fashioned it long ago   
12and in that day did the lord  the 
god of hosts  call  
to weeping  and to lamentation  and 
to baldness  and to girding with 
sackcloth   
13and behold joy and gladness   
slaying oxen and killing sheep   
eating flesh and drinking wine  
let us eat and drink  for tomorrow 
we shall die    
14and the lord of hosts rev ealed 
himself in mine ears   
surely this iniquity shall not be 
expiated by you till ye die   
saith the lord  the g od of hosts   
 
15thus saith the lord  the g od of 
hosts   
go get thee unto this steward   
even unto shebna  who is over the 
house   
16what has t thou here  and whom 
hast thou here   
that thou hast hewed thee out here a 
sepulchre   
thou that hewest thee out a 
sepulchre on high   
and gravest a habitation for thyself 
in the rock   
17behold  the lord will hurl thee up 
and down with a man s throw   yea he will wind thee round and 
round   
18he will violently roll and toss 
thee like a ball into a large 
country   
there shalt thou die  and there shall 
be the chariots of thy glory   
thou shame of the lord s house   
19and i will thrust thee from thy 
post  
and from thy station shalt thou be 
pulled down   
20and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that i will call my servant eliakim 
the son of hilkiah   
21and i will clothe him with thy 
robe  
and bind him with thy girdle   
and i will commit thy government 
into his hand   
and he shall be a father to the 
inhabitants of jerusalem  and to 
the house of judah   
22and the key of the house of 
david will i lay upon his 
shoulder   
and he shall open  and none shall 
shut  
and he shall shut  and none shall 
open   
23and i w ill fasten him as a peg in 
a sure place   
and he shall be for a throne of 
honour to his father s house   
24and they shall hang upon him all the 
glory of his father s house  the 
offspring and the issue  all vessels of 
small quantity  from the vessels of isaiah  
593 
 cups even to all the vessels of flagons  
25in that day  saith the lord of hosts  
shall the peg that was fastened in a 
sure place give way  and it shall be 
hewn down  and fall  and the burden 
that was upon it shall be cut off  for 
the lord hath spoken it   
 
the burden of tyre   
 
howl  ye ships of tarshish   
for it is laid waste  so that there is 
no house  no entering in   
from the land of kittim it is 
revealed to them   
2be still  ye inhabitants of the coast 
land  
thou whom the merchants of zidon  
that pass  over the sea  have 
replenished   
3and on great waters the seed of 
shihor   
the harvest of the nile  was her 
revenue   
and she was the mart of nations   
4be thou ashamed  o zidon  for the 
sea hath spoken   
the stronghold of the sea  saying   
i have not tr availed  nor brought 
forth   
neither have i reared young men  
nor brought up virgins   
5when the report cometh to egypt   
they shall be sorely pained at the 
report of tyre   
 
6pass ye over to tarshish  howl  ye 
inhabitants of the coast land  
7is this you r joyous city   whose feet in antiquity   
in ancient days   
carried her afar off to sojourn   
8who hath devised this against tyre  
the crowning city   
whose merchants are princes   
whose traffickers are the 
honourable of the earth   
9the lord of hosts hath  devised it   
to pollute the pride of all glory   
to bring into contempt all the 
honourable of the earth   
10overflow thy land as the nile   
o daughter of tarshish  there is no 
girdle any more   
11he hath stretched out his hand 
over the sea   
he hath shake n the kingdoms   
the lord hath given commandment 
concerning canaan   
to destroy the strongholds thereof   
12and he said  thou shalt no more 
rejoice   
o thou oppressed virgin daughter of 
zidon   
arise pass over to kittim   
even there shalt thou have no r est  
13behold  the land of the 
chaldeans this is the people that was 
not when asshur founded it for 
shipmen they set up their towers  
they overthrew the palaces thereof  it 
is made a ruin   
14howl  ye ships of tarshish   
for your stronghold is laid waste   
 
15and it shall come to pass in that 
day that tyre shall be forgotten 
seventy years  according to the days of 23 isaiah  
594 
 one king  after the end of seventy 
years it shall fare with tyre as in the 
song of the harlot   
16take a harp   
go about the city   
thou harlo t long forgotten   
make sweet melody   
sing many songs   
that thou mayest be remembered   
17and it shall come to pass after the 
end of seventy years  that the lord 
will remember tyre  and she shall 
return to her hire  and shall have 
commerce with all the k ingdoms of the 
world upon the face of the earth  18and 
her gain and her hire shall be holiness 
to the lord it shall not be treasured 
nor laid up  for her gain shall be for 
them that dwell before the lord to eat 
their fill  and for stately clothing   
 
behold  the lord maketh the 
 earth empty and maketh it  
  waste   
and turneth it upside down  and 
scattereth abroad the inhabitants 
thereof   
2and it shall be  as with the people  
so with the priest   
as with the servant  so with his 
master   
as with the m aid so with her 
mistress   
as with the buyer  so with the seller   
as with the lender  so with the 
borrower   
as with the creditor  so with the 
debtor   3the earth shall be utterly emptied  
and clean despoiled   
for the lord hath spoken this word   
4the e arth fainteth and fadeth away   
the world faileth and fadeth away   
the lofty people of the earth do fail   
5the earth also is defiled under the 
inhabitants thereof   
because they have transgressed the 
laws violated the statute   
broken the everlasting co venant   
6therefore hath a curse devoured 
the earth   
and they that dwell therein are 
found guilty   
therefore the inhabitants of the 
earth waste away   
and men are left few   
7the new wine faileth  the vine 
fadeth   
all the merry hearted do sigh   
8the mi rth of tabrets ceaseth   
the noise of them that rejoice 
endeth   
the joy of the harp ceaseth   
9they drink not wine with a song   
strong drink is bitter to them that 
drink it   
10broken down is the city of 
wasteness   
every house is shut up  that none 
may come in   
11there is a crying in the streets 
amidst the wine   
all joy is darkened   
the mirth of the land is gone   
12in the city is left desolation   
and the gate is smitten unto ruin   24 isaiah  
595 
 13for thus shall it be in the midst of 
the earth  among the peoples   
as at the beating of an olive tree  
as at the gleanings when the vintage 
is done   
14those yonder lift up their voice  
they sing for joy   
for the majesty of the lord they 
shout from the sea   
15therefore glorify ye the lord in 
the regions of light   
even the name of the lord the god 
of israel  in the isles of the sea   
 
16from the uttermost part of the 
earth have we heard songs  glory 
to the righteous   
but i say  i waste away  i waste 
away  woe is me   
the treacherous deal treacherously   
yea the treacherous deal very 
treacherously   
17terror  and the pit  and the trap  
are upon thee  o inhabitant of the 
earth   
18and it shall come to pass  that he 
who fleeth from the noise of the 
terror shall fall into the pit   
and he that cometh up out of the 
midst of the pit shall be taken in 
the trap   
for the windows on high are 
opened   
and the foundations of the earth do 
shake   
19the earth is broken  broken down   
the earth is crumbled in pieces   
the earth trembleth and tottereth   20the earth reeleth to and fro like a 
drunken man   
and swayeth to and fro as a lodge   
and the transgression thereof is 
heavy upon it   
and it shall fall  and not rise again   
21and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that the lord will punish the host 
of the high heaven on hig h  
and the kings of the earth upon the 
earth   
22and they shall be gathered 
together  as prisoners are gathered 
in the dungeon   
and shall be shut up in the prison   
and after many days shall they be 
punished   
23then the moon shall be 
confounded  and the  sun 
ashamed   
for the lord of hosts will reign in 
mount zion   
and in jerusalem  and before his 
elders shall be glory   
 
o lord thou art my god   
i will exalt thee  i will praise 
  thy name   
for thou hast done wonderful 
things   
even counsels of old  in faithfulness 
and truth   
2for thou hast made of a city a 
heap   
of a fortified city a ruin   
a castle of strangers to be no city   
it shall never be built   25 isaiah  
596 
 3therefore shall the strong people 
glorify thee   
the city of the terrible nations shall 
fear t hee  
4for thou hast been a stronghold to 
the poor   
a stronghold to the needy in his 
distress   
a refuge from the storm  a shadow 
from the heat   
for the blast of the terrible ones was 
as a storm against the wall   
5as the heat in a dry place  thou 
didst subdue the noise of 
strangers   
as the heat by the shadow of a 
cloud  the song of the terrible 
ones was brought low   
 
6and in this mountain will the lord 
of hosts make unto all peoples  
a feast of fat things  a feast of wines 
on the lees   
of fat things f ull of marrow  of 
wines on the lees well refined   
7and he will destroy in this 
mountain  
the face of the covering that is cast 
over all peoples   
and the veil that is spread over all 
nations   
8he will swallow up death for ever   
and the lord g od will wip e away 
tears from off all faces   
and the reproach of his people will 
he take away from off all the 
earth   
for the lord hath spoken it   
 9and it shall be said in that day   
lo this is our god   
for whom we waited  that he might 
save us   
this is the lord for whom we 
waited   
we will be glad and rejoice in his 
salvation   
10for in this mountain will the hand 
of the lord rest  
and moab shall be trodden down in 
his place   
even as straw is trodden down in 
the dunghill   
11and when he shall spread forth his 
hands in the midst thereof   
as he that swimmeth spreadeth 
forth his hands to swim   
his pride shall be brought down 
together with the cunning of his 
hands   
12and the high fortress of thy walls 
will he bring down  lay low   
and bring to the ground  even to the 
dust  
 
in that day shall this song be 
sung in the land of judah   
we have a strong city   
walls and bulwarks doth he appoint 
for salvation   
2open ye the gates   
that the righteous nation that 
keepeth faithfulness may enter in   
3the mind sta yed on thee thou 
keepest in perfect peace   
because it trusteth in thee   
4trust ye in the lord for ever   26 isaiah  
597 
 for the lord is g od an everlasting 
rock   
5for he hath brought down them 
that dwell on high   
the lofty city  laying it low  laying 
it low even to t he ground   
bringing it even to the dust   
6the foot shall tread it down   
even the feet of the poor  and the 
steps of the needy   
 
7the way of the just is straight   
thou  most upright  makest plain 
the path of the just   
8yea in the way of thy judgments   
o lord have we waited for thee   
to thy name and to thy memorial 
is the desire of our soul   
9with my soul have i desired thee 
in the night   
yea with my spirit within me have i 
sought thee earnestly   
for when thy judgments are in the 
earth   
the inh abitants of the world learn 
righteousness   
10let favour be shown to the 
wicked  yet will he not learn 
righteousness   
in the land of uprightness will he 
deal wrongfully   
and will not behold the majesty of 
the lord  
 
11lord thy hand was lifted up  yet 
they see not   
they shall see with shame thy zeal 
for the people   yea fire shall devour thine 
adversaries   
12lord thou wilt establish peace 
for us   
for thou hast indeed wrought all 
our works for us   
13o lord our god  other lords 
beside thee have had d ominion 
over us   
but by thee only do we make 
mention of thy name   
14the dead live not  the shades rise 
not  
to that end hast thou punished and 
destroyed them   
and made all their memory to 
perish   
15thou hast gotten thee honour with 
the nations  o lord  
yea exceeding great honour with 
the nations   
thou art honoured unto the farthest 
ends of the earth   
 
16lord in trouble have they sought 
thee   
silently they poured out a prayer 
when thy chastening was upon 
them   
17like as a woman with child  that 
draweth near the time of her 
delivery   
is in pain and crieth out in her 
pangs   
so have we been at thy presence  o 
lord  
18we have been with child  we have 
been in pain   isaiah  
598 
 we have as it were brought forth 
wind   
we have not wrought any 
deliverance in the l and  
neither are the inhabitants of the 
world come to life   
19thy dead shall live  my dead 
bodies shall arise  
awake and sing  ye that dwell in the 
dust 
for thy dew is as the dew of light   
and the earth shall bring to life the 
shades   
 
20come  my peop le enter thou into 
thy chambers   
and shut thy doors about thee   
hide thyself for a little moment   
until the indignation be overpast   
21for behold  the lord cometh forth 
out of his place  
to visit upon the inhabitants of the 
earth their iniquity   
the earth also shall disclose her 
blood   
and shall no more cover her slain   
in that day the lord with his 
sore and great and strong 
sword will punish leviathan the slant 
serpent  and leviathan the tortuous 
serpent  and he will slay the dragon 
that is in the sea   
2in that day sing ye of her   
a vineyard of foaming wine    
3i the lord do guard it   
i water it every moment   
lest mine anger visit it   
i guard it night and day   
4fury is not in me   would that i were as the briers and 
thorns in flame   
i would with one step burn it 
altogether   
5or else let him take hold of my 
strength   
that he may make peace with me  
yea let him make peace with me   
6in days to come shall jacob take 
root  
israel shall blossom and bud   
and the face of the world shall be  
filled with fruitage   
 
7hath he smitten him as he smote 
those that smote him   
or is he slain according to the 
slaughter of them that were slain 
by him   
8in full measure  when thou sendest 
her away  thou dost contend with 
her  
he hath removed her with his rough 
blast in the day of the east wind   
9therefore by this shall the iniquity 
of jacob be expiated   
and this is all the fruit of taking 
away his sin   
when he maketh all the stones of 
the altar as chalkstones that are 
beaten in pieces   
so that the asherim and the sun 
images shall rise no more   
10for the fortified city is solitary   
a habitation abandoned and 
forsaken  like the wilderness   
there shall the calf feed  and there 
shall he lie down   
and consume the branches thereof  27 isaiah  
599 
 11when the boughs th ereof are 
withered   
they shall be broken off   
the women shall come  and set 
them on fire   
for it is a people of no 
understanding   
therefore he that made them will 
not have compassion upon them   
and he that formed them will not 
be gracious unto them   
 
12and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that the lord will beat off his 
fruit  
from the flood of the river unto the 
brook of egypt   
and ye shall be gathered one by 
one o ye children of israel   
 
13and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that a great  horn shall be blown   
and they shall come that were lost 
in the land of assyria   
and they that were dispersed in the 
land of egypt   
and they shall worship the lord in 
the holy mountain at jerusalem   
 
woe to the crown of pride of 
 the  drunkards of e phraim   
and to the fading flower of his 
glorious beauty   
which is on the head of the fat 
valley of them that are smitten 
down with wine   2behold  the lord hath a mighty and 
strong one   
as a storm of hail  a tempest of 
destruction   
as a storm of mighty  waters 
overflowing   
that casteth down to the earth with 
violence   
3the crown of pride of the 
drunkards of ephraim  
shall be trodden under foot   
4and the fading flower of his 
glorious beauty   
which is on the head of the fat 
valley   
shall be as the fir stripe fig before 
the summer   
which when one looketh upon it   
while it is yet in his hand he eateth 
it up  
 
5in that day shall the lord of hosts 
be  
for a crown of glory  and for a 
diadem of beauty   
unto the residue of his people   
6and for a spirit o f judgment to him 
that sitteth in judgment   
and for strength to them that turn 
back the battle at the gate   
 
7but these also reel through wine   
and stagger through strong drink   
the priest and the prophet reel 
through strong drink   
they are confused b ecause of wine   
they stagger because of strong 
drink   28 isaiah  
600 
 they reel in vision  they totter in 
judgment   
8for all tables are full of filthy 
vomit  and no place is clean   
 
9whom shall one teach knowledge   
and whom shall one make to 
understand the message   
them that are weaned from the 
milk  
them that are drawn from the 
breasts   
10for it is precept by precept  
precept by precept   
line by line  line by line   
here a little  there a little   
11for with stammering lips and with 
a strange tongue  
shall it be spoken to this people   
12to whom it was said  this is the 
rest  
give ye rest to the weary   
and this is the refreshing   
yet they would not hear   
13and so the word of the lord is 
unto them  
precept by precept  precept by

here a little  there a little   
that they may go  and fall 
backward  and be broken   
and snared  and taken   
 
14wherefore hear the word of the 
lord ye scoffers   
the ballad mongers of this people 
which is in jerusalem   15because ye have said  we have 
made a covenant with death   
and with the nether world are we at 
agreement   
when the scouring scourge shall 
pass through   
it shall not come unto us   
for we have made lies our refuge   
and in falsehood have we hid 
ourselves   
16therefore thus sai th the lord g od  
behold  i lay in zion for a 
foundation a stone   
a tried stone  a costly corner stone 
of sure foundation   
he that believeth shall not make 
haste   
17and i will make justice the line   
and righteousness the plummet   
and the hail shall sw eep away the 
refuge of lies   
and the waters shall overflow the 
hiding place   
18and your covenant with death 
shall be disannulled  
and your agreement with the 
nether world shall not stand   
when the scouring scourge shall 
pass through   
then ye shall be t rodden down by it   
19as often as it passeth through  it 
shall take you   
for morning by morning shall it 
pass through   
by day and by night   
and it shall be sheer terror to 
understand the message   
20for the bed is too short for a man 
to stretch himself   isaiah  
601 
 and the covering too narrow when 
he gathereth himself up   
21for the lord will rise up as in 
mount perazim   
he will be wroth as in the valley of 
gibeon   
that he may do his work  strange is 
his work   
and bring to pass his act  strange is 
his act   
22now therefore be ye not scoffers   
lest your bands be made strong   
for an extermination wholly 
determined have i heard from the 
lord  the g od of hosts   
upon the whole land   
 
23give ye ear  and hear my voice  
attend  and hear my speech   
24is the plowman n ever done with 
plowing to sow   
with the opening and harrowing of 
his ground   
25when he hath made plain the face 
thereof   
doth he not cast abroad the black 
cummin  and scatter the cummin   
and put in the wheat in rows and 
the barley in the appointed plac e  
and the spelt in the border thereof   
26for he doth instruct him aright   
his god doth teach him   
27for the black cummin is not 
threshed with a threshing sledge   
neither is a cart wheel turned about 
upon the cummin   
but the black cummin is beaten out  
with a staff  
and the cummin with a rod   28is bread corn crushed   
nay he will not ever be threshing it   
and though the roller of his wagon 
and its sharp edges move noisily   
he doth not crush it   
29this also cometh forth from the 
lord of hosts   
wond erful is his counsel  and great 
his wisdom   
 
ah aariel  ariel  the city 
 where  david encamped   
add ye year to year   
let the feasts come round   
2then will i distress ariel   
and there shall be mourning and 
moaning  and she shall be unto 
me as a hea rth of god   
3and i will encamp against thee 
round about   
and will lay siege against thee with 
a mound   
and i will raise siege works against 
thee  
4and brought down thou shalt 
speak out of the ground   
and thy speech shall be low out of 
the dust   
and thy voice shall be as of a ghost 
out of the ground   
and thy speech shall chirp out of 
the dust   
5but the multitude of thy foes shall 
be like small dust   
and the multitude of the terrible 
ones as chaff that passeth away   
                                                      
a that is the hearth of god  29 isaiah  
602 
 yea it shall be at an instant 
suddenly   
6there shall be a visitation from the 
lord of hosts  
with thunder  and with earthquake  
and great noise   
with whirlwind and tempest  and 
the flame of a devouring fire   
7and the multitude of all the 
nations that war against ariel   
even all that war against her  and 
the bulwarks about her  and they 
that distress her   
shall be as a dream  a vision of the 
night   
8and it shall be as when a hungry 
man dreameth  and behold  he 
eateth   
but he awaketh  and his soul is 
empty   
or as when a thirsty man  dreameth  
and behold  he drinketh   
but he awaketh  and behold  he is 
faint and his soul hath 
appetite  
so shall the multitude of all the 
nations be  that fight against 
mount zion   
 
9stupefy yourselves  and be stupid   
blind yourselves  and be blind   
ye that are drunken  but not with 
wine   
that stagger  but not with strong 
drink   
10for the lord hath poured out 
upon you the spirit of deep 
sleep   
and hath closed your eyes   the prophets  and your heads  the 
seers  hath he covered   
11and the vision o f all this is 
become unto you as the words of a 
writing that is sealed  which men 
deliver to one that is learned  saying  
read this  i pray thee  and he saith  i 
cannot  for it is sealed  12and the 
writing is delivered to him that is not 
learned  sayin g read this  i pray 
thee and he saith  i am not learned   
 
13and the lord said  forasmuch as 
this people draw near   
and with their mouth and with 
their lips do honour me   
but have removed their heart far 
from me   
and their fear of me is a 
command ment of men learned 
by rote   
14therefore  behold  i will again do 
a marvellous work among this 
people   
even a marvellous work and a 
wonder   
and the wisdom of their wise men 
shall perish   
and the prudence of their prudent 
men shall be hid   
 
15woe unto them that seek deep to 
hide their counsel from the 
lord  
and their works are in the dark   
and they say  who seeth us  and 
who knoweth us   
16o your perversity   isaiah  
603 
 shall the potter be esteemed as 
clay  
that the thing made should say of 
him that made it  he made me 
not  
or the thing framed say of him that 
framed it  he hath no 
understanding   
17is it not yet a very little while   
and lebanon shall be turned into a 
fruitful field   
and the fruitful field shall be 
esteemed as a forest   
18and in that da y shall the deaf hear 
the words of a book   
and the eyes of the blind shall see 
out of obscurity and out of 
darkness   
19the humble also shall increase 
their joy in the lord  
and the neediest among men shall 
exult in the holy one of israel   
20for the ter rible one is brought to 
nought   
and the scorner ceaseth   
and all they that watch for iniquity 
are cut off   
21that make a man an offender by 
words   
and lay a snare for him that 
reproveth in the gate   
and turn aside the just with a thing 
of nought   
22therefore thus saith the lord who 
redeemed abraham  concerning the 
house of jacob   
jacob shall not now be ashamed   
neither shall his face now wax 
pale  23when he seeth his children  the 
work of my hands  in the midst 
of him   
that they sanctify my name   
yea they shall sanctify the holy 
one of jacob   
and shall stand in awe of the god 
of israel   
24they also that err in spirit shall 
come to understanding   
and they that murmur shall learn 
instruction   
 
woe to the rebellious children  
 saith the lord  
that take counsel  but not of me   
and that form projects  but not of 
my spirit   
that they may add sin to sin   
2that walk to go down into egypt   
and have not asked at my mouth   
to take refuge in the stronghold of 
pharaoh   
and to take shelter in the  shadow 
of egypt   
3therefore shall the stronghold of 
pharaoh turn to your shame   
and the shelter in the shadow of 
egypt to your confusion   
4for his princes are at zoan   
and his ambassadors are come to 
hanes   
5they shall all be ashamed of a 
people that  cannot profit them   
that are not a help nor profit   
but a shame  and also a reproach   
 
6the burden of the beasts of the 
south   30 isaiah  
604 
  
through the land of trouble and 
anguish   
from whence come the lioness and 
the lion   
the viper and flying serpent   
they c arry their riches upon the 
shoulders of young asses   
and their treasures upon the humps 
of camels   
to a people that shall not profit 
them   
7for egypt helpeth in vain  and to 
no purpose   
therefore have i called her 
arrogancy that sitteth still   
8now go  write it before them on a 
tablet   
and inscribe it in a book   
that it may be for the time to come  
for ever and ever   
9for it is a rebellious people   
lying children   
children that refuse to hear the 
teaching of the lord  
10that say to the seers  see not   
and to the prophets  prophesy not 
unto us right things   
speak unto us smooth things  
prophesy delusions   
11get you out of the way   
turn aside out of the path   
cause the holy one of israel  
to cease from before us   
12wherefore thus saith the  holy 
one of israel   
because ye despise this word   
and trust in oppression and 
perverseness   and stay thereon   
13therefore this iniquity shall be to 
you  
as a breach ready to fall  swelling 
out in a high wall   
whose breaking cometh suddenly 
at an inst ant  
14and he shall break it as a potter s 
vessel is broken   
breaking it in pieces without 
sparing   
so that there shall not be found 
among the pieces thereof a 
sherd  
to take fire from the hearth   
or to take water out of the cistern   
 
15for thus said the lord g od the 
holy one of israel   
in sitting still and rest shall ye be 
saved   
in quietness and in confidence shall 
be your strength   
and ye would not   
16but ye said  no for we will flee 
upon horses   
therefore shall ye flee   
and we will ride  upon the swift   
therefore shall they that pursue 
you be swift   
17one thousand shall flee at the 
rebuke of one   
at the rebuke of five shall ye flee   
till ye be left as a beacon upon the 
top of a mountain   
and as an ensign on a hill   
18and therefore will the lord wait 
that he may be gracious unto 
you  isaiah  
605 
 and therefore will he be exalted  
that he may have compassion 
upon  you  
for the lord is a god of justice   
happy are all they that wait for 
him  
 
19for o people that dwellest in 
zion at jerusalem   
thou shalt weep no more   
he will surely be gracious unto 
thee at the voice of thy cry   
when he shall hear  he will 
answer thee   
20and though the lord give you 
sparing bread and scant water   
yet shall not thy teacher hide 
himself any more   
but thine ey es shall see thy 
teacher   
21and thine ears shall hear a word 
behind thee  saying   
this is the way  walk ye in it   
when ye turn to the right hand  and 
when ye turn to the left   
22and ye shall defile thy graven 
images overlaid with silver   
and thy mol ten images covered 
with gold   
thou shalt put them far away as 
one unclean   
thou shalt say unto it  get thee 
hence   
23and he will give the rain for thy 
seed wherewith thou sowest the 
ground   
and bread of the increase of the 
ground  and it shall be fa t and 
plenteous   in that day shall thy cattle feed in 
large pastures   
24the oxen likewise and the young 
asses that till the ground  
shall eat savoury provender   
wwhich hath been winnowed with 
the shovel and with the fan   
25and there shall be upon every  
lofty mountain  and upon every 
high hill  
streams and watercourses   
in the day of the great slaughter  
when the towers fall   
26moreover the light of the moon 
shall be as the light of the sun   
and the light of the sun shall be 
sevenfold  as the light of  the 
seven days   
in the day that the lord bindeth up 
the bruise of his people   
and healeth the stroke of their 
wound   
 
27behold  the name of the lord 
cometh from far   
with his anger burning  and in 
thick uplifting of smoke   
his lips are full of indign ation   
and his tongue is as a devouring 
fire  
28and his breath is as an 
overflowing stream   
that divideth even unto the neck   
to sift the nations with the sieve of 
destruction   
and a bridle that causeth to err 
shall be in the jaws of the 
peoples   
29ye shall have a song  isaiah  
606 
 as in the night when a feast is 
hallowed   
and gladness of heart  as when one 
goeth with the pipe  
to come into the mountain of the 
lord to the rock of israel   
30and the lord will cause his 
glorious voice to be heard   
and will show the lighting down of 
his arm   
with furious anger  and the flame 
of a devouring fire   
with a bursting of clouds  and a 
storm of rain  and hailstones   
31for through the voice of the lord 
shall asshur be dismayed   
the rod with which he smote   
32and in ev ery place where the 
appointed staff shall pass   
which the lord shall lay upon him   
it shall be with tabrets and harps   
and in battles of wielding will he 
fight with them   
33for a hearth is ordered of old   
yea for the king it is prepared   
deep and la rge  
the pile thereof is fire and much 
wood   
the breath of the lord like a 
stream of brimstone  doth kindle 
it  
 
woe to them that go down to 
 egypt for help   
and rely on horses   
and trust in chariots  because they 
are many   
and in horsemen  becau se they are 
exceeding mighty   but they look not unto the holy one 
of israel   
neither seek the lord  
2yet he also is wise   
and bringeth evil   
and doth not call back his words   
but will arise against the house of 
the evil doers   
and against the help o f them that 
work iniquity   
3now the egyptians are men  and 
not god   
and their horses flesh  and not 
spirit   
so when the lord shall stretch out 
his hand   
both he that helpeth shall stumble  
and he that is helped shall fall   
and they all shall perish to gether   
 
4for thus saith the lord unto me   
like as the lion  or the young lion  
growling over his prey   
though a multitude of shepherds be 
called forth against him   
will not be dismayed at their voice   
nor abase himself for the noise of 
them   
so will  the lord of hosts come 
down  
to fight upon mount zion  and upon 
the hill thereof   
5as birds hovering   
so will the lord of hosts protect 
jerusalem   
he will deliver it as he protecteth it   
he will rescue it as he passeth over   
6turn ye unto him  31 isaiah  
607 
 agains t whom ye have deeply 
rebelled  o children of israel   
7for in that day they shall cast away 
every man his idols of silver  and 
his idols of gold   
which your own hands have made 
unto you for a sin   
8then shall asshur fall with the 
sword  not of man   
and the sword  not of men  shall 
devour him   
and he shall flee from the sword   
and his young men shall become 
tributary   
9and his rock shall pass away by 
reason of terror   
and his princes shall be dismayed at 
the ensign   
saith the lord whose fire is in 
zion   
and his furnace in jerusalem   
 
behold  a king shall reign in 
 righteousness   
and as for princes  they shall rule in 
justice   
2and a man shall be as in a hiding 
place from the wind   
and a covert from the tempest   
as by the watercourses in a d ry 
place   
as in the shadow of a great rock in a 
weary land   
3and the eyes of them that see shall 
not be closed   
and the ears of them that hear shall 
attend   
4the heart also of the rash shall 
understand knowledge   and the tongue of the stammerers 
shall  be ready to speak plainly   
5the vile person shall be no more 
called liberal   
nor the churl said to be noble   
6for the vile person will speak 
villainy   
and his heart will work iniquity   
to practise ungodliness  and to utter 
wickedness against the lord  
to make empty the soul of the 
hungry   
and to cause the drink of the thirsty 
to fail   
7the instruments also of the churl 
are evil   
he deviseth wicked devices  
to destroy the poor with lying 
words   
and the needy when he speaketh 
right   
8but the liber al deviseth liberal 
things   
and by liberal things shall he stand   
 
9rise up  ye women that are at ease  
and hear my voice   
ye confident daughters  give ear 
unto my speech   
10after a year and days shall ye be 
troubled  ye confident women   
for the vinta ge shall fail  the 
ingathering shall not come   
11tremble  ye women that are at 
ease  
be troubled  ye confident ones   
strip you  and make you bare   
and gird sackcloth upon your loins   
12smiting upon the breasts  32 isaiah  
608 
 for the pleasant fields  for the 
fruitfu l vine   
13for the land of my people  
whereon thorns and briers come up   
yea for all the houses of joy  
and the joyous city   
14for the palace shall be forsaken   
the city with its stir shall be 
deserted   
the mound and the tower shall be 
for dens for ev er  
a joy of wild asses  a pasture of 
flocks   
15until the spirit be poured upon us 
from on high   
and the wilderness become a 
fruitful field   
and the fruitful field be counted for 
a forest   
16then justice shall dwell in the 
wilderness   
and righteousne ss shall abide in the 
fruitful field   
17and the work of righteousness 
shall be peace   
and the effect of righteousness 
quietness and confidence for ever   
18and my people shall abide in a 
peaceable habitation   
and in secure dwellings  and in 
quiet restin gplaces   
19and it shall hail  in the downfall of 
the forest   
but the city shall descend into the 
valley   
20happy are ye that sow beside all 
waters   
that send forth freely the feet of the 
ox and the ass    
woe to thee that spoilest  and 
 thou wast n ot spoiled   
and dealest treacherously  and they 
dealt not treacherously with thee   
when thou hast ceased to spoil  thou 
shalt be spoiled   
and when thou art weary with 
dealing treacherously  they shall 
deal treacherously with thee   
 
2o lord be gracious  unto us   
we have waited for thee   
be thou their arm every morning   
our salvation also in the time of 
trouble   
3at the noise of the tumult the 
peoples are fled   
at the lifting up of thyself the 
nations are scattered   
4and your spoil is gathered as th e 
caterpillar gathereth   
as locusts leap do they leap upon it   
5the lord is exalted  for he 
dwelleth on high   
he hath filled zion with justice and 
righteousness   
6and the stability of thy times shall 
be  
a hoard of salvation wisdom and 
knowledge   
and the fear of the lord which is 
his treasure   
 
7behold  their valiant ones cry 
without   
the ambassadors of peace weep 
bitterly   
8the highways lie waste   33 isaiah  
609 
 the wayfaring man ceaseth   
he hath broken the covenant   
he hath despised the cities   
he regardeth not man   
9the land mourneth and 
languisheth   
lebanon is ashamed  it withereth   
sharon is like a wilderness   
and bashan and carmel are clean

10now will i arise  saith the lord  
now will i be exalted   
now will i lift myself up   
11ye conceive c haff ye shall bring 
forth stubble   
your breath is a fire that shall 
devour you   
12and the peoples shall be as the 
burnings of lime   
as thorns cut down  that are burned 
in the fire   
 
13hear  ye that are far off  what i 
have done   
and ye that are near  acknowledge 
my might   
14the sinners in zion are afraid   
trembling hath seized the ungodly   
who among us shall dwell with the 
devouring fire   
who among us shall dwell with 
everlasting burnings   
15he that walketh righteously  and 
speaketh uprightly   
he that despiseth the gain of 
oppressions   
that shaketh his hands from holding 
of bribes   that stoppeth his ears from hearing 
of blood   
and shutteth his eyes from looking 
upon evil   
16he shall dwell on high   
his place of defence shall be the 
munitio ns of rocks   
his bread shall be given  his waters 
shall be sure   
 
17thine eyes shall see the king in his 
beauty   
they shall behold a land stretching 
afar  
18thy heart shall muse on the terror   
where is he that counted  where is 
he that weighed   
wher e is he that counted the 
towers   
19thou shalt not see the fierce 
people   
a people of a deep speech that thou 
canst not perceive   
of a stammering tongue that thou 
canst not understand   
20look upon zion  the city of our 
solemn gatherings   
thine eyes sh all see jerusalem a 
peaceful habitation   
a tent that shall not be removed   
the stakes whereof shall never be 
plucked up   
neither shall any of the cords 
thereof be broken   
21but there the lord will be with us 
in majesty   
in a place of broad rivers and 
streams   isaiah  
610 
 wherein shall go no galley with 
oars  
neither shall gallant ship pass 
thereby   
22for the lord is our judge   
the lord is our lawgiver   
the lord is our king   
he will save us   
23thy tacklings are loosed   
they do not hold the stand of their 
mast  
they do not spread the sail   
then is the prey of a great spoil 
divided   
the lame take the prey   
24and the inhabitant shall not say  i 
am sick   
the people that dwell therein shall 
be forgiven their iniquity   
 
come near  ye nations  to hear  
and attend  ye peoples   
let the earth hear  and the fulness 
thereof   
the world  and all things that come 
forth of it   
2for the lord hath indignation 
against all the nations   
and fury against all their host   
he hath utterly destroyed them   
he hath deli vered them to the 
slaughter   
3their slain also shall be cast out   
and the stench of their carcasses 
shall come up   
and the mountains shall be melted 
with their blood   
4and all the host of heaven shall 
moulder away   and the heavens shall be rolled 
together as a scroll   
and all their host shall fall down   
as the leaf falleth off from the vine   
and as a falling fig from the fig 
tree  
5for my sword hath drunk its fill in 
heaven   
behold  it shall come down upon 
edom   
and upon the people of my ban  to 
judgment   
6the sword of the lord is filled with 
blood   
it is made fat with fatness   
with the blood of lambs and goats   
with the fat of the kidneys of rams   
for the lord hath a sacrifice in 
bozrah   
and a great slaughter in the land of 
edom   
7and the wildoxen shall come 
down with them   
and the bullocks with the bulls   
and their land shall be drunken with 
blood   
and their dust made fat with 
fatness   
8for the lord hath a day of 
vengeance   
a year of recompense for the 
controversy of zion   
9and the streams thereof shall be 
turned into pitch   
and the dust thereof into brimstone   
and the land thereof shall become 
burning pitch   
10it shall not be quenched night nor 
day  34 isaiah  
611 
 the smoke thereof shall go up for 
ever  
from generation to generation it 
shall lie waste   
none shall pass through it for ever 
and ever   
11but the pelican and the bittern 
shall possess it   
and the owl and the raven shall 
dwell therein   
and he shall stretch over it  
the line of confusion  and the 
plummet of emptiness   
12as for her  nobles  none shall be 
there to be called to the kingdom   
and all her princes shall be nothing   
13and thorns shall come up in her 
palaces   
nettles and thistles in the fortresses 
thereof   
and it shall be a habitation of wild 
dogs   
an enclosure for ostr iches   
14and the wild cats shall meet with 
the jackals   
and the satyr shall cry to his fellow   
yea the night monster shall repose 
there   
and shall find her a place of rest   
15there shall the arrowsnake make 
her nest  and lay   
and hatch  and brood un der her 
shadow   
yea there shall the kites be 
gathered   
every one with her mate   
16seek ye out of the book of the 
lord and read   
no one of these shall be missing   none shall want her mate   
for my mouth it hath commanded   
and the breath thereof it h ath 
gathered them   
17and he hath cast the lot for them   
and his hand hath divided it unto 
them by line   
they shall possess it for ever   
from generation to generation shall 
they dwell therein   
 
the wilderness and the 
 parched  land shall be glad   
and the desert shall rejoice  and 
blossom as the rose   
2it shall blossom abundantly  and 
rejoice   
even with joy and singing   
the glory of lebanon shall be given 
unto it   
the excellency of carmel and 
sharon   
they shall see the glory of the lord  
the ex cellency of our god   
3strengthen ye the weak hands   
and make firm the tottering knees   
4say to them that are of a fearful 
heart  be strong  fear not   
behold  your god will come with 
vengeance   
with the recompense of god he 
will come and save you   
 
5then the eyes of the blind shall be 
opened   
and the ears of the deaf shall be 
unstopped   
6then shall the lame man leap as a 
hart  35 isaiah  
612 
 and the tongue of the dumb shall 
sing  
for in the wilderness shall waters 
break out   
and streams in the desert   
7and th e parched land shall become 
a pool   
and the thirsty ground springs of 
water   
in the habitation of jackals herds 
shall lie down   
it shall be an enclosure for reeds and 
rushes   
8and a highway shall be there  and a 
way  
and it shall be called the way of 
holiness   
the unclean shall not pass over it  
but it shall be for those   
the wayfaring men  yea fools  shall 
not err therein   
9no lion shall be there   
nor shall any ravenous beast go up 
thereon   
they shall not be found there   
but the redeemed shall w alk there   
10and the ransomed of the lord 
shall return   
and come with singing unto zion   
and everlasting joy shall be upon 
their heads   
they shall obtain gladness and joy   
and sorrow and sighing shall flee 
away   
 
now it came to pass in the 
fourtee nth year of king 
hezekiah  that sennacherib king of 
assyria came up against all the fortified cities of judah  and took 
them  2and the king of assyria sent 
rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem 
unto king hezekiah with a great army  
and he stood by the condu it of the 
upper pool in the highway of the 
fullers field 3then came forth unto 
him eliakim the son of hilkiah  that 
was over the household  and shebna 
the scribe  and joah the son of asaph 
the recorder  4and rab shakeh said 
unto them  say ye now to hezek iah 
thus saith the great king  the king of 
assyria  what confidence is this 
wherein thou trustest  5i said  it is but 
vain words  for counsel and strength 
are for the war  now on whom dost 
thou trust  that thou hast rebelled 
against me  6behold  thou trus test 
upon the staff of this bruised reed  
even upon egypt  whereon if a man 
lean it will go into his hand  and 
pierce it  so is pharaoh king of egypt 
to all that trust on him  7but if thou say 
unto me  we trust in the lord our 
god is not that he  whose h igh places 
and whose altars hezekiah hath taken 
away  and hath said to judah and to 
jerusalem  ye shall worship before 
this altar  8now therefore  i pray thee  
make a wager with my master  the 
king of assyria  and i will give thee 
two thousand horses  if thou be able on 
thy part to set riders upon them  9how 
then canst thou turn away the face of 
one captain  even of the least of my 
master s servants  yet thou puttest thy 
trust on egypt for chariots and for 
horsemen  10and am i now come up 36 isaiah  
613 
 without the lord against this land to 
destroy it  the lord said unto me  go 
up against this land  and destroy it   
11then said eliakim and shebna and 
joah unto rab shakeh  speak  i pray 
thee unto thy servants in the aramean 
language  for we understand it  and 
speak not t o us in the jews language  
in the ears of the people that are on the 
wall 12but rab shakeh said  hath 
my master sent me to thy master  and 
to thee  to speak these words  hath he 
not sent me to the men that sit upon 
the wall  to eat their own dung  and t o 
drink their own water with you  
13then rab shakeh stood  and cried 
with a loud voice in the 
jews language  and said  hear ye the 
words of the great king  the king of 
assyria  14thus saith the king  let not 
hezekiah beguile you  for he will not 
be able to deliver you  15neither let 
hezekiah make you trust in the lord 
saying  the lord will surely deliver 
us this city shall not be given into the 
hand of the king of assyria  16hearken 
not to hezekiah  for thus saith the king 
of assyria  make your peace wi th me  
and come out to me  and eat ye every 
one of his vine  and every one of his 
figtree and drink ye every one the 
waters of his own cistern  17until i 
come and take you away to a land like 
your own land  a land of corn and 
wine  a land of bread and vi neyards  
18beware lest hezekiah persuade you  
saying  the lord will deliver us  hath 
any of the gods of the nations 
delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria  19where are the 
gods of hamath and arpad  where are 
the gods of sepharvaim  and h ave 
they delivered samaria out of my 
hand  20who are they among all the 
gods of these countries  that have 
delivered their country out of my hand  
that the lord should deliver jerusalem 
out of my hand   
21but they held their peace  and 
answered him not a word  for the 
kings commandment was  saying  
answer him not  22then came 
eliakim the son of hilkiah  that was 
over the household  and shebna the 
scribe  and joah the son of asaph the 
recorder  to hezekiah with their 
clothes rent  and told him the words of 
rabshakeh   
and it came to pass  when 
king hezekiah heard it  that he 
rent his clothes  and covered himself 
with sackcloth  and went into the 
house of the lord 2and he sent 
eliakim  who was over the household  
and shebna the scribe  and the elders 
of the priests  covered with sackcloth  
unto isaiah the prophet the son of 
amoz  3and they said unto him  thus 
saith hezekiah  this day is a day of 
trouble  and of rebuke  and of 
contumely  for the children are come 
to the birth  and there is not strength  to 
bring forth  4it may be the lord thy 
god will hear the words of rab 
shakeh  whom the king of assyria his 
master hath sent to taunt the living 
god and will rebuke the words which 
the lord thy god hath heard  37 isaiah  
614 
 wherefore make prayer for the remnant 
that i s left  5so the servants of king 
hezekiah came to isaiah  6and isaiah 
said unto them  thus shall ye say to 
your master  thus saith the lord be 
not afraid of the words that thou hast 
heard  wherewith the servants of the 
king of assyria have blasphemed me  
7behold  i will put a spirit in him  and 
he shall hear a rumour  and shall return 
unto his own land  and i will cause 
him to fall by the sword in his own 
land  
8so rab shakeh returned  and found 
the king of assyria warring against 
libnah  for he had he ard that he was 
departed from lachish  9and he heard 
say concerning tirhakah king of 
ethiopia  he is come out to fight 
against thee  and when he heard it  he 
sent messengers to hezekiah  saying  
10thus shall ye speak to hezekiah 
king of judah  saying  let not thy god 
in whom thou trustest beguile thee  
saying  jerusalem shall not be given 
into the hand of the king of assyria  
11behold  thou hast heard what the 
kings of assyria have done to all 
lands  by destroying them utterly  and 
shalt thou be delivere d 12have the 
gods of the nations delivered them  
which my fathers have destroyed  
gozan  and haran  and rezeph  and 
the children of eden that were in 
telassar  13where is the king of 
hamath  and the king of arpad  and 
the king of the city of sepharvaim  of 
hena  and ivvah   14and hezekiah received the letter 
from the hand of the messengers  and 
read it  and hezekiah went up unto the 
house of the lord and spread it before 
the lord 15and hezekiah prayed unto 
the lord saying  16o lord of hosts  
the god o f israel  that sittest upon the 
cherubim  thou art the god  even 
thou alone  of all the kingdoms of the 
earth  thou hast made heaven and 
earth  17incline thine ear  o lord and 
hear open thine eyes  o lord and 
see and hear all the words of 
sennacherib  who hath sent to taunt 
the living god  18of a truth  lord the 
kings of assyria have laid waste all the 
countries  and their land  19and have 
cast their gods into the fire  for they 
were no gods  but the work of men s 
hands  wood and stone  therefore they 
have destroyed them  20now therefore  
o lord our god  save us from his 
hand  that all the kingdoms of the earth 
may know that thou art the lord 
even thou only   
21then isaiah the son of amoz sent 
unto hezekiah  saying  thus saith the 
lord the god of is rael whereas thou 
hast prayed to me against sennacherib 
king of assyria  22this is the word 
which the lord hath spoken 
concerning him   
the virgin daughter of zion  
hath despised thee and laughed thee 
to scorn   
the daughter of jerusalem  
hath shaken her head at thee   
23whom hast thou taunted and 
blasphemed   isaiah  
615 
 and against whom hast thou exalted 
thy voice   
yea thou hast lifted up thine eyes 
on high   
even against the holy one of israel   
24by thy servants hast thou taunted 
the lord   
and hast said  with t he multitude of 
my chariots  
am i come up to the height of the 
mountains   
to the innermost parts of lebanon   
and i have cut down the tall cedars 
thereof   
and the choice cypress trees 
thereof   
and i have entered into his farthest 
height   
the forest of his fruitful field   
25i have digged and drunk water   
and with the sole of my feet have i 
dried up  
all the rivers of egypt   
26hast thou not heard   
long ago i made it   
in ancient times i fashioned it   
now have i brought it to pass   
yea it is done  that fortified cities  
should be laid waste into ruinous 
heaps   
27therefore their inhabitants were of 
small power   
they were dismayed and 
confounded   
they were as the grass of the field   
and as the green herb   
as the grass on the housetops   
and as a f ield of corn before it is 
grown up    
28but i know thy sitting down  and 
thy going out  and thy coming in   
and thy raging against me   
29because of thy raging against me   
and for that thine uproar is come up 
into mine ears   
therefore will i put my hook in thy 
nose  
and my bridle in thy lips   
and i will turn thee back by the way  
by which thou camest   
30and this shall be the sign unto thee  
ye shall eat this year that which 
groweth of itself  and in the second 
year that which springeth of the same  
and in the third year sow ye  and reap  
and plant vineyards  and eat the fruit 
thereof  31and the remnant that is 
escaped of the house of judah shall 
again take root downward  and bear 
fruit upward  32for out of jerusalem 
shall go forth a remnant  and out of 
mount zion they that shall escape  the 
zeal of the lord of hosts shall perform 
this 33therefore thus saith the lord 
concerning the king of assyria  he 
shall not come unto this city  nor shoot 
an arrow there  neither shall he come 
before it with shield  nor cast a mound 
against it  34by the way that he came  
by the same shall he return  and he 
shall not come unto this city  saith the 
lord 35for i will defend this city to 
save it  for mine own sake  and for my 
servant david s sake  36and the angel 
of the lord went forth  and smote in 
the camp of the assyrians a hundred 
and fourscore and five thousand  and isaiah  
616 
 when men arose early in the morning  
behold  they were all dead corpses  
37so sennacherib king of assyria 
departed  and went  and returned  and 
dwelt at n ineveh  38and it came to 
pass as he was worshipping in the 
house of nisroch his god  that 
adrammelech and sarezer his sons 
smote him with the sword  and they 
escaped into the land of ararat  and 
esarhaddon his son reigned in his 
stead   
in those days w as hezekiah 
sick unto death  and isaiah the 
prophet the son of amoz came to him  
and said unto him  thus saith the 
lord set thy house in order  for thou 
shalt die  and not live  2then 
hezekiah turned his face to the wall  
and prayed unto the lord 3and said 
remember now  o lord i beseech 
thee  how i have walked before thee 
in truth and with a whole heart  and 
have done that which is good in thy 
sight  and hezekiah wept sore  4then 
came the word of the lord to isaiah  
saying  5go and say to hezekiah  
thus saith the lord the god of david 
thy father  i have heard thy prayer  i 
have seen thy tears  behold  i will add 
unto thy days fifteen years  6and i will 
deliver thee and this city out of the 
hand of the king of assyria  and i will 
defend this city  7and this shall be the 
sign unto thee from the lord that the 
lord will do this thing that he hath 
spoken  8behold  i will cause the 
shadow of the dial  which is gone 
down on the sun dial of ahaz  to return backward ten degrees  so the 
sun returned ten de grees  by which 
degrees it was gone down   
 
9the writing of hezekiah king of 
judah  when he had been sick  and was 
recovered of his sickness   
10i said  in the noontide of my days i 
shall go   
even to the gates of the nether 
world   
i am deprived of the re sidue of my 
years   
11i said  i shall not see the lord  
even the lord in the land of the 
living   
i shall behold man no more with the 
inhabitants of the world   
12my habitation is plucked up and 
carried away from me  
as a shepherd s tent   
i have rolled u p like a weaver my 
life  
he will cut me off from the thrum   
from day even to night wilt thou 
make an end of me   
13the more i make myself like unto 
a lion until morning   
the more it breaketh all my bones   
from day even to night wilt thou 
make an end of  me  
14like a swallow or a crane  so do i 
chatter   
i do moan as a dove   
mine eyes fail with looking upward   
o lord i am oppressed  be thou 
my surety   
 38 isaiah  
617 
 15what shall i say  he hath both 
spoken unto me   
and himself hath done it   
i shall go softly all my years for the 
bitterness of my soul   
16o lord  by these things men live   
and altogether therein is the life of 
my spirit   
wherefore recover thou me  and 
make me to live   
17behold  for my peace i had great 
bitterness   
but thou hast in love to my sou l 
delivered it  
from the pit of corruption   
for thou hast cast all my sins 
behind thy back   
 
18for the nether world cannot praise 
thee   
death cannot celebrate thee   
they that go down into the pit 
cannot hope for thy truth   
19the living  the living  he shall 
praise thee   
as i do this day   
the father to the children shall make 
known thy truth   
20the lord is ready to save me   
therefore we will sing songs to the 
stringed instruments  
all the days of our life in the house 
of the lord  
 
21and isaiah sai d let them take a 
cake of figs  and lay it for a plaster 
upon the boil  and he shall recover  
22and hezekiah said  what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the 
lord  
at that time merodach 
baladan the son of baladan  
king of babylon  sent a letter and a 
present to hezekiah  for he heard that 
he had been sick  and was recovered  
2and hezekiah was glad of them  and 
showed them his treasure house  the 
silver  and the gold  and the spices  
and the precious oil  and all the house 
of his armour  and all that was found 
in his treasures  there was nothing in 
his house  nor in all his dominion  that 
hezekiah showed them not  3then 
came isaiah the prophet unto king 
hezekiah  and said unto him  what 
said these men  and from whence 
came they unto the e and hezekiah 
said they are come from a far 
country unto me  even from babylon  
4then said he  what have they seen in 
thy house  and hezekiah answered  
all that is in my house have they 
seen there is nothing among my 
treasures that i have not sho wn them  
5then said isaiah to hezekiah  hear 
the word of the lord of hosts  
6behold  the days come  that all that is 
in thy house  and that which thy 
fathers have laid up in store until this 
day shall be carried to babylon  
nothing shall be left  saith the lord 
7and of thy sons that shall issue from 
thee whom thou shalt beget  shall they 
take away  and they shall be officers in 
the palace of the king of babylon  
8then said hezekiah unto isaiah  
good is the word of the lord which 39 isaiah  
618 
 thou hast spoken  he said moreover  
if but there shall be peace and truth in 
my days   
 
comfort ye  comfort ye my 
 people   
saith your god   
2bid jerusalem take heart   
and proclaim unto her   
that her time of service is 
accomplished   
that her guilt is paid off   
that she hath received of the 
lords hand  
double for all her sins   
 
3hark  one calleth   
clear ye in the wilderness the way 
of the lord  
make plain in the desert  
a highway for our god   
4every valley shall be lifted up   
and every mountain and hill shall 
be made low   
and the rugged shall be made level   
and the rough places a plain   
5and the glory of the lord shall be 
revealed   
and all flesh shall see it together   
for the mouth of the lord hath 
spoken it   
 
6hark  one saith  proclaim    
and he saith  what shall i 
proclaim   
all flesh is grass   
and all the goodliness thereof is as 
the flower of the field   7the grass withereth  the flower 
fadeth   
because the breath of the lord 
bloweth upon it  
surely the people is grass   
8the grass withereth  the flower 
fadeth   
but the word of our god shall stand 
for ever   
 
9o thou that tellest good tidings to 
zion   
get thee up into the high mountain   
o thou that tellest good tidings to 
jerusalem   
lift up thy voice with strength   
lift it up  be not afraid   
say unto the cities of judah   
behold your god    
10behold  the lord g od will come as 
a mighty one   
and his arm will rule for him   
behold  his reward is with him   
and his recompense before him   
11even as a shepherd that feedeth his 
flock   
that gathe reth the lambs in his arm   
and carrieth them in his bosom   
and gently leadeth those that give 
suck  
 
12who hath measured the waters in 
the hollow of his hand   
and meted out heaven with the 
span  
and comprehended the dust of the 
earth in a measure   
and weighed the mountains in 
scales   40 isaiah  
619 
 and the hills in a balance   
13who hath meted out the spirit of 
the lord  
or who was his counsellor that he 
might instruct him   
14with whom took he counsel  and 
who instructed him   
and taught him in the path of right   
and taught him knowledge   
and made him to know the way of 
discernment   
15behold  the nations are as a drop 
of a bucket   
and are counted as the small dust of 
the balance   
behold the isles are as a mote in 
weight   
16and lebanon is not sufficient fuel   
nor the beasts thereof sufficient for 
burnt offerings   
17all the nations are as nothing 
before him   
they are accounted by him as 
things of nought  and vanity   
18to whom then will ye liken god   
or what likeness will ye compare 
unto him   
19the image p erchance  which the 
craftsman hath melted   
and the goldsmith spread over with 
gold  
the silversmith casting silver 
chains   
20a holm oak is set apart   
he chooseth a tree that will not rot   
he seeketh unto him a cunning 
craftsman  
to set up an image  that shall not be 
moved    
21know ye not  hear ye not   
hath it not been told you from the 
beginning   
have ye not understood the 
foundations of the earth   
22it is he that sitteth above the circle 
of the earth   
and the inhabitants thereof are as 
grasshoppe rs  
that stretcheth out the heavens as a 
curtain   
and spreadeth them out as a tent to 
dwell in   
23that bringeth princes to nothing   
he maketh the judges of the earth as 
a thing of nought   
24scarce are they planted   
scarce are they sown   
scarce hath their stock taken root in 
the earth   
when he bloweth upon them  they 
wither   
and the whirlwind taketh them 
away as stubble   
25to whom then will ye liken me  
that i should be equal   
saith the holy one   
26lift up your eyes on high   
and see  who hath cr eated these   
he that bringeth out their host by 
number   
he calleth them all by name   
by the greatness of his might  and 
for that he is strong in power   
not one faileth   
 
27why sayest thou  o jacob   
and speakest  o israel   isaiah  
620 
 my way is hid from the lord  
and my right is passed over from 
my god   
28hast thou not known  hast thou 
not heard  
that the everlasting god  the lord  
the creator of the ends of the earth   
fainteth not  neither is weary   
his discernment is past searching 
out  
29he giveth powe r to the faint   
and to him that hath no might he 
increaseth strength   
30even the youths shall faint and be 
weary   
and the young men shall utterly 
fall  
31but they that wait for the lord 
shall renew their strength   
they shall mount up with wings as 
eagles  
they shall run  and not be weary   
they shall walk  and not faint   
 
keep silence before me  o 
 islands   
and let the peoples renew their 
strength   
let them draw near  then let them 
speak   
let us come near together to 
judgment   
2who hath raised  up one from the 
east  
at whose steps victory attendeth   
he giveth nations before him   
and maketh him rule over kings   
his sword maketh them as the dust   
his bow as the driven stubble   3he pursueth them  and passeth on 
safely   
the way with his feet he treadeth 
not  
4who hath wrought and done it   
he that called the generations from 
the beginning   
i the lord who am the first   
and with the last am the same   
5the isles saw  and feared   
the ends of the earth trembled   
they drew near  and came   
 
6they helped every one his 
neighbour   
and every one said to his brother   
be of good courage   
7so the carpenter encouraged the 
goldsmith   
and he that smootheth with the 
hammer him that smiteth the 
anvil   
saying of the soldering  it is good   
and he  fastened it with nails  that it 
should not be moved   
 
8but thou  israel  my servant   
jacob whom i have chosen   
the seed of abraham my friend   
9thou whom i have taken hold of 
from the ends of the earth   
and called thee from the uttermost 
parts thereof   
and said unto thee  thou art my 
servant   
i have chosen thee and not cast thee 
away   
10fear thou not  for i am with thee   
be not dismayed  for i am thy god   41 isaiah  
621 
 i strengthen thee  yea i help thee   
yea i uphold thee with my 
victorious right hand   
11behold  all they that were incensed 
against thee  
shall be ashamed and confounded   
they that strove with thee  
shall be as nothing  and shall perish   
12thou shalt seek them  and shalt 
not find them   
even them that contended with thee   
they that warred against thee  
shall be as nothing  and as a thing 
of nought   
13for i the lord thy god  
hold thy right hand   
who say unto thee  fear not   
i help thee   
 
14fear not  thou worm jacob   
and ye men of israel   
i help thee  saith the lord  
and thy redeemer  the holy one of 
israel   
15behold  i make thee a new 
threshing sledge  
having sharp teeth   
thou shalt thresh the mountains  
and beat them small   
and shalt make the hills as chaff   
16thou shalt fan them  and the wind 
shall carry them away   
and the whi rlwind shall scatter 
them   
and thou shalt rejoice in the lord  
thou shalt glory in the holy one of 
israel   
 17the poor and needy seek water 
and there is none   
and their tongue faileth for thirst   
i the lord will answer them   
i the god of israel will not forsake 
them   
18i will open rivers on the high hills   
and fountains in the midst of the 
valleys   
i will make the wilderness a pool of 
water   
and the dry land springs of water   
19i will plant in the wilderness the 
cedar  the acacia tree  
and the m yrtle and the oil tree  
i will set in the desert the cypress  
the plane tree and the larch 
together   
20that they may see  and know   
and consider  and understand 
together   
that the hand of the lord hath done 
this  
and the holy one of israel hath 
created it   
 
21produce your cause  saith the 
lord  
bring forth your reasons  saith the 
king of jacob   
22let them bring them forth  and 
declare unto us  
the things that shall happen   
the former things  what are they   
declare ye  that we may consider   
and know the end of them   
or announce to us things to come   
23declare the things that are to come 
hereafter   isaiah  
622 
 that we may know that ye are gods   
yea do good  or do evil   
that we may be dismayed  and 
behold it together   
24behold  ye are nothing   
and your  work a thing of nought   
an abomination is he that chooseth 
you  
 
25i have roused up one from the 
north  and he is come   
from the rising of the sun one that 
calleth upon my name   
and he shall come upon rulers as 
upon mortar   
and as the potter treadeth  clay  
26who hath declared from the 
beginning  that we may know   
and beforetime  that we may say 
that he is right   
yea there is none that declareth   
yea there is none that announceth   
yea there is none that heareth your 
utterances   
27a harbinger u nto zion will i give  
behold  behold them   
and to jerusalem a messenger of 
good tidings   
28and i look  but there is no man   
even among them  but there is no 
counsellor   
that when i ask of them  can give 
an answer   
29behold  all of them   
their work s are vanity and nought   
their molten images are wind and 
confusion   
 behold my servant  whom i 
 uphold   
mine elect  in whom my soul 
delighteth   
i have put my spirit upon him   
he shall make the right to go forth 
to the nations   
2he shall not cry  nor lift up   
nor cause his voice to be heard in 
the street   
3a bruised reed shall he not break   
and the dimly burning wick shall he 
not quench   
he shall make the right to go forth 
according to the truth   
4he shall not fail nor be crushed   
till he hav e set the right in the 
earth   
and the isles shall wait for his 
teaching   
5thus saith god the lord  
he that created the heavens  and 
stretched them forth   
he that spread forth the earth and 
that which cometh out of it   
he that giveth breath unto the 
people upon it   
and spirit to them that walk therein   
6i the lord have called thee in 
righteousness   
and have taken hold of thy hand   
and kept thee  and set thee for a 
covenant of the people   
for a light of the nations   
7to open the blind eyes   
to bring out the prisoners from the 
dungeon   
and them that sit in darkness out of 
the prison house   42 isaiah  
623 
 8i am the lord that is my name   
and my glory will i not give to 
another   
neither my praise to graven images   
9behold  the former things are come 
to pass   
and new things do i declare   
before they spring forth i tell you of 
them   
10sing unto the lord a new song   
and his praise from the end of the 
earth   
ye that go down to the sea  and all 
that is therein   
the isles  and the inhabitants 
thereof   
11let the  wilderness and the cities 
thereof lift up their voice   
the villages that kedar doth inhabit   
let the inhabitants of sela exult   
let them shout from the top of the 
mountains   
12let them give glory unto the lord  
and declare his praise in the 
islands   
13the lord will go forth as a mighty 
man  
he will stir up jealousy like a man 
of war   
he will cry  yea he will shout 
aloud   
he will prove himself mighty 
against his enemies   
 
14i have long time held my peace   
i have been still  and refrained 
myself   
now will i cry like a travailing 
woman   gasping and panting at once   
15i will make waste mountains and 
hills  
and dry up all their herbs   
and i will make the rivers islands   
and will dry up the pools   
16and i will bring the blind by a 
way that they  knew not   
in paths that they knew not will i 
lead them   
i will make darkness light before 
them  and rugged places plain   
these things will i do   
and i will not leave them undone   
17they shall be turned back  greatly 
ashamed   
that trust in graven ima ges  
that say unto molten images   
ye are our gods   
 
18hear  ye deaf   
and look  ye blind  that ye may see   
19who is blind  but my servant   
or deaf  as my messenger that i 
send  
who is blind as he that is 
wholehearted   
and blind as the l ords serva nt  
20seeing many things  thou 
observest not   
opening the ears  he heareth not   
21the lord was pleased  for his 
righteousness sake  
to make the teaching great and 
glorious   
22but this is a people robbed and 
spoiled   
they are all of them snared in hol es  
and they are hid in prison houses   isaiah  
624 
 they are for a prey  and none 
delivereth   
for a spoil  and none saith  
restore   
23who among you will give ear to 
this who will hearken and hear 
for the time to come   
24who gave jacob for a spoil  and 
israel to  the robbers   
did not the lord  
he against whom we have sinned   
and in whose ways they would not 
walk   
neither were they obedient unto his 
law  
25therefore he poured upon him the 
fury of his anger   
and the strength of battle   
and it set him on fire round about  
yet he knew not   
and it burned him  yet he laid it not 
to heart   
 
but now thus saith the lord 
 that  created thee  o jacob   
and he that formed thee  o israel   
fear not  for i have redeemed thee   
i have called thee by thy name  thou 
art mine   
2when thou passest through the 
waters  i will be with thee   
and through the rivers  they shall 
not overflow thee   
when thou walkest through the fire  
thou shalt not be burned   
neither shall the flame kindle upon 
thee  
3for i am the lord thy god   
the holy one of israel  thy saviour   i have given egypt as thy ransom   
ethiopia and seba for thee   
4since thou art precious in my sight  
and honourable   
and i have loved thee   
therefore will i give men for thee   
and peoples for thy life   
5fear no t for i am with thee   
i will bring thy seed from the east   
and gather thee from the west   
6i will say to the north  give up   
and to the south  keep not back   
bring my sons from far   
and my daughters from the end of 
the earth   
7every one that is called by my 
name   
and whom i have created for my 
glory   
i have formed him  yea i have made 
him  
8the blind people that have eyes 
shall be brought forth   
and the deaf that have ears   
9all the nations are gathered 
together   
and the peoples are assem bled  
who among them can declare this   
and announce to us former things   
let them bring their witnesses  that 
they may be justified   
and let them hear  and say  it is 
truth   
10ye are my witnesses  saith the 
lord  
and my servant whom i have 
chosen   
that ye may know and believe me  
and understand  43 isaiah  
625 
 that i am he   
before me there was no god 
formed   
neither shall any be after me   
 
11i even i  am the lord  
and beside me there is no saviour   
12i have declared  and i have saved   
and i have announced   
and there was no strange god 
among you   
therefore ye are my witnesses  saith 
the lord and i am god   
13yea since the day was i am he   
and there is none that can deliver 
out of my hand   
i will work  and who can reverse it   
 
14thus saith the lord your 
redeemer   
the holy one of israel   
for your sake i have sent to 
babylon   
and i will bring down all of them as 
fugitives   
even the chaldeans  in the ships of 
their shouting   
15i am the lord your holy one   
the creator of israel  your king   
 
16thus saith the lord who maketh a 
way in the sea   
and a path in the mighty waters   
17who bringeth forth the chariot and 
horse   
the army and the power  
they lie down together  they shall 
not rise   they are extinct  they are quenched 
as a wick   
18remember ye  not the former 
things   
neither consider the things of old   
19behold  i will do a new thing   
now shall it spring forth  shall ye 
not know it   
i will even make a way in the 
wilderness   
and rivers in the desert   
20the beasts of the field shall 
honour m e  
the jackals and the ostriches   
because i give waters in the 
wilderness   
and rivers in the desert   
to give drink to my people  mine 
elect   
21the people which i formed for 
myself   
that they might tell of my praise   
 
22yet thou hast not called upon me 
o jacob   
neither hast thou wearied thyself 
about me  o israel   
23thou hast not brought me the 
small cattle of thy burnt 
offerings   
neither hast thou honoured me with 
thy sacrifices   
i have not burdened thee with a 
meal offering   
nor wearied thee w ith frankincense   
24thou hast bought me no sweet 
cane with money   
neither hast thou satisfied me with 
the fat of thy sacrifices   isaiah  
626 
 but thou hast burdened me with thy 
sins  
thou hast wearied me with thine 
iniquities   
25i even i  am he that blotteth out 
thy transgressions for mine own 
sake  
and thy sins i will not remember   
26put me in remembrance  let us 
plead together   
declare thou  that thou mayest be 
justified   
27thy first father sinned   
and thine intercessors have 
transgressed against me   
28therefore i have profaned the 
princes of the sanctuary   
and i have given jacob to 
condemnation   
and israel to reviling   
 
yet now hear  o jacob my 
 servant   
and israel  whom i have chosen   
2thus saith the lord that made thee   
and formed thee from the womb  
who will help thee   
fear not  o jacob my servant   
and thou  jeshurun  whom i have 
chosen   
3for i will pour water upon the 
thirsty land   
and streams upon the dry ground   
i will pour my spirit upon thy seed   
and my blessing upon thine 
offspring   
4and they shall spring up among the 
grass   
as willows by the watercourses   5one shall say  i am the l ords  
and another shall call himself by 
the name of jacob   
and another shall subscribe with his 
hand unto the lord  
and surname himself by the nam e 
of israel   
 
6thus saith the lord the king of 
israel   
and his redeemer the lord of 
hosts   
i am the first  and i am the last   
and beside me there is no god   
7and who  as i can proclaim  
let him declare it  and set it in order 
for me  
since i appoint ed the ancient 
people   
and the things that are coming  and 
that shall come to pass  let them 
declare   
8fear ye not  neither be afraid   
have i not announced unto thee of 
old and declared it   
and ye are my witnesses   
is there a god beside me   
yea there is no rock  i know not 
any  
 
9they that fashion a graven image 
are all of them vanity   
and their delectable things shall not 
profit   
and their own witnesses see not  
nor know   
that they may be ashamed   
10who hath fashioned a god  or 
molten an image   44 isaiah  
627 
 that is profitable for nothing   
11behold  all the fellows thereof 
shall be ashamed   
and the craftsmen skilled above 
men  
let them all be gathered together  
let them stand up   
they shall fear  they shall be 
ashamed together   
 
12the smith maketh an ax e  
and worketh in the coals  and 
fashioneth it with hammers   
and worketh it with his strong arm   
yea he is hungry  and his strength 
faileth   
he drinketh no water  and is faint   
13the carpenter stretcheth out a line   
he marketh it out with a pencil   
he fitteth it with planes   
and he marketh it out with the 
compasses   
and maketh it after the figure of a 
man  
according to the beauty of a man  to 
dwell in the house   
14he heweth him down cedars   
and taketh the ilex and the oak   
and strengtheneth fo r himself one 
among the trees of the forest   
he planteth a bay tree and the rain 
doth nourish it   
15then a man useth it for fuel   
and he taketh thereof  and warmeth 
himself   
yea he kindleth it  and baketh 
bread   
yea he maketh a god  and 
worshippeth  it  he maketh it a graven image  and 
falleth down thereto   
16he burneth the half thereof in the 
fire  
with the half thereof he eateth flesh   
he roasteth roast  and is satisfied   
yea he warmeth himself  and saith  
aha  
i am warm  i have seen the fi re  
17and the residue thereof he maketh 
a god  even his graven image   
he falleth down unto it and 
worshippeth  and prayeth unto it   
and saith  deliver me  for thou art 
my god   
 
18they know not  neither do they 
understand   
for their eyes are bedaube d that 
they cannot see   
and their hearts  that they cannot 
understand   
19and none considereth in his heart   
neither is there knowledge nor 
understanding to say   
i have burned the half of it in the 
fire  
yea also i have baked bread upon 
the coals th ereof   
i have roasted flesh and eaten it   
and shall i make the residue thereof 
an abomination   
shall i fall down to the stock of a 
tree  
20he striveth after ashes   
a deceived heart hath turned him 
aside   
that he cannot deliver his soul  nor 
say  isaiah  
628 
 is there not a lie in my right hand   
 
21remember these things  o jacob   
and israel  for thou art my servant   
i have formed thee  thou art mine 
own servant   
o israel  thou shouldest not forget 
me  
22i have blotted out  as a thick cloud  
thy transgressi ons  
and as a cloud  thy sins   
return unto me  for i have 
redeemed thee   
23sing o ye heavens  for the lord 
hath done it   
shout ye lowest parts of the earth   
break forth into singing  ye 
mountains   
o forest  and every tree therein   
for the lord hath redeemed jacob   
and doth glorify himself in israel   
 
24thus saith the lord thy 
redeemer   
and he that formed thee from the 
womb   
i am the lord that maketh all 
things   
that stretched forth the heavens 
alone   
that spread abroad the earth by 
myself   
25that frustrateth the tokens of the 
imposters   
and maketh diviners mad   
that turneth wise men backward   
and maketh their knowledge 
foolish   26that confirmeth the word of his 
servant   
and performeth the counsel of his 
messengers   
that saith of jeru salem  she shall 
be inhabited   
and of the cities of judah  they 
shall be built   
and i will raise up the waste places 
thereof   
27that saith to the deep  be dry  
and i will dry up thy rivers   
28that saith of cyrus  he is my 
shepherd   
and shall pe rform all my pleasure   
even saying of jerusalem  she 
shall be built   
and to the temple  my foundation 
shall be laid   
 
thus saith the lord to his 
 anointed   
to cyrus  whose right hand i have 
holden   
to subdue nations before him   
and to loose t he loins of kings   
to open the doors before him   
and that the gates may not be shut   
2i will go before thee   
and make the crooked places 
straight   
i will break in pieces the doors of 
brass   
and cut in sunder the bars of iron   
3and i will give thee t he treasures of 
darkness   
and hidden riches of secret places   
that thou mayest know that i am the 
lord  45 isaiah  
629 
 who call thee by thy name  even the 
god of israel   
4for the sake of jacob my servant   
and israel mine elect   
i have called thee by thy name   
i have surnamed thee  though thou 
hast not known me   
5i am the lord and there is none 
else  
beside me there is no god   
i have girded thee  though thou hast 
not known me   
6that they may know from the 
rising of the sun  and from the 
west  
that there is non e beside me   
i am the lord and there is none 
else  
7i form the light  and create 
darkness   
i make peace  and create evil   
i am the lord that doeth all these 
things   
 
8drop down  ye heavens  from 
above   
and let the skies pour down 
righteousness   
let the earth open  that they may 
bring forth salvation   
and let her cause righteousness to 
spring up together   
i the lord have created it   
 
9woe unto him that striveth with his 
maker   
as a potsherd with the potsherds of 
the earth   shall the clay say to  him that 
fashioned it  what makest thou   
or thy work  it hath no hands   
10woe unto him that saith unto his 
father  wherefore begettest 
thou  
or to a woman  wherefore 
travailest thou   
 
11thus saith the lord  
the holy one of israel  and his 
maker  
ask me of the things that are to 
come   
concerning my sons  and 
concerning the work of my 
hands  command ye me   
12i even i  have made the earth   
and created man upon it   
i even my hands  have stretched out 
the heavens   
and all their host have i  
commanded   
13i have roused him up in victory   
and i make level all his ways   
he shall build my city   
and he shall let mine exiles go free   
not for price nor reward   
saith the lord of hosts   
 
14thus saith the lord  
the labour of egypt  and the 
merc handise of ethiopia   
and of the sabeans  men of stature   
shall come over unto thee  and they 
shall be thine   
they shall go after thee  in chains 
they shall come over   
and they shall fall down unto thee   isaiah  
630 
 they shall make supplication unto 
thee  
surely god is in thee  and there is 
none else   
there is no other god   
15verily thou art a god that hidest 
thyself   
o god of israel  the saviour   
16they shall be ashamed  yea 
confounded  all of them   
they shall go in confusion together 
that are makers of ido ls  
17o israel  that art saved by the lord 
with an everlasting salvation   
ye shall not be ashamed nor 
confounded world without end   
 
18for thus saith the lord that created 
the heavens   
he is god   
that formed the earth and made it   
he established it   
he created it not a waste  he formed 
it to be inhabited   
i am the lord and there is none 
else  
19i have not spoken in secret   
in a place of the land of darkness   
i said not unto the seed of jacob   
seek ye me in vain   
i the lord speak righteousnes s  
i declare things that are right   
20assemble yourselves and come  
draw near together   
ye that are escaped of the nations   
they have no knowledge that carry 
the wood of their graven image   
and pray unto a god that cannot 
save  21declare ye  and brin g them near   
yea let them take counsel together   
who hath announced this from 
ancient time   
and declared it of old   
have not i the lord  
and there is no god else beside me   
a just god and a saviour   
there is none beside me   
22look unto me  and be ye saved   
all the ends of the earth   
for i am god  and there is none 
else  
23by myself have i sworn   
the word is gone forth from my 
mouth in righteousness   
and shall not come back   
that unto me every knee shall bow   
every tongue shall swear   
24only  in the lord shall one say of 
me is victory and strength   
even to him shall men come in 
confusion   
all they that were incensed against 
him  
25in the lord shall all the seed of 
israel  
be justified  and shall glory

a burden to the weary beast

631 
 and themselves are gone into 
captivity   
3hearken unto me  o house of 
jacob   
and all the remnant of the house of 
israel   
that are borne by me  from the 
birth   
that are carried from the womb   
4even to old age i am the same   
and even to hoar hairs will i carry 
you

yea i will carry  and will deliver   
 
5to whom will ye liken me  and

cannot answer   
nor save him out of his trouble

beginning   
and from ancient times things that 
are not yet done   
saying  my counsel shall stand   
and all my pleasure will i do   
11calling a bird of prey from the 
east  
the man of my counsel from a far 
country   
yea i have spoken  i will also bring 
it to pass   
i have purposed  i will also do it   
 
12hearken unto me  ye stout 
hearted   
that are far from righteousness   
13i bring near my righteousness  it 
shall not be far off   
and my salvation shall not tarry   
and i will place salvation in zion  
for israel my glory   
 
come down  and sit in the 
 dust  
o virgin daughter of babylon   
sit on the ground without a throne   
o daughter of the chaldeans   
for thou shalt no more be called  
tender and delicate   
2take the millstones  and grind 
meal   
remove thy veil   
strip off the train  uncover the leg   
pass through the rivers   
3thy nakedness shall be uncovered   47 isaiah  
632 
 yea thy shame shall be seen   
i will take vengeance   
and will let no man intercede   
4our redeemer  the lord of hosts is 
his name   
the holy one of israel   
5sit thou silent  and get thee into 
darkness  
o daughter of the chaldeans   
for thou shalt no more be called  
the mistress of kingdoms   
6i was wroth with my people   
i profaned mine inheritance   
and gave them into thy hand   
thou didst show them no mercy   
upon the aged hast thou very 
heavily   
laid thy yoke   
7and thou saidst   
for ever shall i be mistress   
so that thou didst not lay these 
things to thy heart   
neither didst remember the end 
thereof   
 
8now therefore hear this  thou that 
art given to pleasures   
that sittest securely   
that sayest in thy heart   
i am and there is none else beside 
me  
i shall not sit as a widow   
neither shall i know the loss of 
children   
9but these two things shall come to 
thee in a moment  
in one day  the loss of children  and 
widow hood   in their ful l measure shall they come 
upon thee   
for the multitude of thy sorceries   
and the great abundance of thine 
enchantments   
 
10and thou hast been secure in thy 
wickedness   
thou hast said  none seeth me   
thy wisdom and thy knowledge   
it hath perverted t hee  
and thou hast said in thy heart   
i am and there is none else beside 
me  
11yet shall evil came upon thee   
thou shalt not know how to charm 
it away   
and calamity shall fall upon thee   
thou shalt not be able to put it 
away   
and ruin shall come upon thee 
suddenly   
before thou knowest   
 
12stand now with thine 
enchantments   
and with the multitude of thy 
sorceries   
wherein thou hast laboured from 
thy youth   
if so be thou shalt be able to profit   
if so be thou mayest prevail   
13thou art wearie d in the multitude 
of thy counsels   
let now the astrologers  the 
stargazers   
the monthly prognosticators   
stand up  and save thee  isaiah  
633 
 from the things that shall come 
upon thee   
14behold  they shall be as stubble   
the fire shall burn them   
they shall not  deliver themselves  
from the power of the flame   
it shall not be a coal to warm at   
nor a fire to sit before   
15thus shall they be unto thee  
with whom thou hast laboured   
they that have trafficked with thee 
from thy youth  
shall wander every one to h is 
quarter   
there shall be none to save thee   
 
hear ye this  o house of 
 jacob   
who are called by the name of   
   israel   
and are come forth out of the 
fountain of judah   
who swear by the name of the 
lord  
and make mention of the god of 
israel   
but not in truth  nor in 
righteousness   
2for they call themselves of the holy 
city  
and stay themselves upon the god 
of israel   
the lord of hosts is his name   
3i have declared the former things 
from of old   
yea they went forth out of my 
mouth  and i announced them   
suddenly i did them  and they came 
to pass   4because i knew that thou art 
obstinate   
and thy neck is an iron sinew  and 
thy brow brass   
5therefore i have declared it to thee 
from of old   
before it came to pass i announced 
it to thee   
lest thou shouldest say  mine idol 
hath done them   
and my graven image  and my 
molten image  hath commanded 
them   
6thou hast heard  see all this   
and ye  will ye not declare it   
i have announced unto thee new 
things from this time   
even hidden thin gs which thou hast 
not known   
7they are created now  and not from 
of old   
and before this day thou heardest 
them not   
lest thou shouldest say  behold  i 
knew them   
8yea thou heardest not   
yea thou knewest not   
yea from of old thine ear was not 
opened   
for i knew that thou wouldest deal 
very treacherously   
and wast called a transgressor from 
the womb   
9for my name s sake will i defer 
mine anger   
and for my praise will i refrain for 
thee that i cut thee not off   
10behold  i have refined thee  but 
not as silver   48 isaiah  
634 
 i have tried thee in the furnace of 
affliction   
11for mine own sake  for mine own 
sake will i do it   
for how should it be profaned   
and my glory will i not give to 
another   
 
12hearken unto me  o jacob   
and israel my called   
i am he  i am the first   
i also am the last   
13yea my hand hath laid the 
foundation of the earth   
and my right hand hath spread out 
the heavens   
when i call unto them   
they stand up together   
14assemble yourselves  all ye  and 
hear  
which among them h ath declared 
these things   
he whom the lord loveth shall 
perform his pleasure on babylon   
and show his arm on the 
chaldeans   
15i even i  have spoken  yea i have 
called him   
i have brought him  and he shall 
make his way prosperous   
 
16come ye near un to me  hear ye 
this  
from the beginning i have not 
spoken in secret   
from the time that it was  there am 
i  
and now the lord g od hath sent 
me and his spirit    
17thus saith the lord thy 
redeemer   
the holy one of israel   
i am the lord thy god   
who teacheth thee for thy profit   
who leadeth thee by the way that 
thou shouldest go   
18oh that thou wouldest hearken to 
my commandments   
then would thy peace be as a river   
and thy righteousness as the waves 
of the sea   
19thy seed also would be as the 
sand  
and the offspring of thy body like 
the grains thereof   
his name would not be cut off  
nor destroyed from before me   
 
20go ye forth from babylon   
flee ye from the chaldeans   
with a voice of singing  
declare ye  tell this   
utter it even to the end o f the earth   
say ye  the lord hath redeemed 
his servant jacob   
21and they thirsted not  
when he led them through the 
deserts   
he caused the waters to flow out of 
the rock for them   
he cleaved the rock also  and the 
waters gushed out   
22there is no p eace  
saith the lord concerning the 
wicked   
 isaiah  
635 
 listen  o isles  unto me   
and hearken  ye peoples  from 
  far  
the lord hath called me from the 
womb   
from the bowels of my mother hath 
he made mention of my name   
2and he hath made my mouth like a 
sharp sword   
in the shadow of his hand hath he 
hid me   
and he hath made me a polished 
shaft   
in his quiver hath he concealed me   
3and he said unto me  thou art 
my servant   
israel  in whom i will be glorified   
4but i said  i have laboured in vain   
i have spent my strength for nought 
and vanity   
yet surely my right is with the 
lord  
and my recompense with my god   
5and now saith the lord  
that formed me from the womb to 
be his servant   
to bring jacob back to him   
and that israel be gathered unto 
him 
for i am honourable in the eyes of 
the lord  
and my god is become my 
strength   
6yea he saith  it is too light a 
thing that thou shouldest be my 
servant  
to raise up the tribes of jacob   
and to restore the offspring of 
israel   i will also give thee  for a light of the 
nations   
that my salvation may be unto the 
end of the earth   
 
7thus saith the lord  
the redeemer of israel  his holy 
one  
to him who is despised of men   
to him who is abhorred of nations   
to a servant of rulers   
kings shall see and arise   
princes  and they shall prostrate 
themselves   
because of the lord that is faithful   
even the holy one of israel  who 
hath chosen thee   
 
8thus saith the lord  
in an acceptable time have i 
answered thee   
and in a day of salvation have i 
helped thee   
and i will preserve thee  and give 
thee  
for a covenant of the people   
to raise up the land   
to cause to inherit the desolate 
heritages   
9saying to the prisoners  go forth   
to them that are in darkness  show 
yourselves   
they shall feed i n the ways   
and in all high hills shall be their 
pasture   
10they shall not hunger nor thirst   
neither shall the heat nor sun smite 
them   49 isaiah  
636 
 for he that hath compassion on 
them will lead them   
even by the springs of water will he 
guide them   
11and i will  make all my mountains 
a way   
and my highways shall be raised on 
high  
12behold  these shall come from far   
and lo these from the north and 
from the west   
and these from the land of sinim   
 
13sing o heavens  and be joyful  o 
earth   
and break forth  into singing  o 
mountains   
for the lord hath comforted his 
people   
and hath compassion upon his 
afflicted   
 
14but zion said  the lord hath 
forsaken me   
and the lord hath forgotten me   
15can a woman forget her sucking 
child   
that she should not hav e 
compassion on the son of her 
womb   
yea these may forget   
yet will not i forget thee   
16behold  i have graven thee upon 
the palms of my hands   
thy walls are continually before 
me  
17thy children make haste   thy destroyers and they that made 
thee wa ste shall go forth from 
thee  
18lift up thine eyes round about  and 
behold   
all these gather themselves 
together  and come to thee   
as i live  saith the lord 
thou shalt surely clothe thee with 
them all as with an ornament   
and gird thyself with them  like a 
bride   
19for thy waste and thy desolate 
places  
and thy land that hath been 
destroyed  
surely now shalt thou be too strait 
for the inhabitants   
and they that swallowed thee up 
shall be far away   
20the children of thy bereavement  
shall yet say in  thine ears   
the place is too strait for me   
give place to me that i may dwell   
21then shalt thou say in thy heart   
who hath begotten me these   
seeing i have been bereaved of my 
children  and am solitary   
an exile  and wandering to and fro   
and w ho hath brought up these   
behold  i was left alone   
these where were they   
 
22thus saith the lord g od  
behold  i will lift up my hand to the 
nations   
and set up mine ensign to the 
peoples   isaiah  
637 
 and they shall bring thy sons in 
their bosom   
and thy daug hters shall be carried 
upon their shoulders   
23and kings shall be thy foster 
fathers   
and their queens thy nursing 
mothers   
they shall bow down to thee with 
their face to the earth   
and lick the dust of thy feet   
and thou shalt know that i am the 
lord  
for they shall not be ashamed that 
wait for me   
 
24shall the prey be taken from the 
mighty   
or the captives of the victorious be 
delivered   
25but thus saith the lord  
even the captives of the mighty 
shall be taken away   
and the prey of the terrible  shall be 
delivered   
and i will contend with him that 
contendeth with thee   
and i will save thy children   
26and i will feed them that oppress 
thee with their own flesh   
and they shall be drunken with their 
own blood  as with sweet wine   
and all flesh shall know that i the 
lord am thy saviour   
and thy redeemer  the mighty one 
of jacob   
 
thus saith the lord  
where is the bill of your        mother s divorcement   
wherewith i have put her away   
or which of my creditors is it  
to whom i have sold yo u  
behold  for your iniquities were ye 
sold  
and for your transgressions was 
your mother put away   
2wherefore  when i came  was there 
no man   
when i called  was there none to 
answer   
is my hand shortened at all  that it 
cannot redeem   
or have i no po wer to deliver   
behold  at my rebuke i dry up the 
sea  
i make the rivers a wilderness   
their fish become foul  because 
there is no water   
and die for thirst   
3i clothe the heavens with blackness   
and i make sackcloth their 
covering   
 
4the lord g od hath given me  
the tongue of them that are taught   
that i should know how to sustain 
with words him that is weary   
he wakeneth morning by morning   
he wakeneth mine ear  
to hear as they that are taught   
5the lord g od hath opened mine 
ear  
and i was not rebellious   
neither turned away backward   
6i gave my back to the smiters   
and my checks to them that plucked 
off the hair   50 isaiah  
638 
 i hid not my face from shame and 
spitting   
7for the lord g od will help me   
therefore have i not been 
confounded   
therefore hav e i set my face like a 
flint  
and i know that i shall not be 
ashamed   
8he is near that justifieth me   
who will contend with me  let us 
stand up together   
who is mine adversary  let him 
come near to me   
9behold  the lord g od will help me   
who is he th at shall condemn me   
behold  they all shall wax old as a 
garment   
the moth shall eat them up   
 
10who is among you that feareth the 
lord  
that obeyeth the voice of his 
servant   
though he walketh in darkness   
and hath no light   
let him trust in the na me of the 
lord  
and stay upon his god   
11behold  all ye that kindle a fire   
that gird yourselves with 
firebrands   
begone in the flame of your fire   
and among the brands that ye have 
kindled   
this shall ye have of my hand   
ye shall lie down in sorrow   
 heark en to me  ye that follow 
 after righteousness   
ye that seek the lord  
look unto the rock whence ye were 
hewn   
and to the hole of the pit whence ye 
were digged   
2look unto abraham your father   
and unto sarah that bore you   
for when he was but one i called 
him  
and i blessed him  and made him 
many   
3for the lord hath comforted zion   
he hath comforted all her waste 
places   
and hath made her wilderness like 
eden   
and her desert like the garden of the 
lord  
joy and gladness shall be found  
therein   
thanksgiving  and the voice of 
melody   
 
4attend unto me  o my people   
and give ear unto me  o my nation   
for instruction shall go forth from 
me  
and my right on a sudden for a light 
of the peoples   
5my favour is near   
my salvation is gone forth   
and mine arms shall judge the 
peoples   
the isles shall wait for me   
and on mine arm shall they trust   
6lift up your eyes to the heavens   
and look upon the earth beneath   51 isaiah  
639 
 for the heavens shall vanish away 
like smoke   
and the earth shall wax ol d like a 
garment   
and they that dwell therein shall die 
in like manner   
but my salvation shall be for ever   
and my favour shall not be 
abolished   
 
7hearken unto me  ye that know 
righteousness   
the people in whose heart is my 
law  
fear ye not the taun t of men   
neither be ye dismayed at their 
revilings   
8for the moth shall eat them up like 
a garment   
and the worm shall eat them like 
wool   
but my favour shall be for ever   
and my salvation unto all 
generations   
 
9awake  awake  put on strength   
o arm of the lord  
awake  as in the days of old   
the generations of ancient times   
art thou not it that hewed rahab in 
pieces   
that pierced the dragon   
10art thou not it that dried up the 
sea  
the waters of the great deep   
that made the depths of the se a a 
way  
for the redeemed to pass over   11and the ransomed of the lord 
shall return   
and come with singing unto zion   
and everlasting joy shall be upon 
their heads   
they shall obtain gladness and joy   
and sorrow and sighing shall flee 
away   
 
12i even i am he that comforteth 
you  
who art thou  that thou art afraid of 
man that shall die   
and of the son of man that shall be 
made as grass   
13and hast forgotten the lord thy 
maker   
that stretched forth the heavens   
and laid the foundations of the 
earth  
and fearest continually all the day  
because of the fury of the 
oppressor   
as he maketh ready to destroy   
and where is the fury of the 
oppressor   
14he that is bent down shall speedily 
be loosed   
and he shall not go down dying into 
the pit   
neithe r shall his bread fail   
15for i am the lord thy god   
who stirreth up the sea  that the 
waves thereof roar   
the lord of hosts is his name   
16and i have put my words in thy 
mouth   
and have covered thee in the 
shadow of my hand   isaiah  
640 
 that i may plant the hea vens  
and lay the foundations of the earth   
and say unto zion  thou art my 
people   
 
17awake  awake   
stand up  o jerusalem   
that hast drunk at the hand of the 
lord  
the cup of his fury   
thou hast drunken the beaker  even 
the cup of staggering   
and drained it   
18there is none to guide her  
among all the sons whom she hath 
brought forth   
neither is there any that taketh her 
by the hand  
of all the sons that she hath brought 
up  
19these two things are befallen thee   
who shall bemoan thee   
desolati on and destruction   
and the famine and the sword   
how shall i comfort thee   
20thy sons have fainted  they lie at 
the head of all the streets   
as an antelope in a net   
they are full of the fury of the lord  
the rebuke of thy god   
21therefore hear now  this thou 
afflicted   
and drunken  but not with wine   
22thus saith thy lord the lord  
and thy god that pleadeth the cause 
of his people   
behold  i have taken out of thy hand  
the cup of staggering   the beaker  even the cup of my 
fury  
thou shalt no more drink it again   
23and i will put it into the hand of 
them that afflict thee   
that have said to thy soul   
bow down  that we may go over   
and thou hast laid thy back as the 
ground   
and as the street  to them that go 
over  
 
awake  awake   
put on thy strength  o zion   
put on thy beautiful garments   
o jerusalem  the holy city   
for henceforth there shall no more 
come into thee  
the uncircumcised and the unclean   
2shake thyself from the dust   
arise and sit down  o jerusalem   
loose thyself fr om the bands of thy 
neck   
o captive daughter of zion   
 
3for thus saith the lord  
ye were sold for nought   
and ye shall be redeemed without 
money   
4for thus saith the lord g od  
my people went down aforetime 
into egypt to sojourn there   
and the assyri an oppressed them 
without cause   
5now therefore  what do i here  
saith the lord  
seeing that my people is taken away 
for nought   52 isaiah  
641 
 they that rule over them do howl  
saith the lord  
and my name continually all the 
day is blasphemed   
6therefore my people shall know 
my name   
therefore they shall know in that 
day  
that i even he that spoke  behold  
here i am   
 
7how beautiful upon the mountains  
are the feet of the messenger of 
good tidings   
that announceth peace  the 
harbinger of good tidings   
that anno unceth salvation   
that saith unto zion   
thy god reigneth    
8hark  thy watchmen  they lift up 
the voice   
together do they sing   
for they shall see  eye to eye   
the lord returning to zion   
9break forth into joy  sing together   
ye waste places of je rusalem   
for the lord hath comforted his 
people   
he hath redeemed jerusalem   
10the lord hath made bare his holy 
arm  
in the eyes of all the nations   
and all the ends of the earth shall 
see  
the salvation of our god   
11depart ye  depart ye  go ye out 
from thence   
touch no unclean thing   go ye out of the midst of her  be ye 
clean   
ye that bear the vessels of the lord  
12for ye shall not go out in haste   
neither shall ye go by flight   
for the lord will go before you   
and the god of israel will be y our 
rearward   
 
13behold  my servant shall prosper   
he shall be exalted and lifted up  
and shall be very high   
14according as many were appalled 
at thee  
so marred was his visage unlike that 
of a man   
and his form unlike that of the sons 
of men  
15so sh all he startle many nations   
kings shall shut their mouths 
because of him   
for that which had not been told 
them shall they see   
and that which they had not heard 
shall they perceive   
who would have believed our 
 report   
and to whom hath the arm o f the 
lord been revealed   
2for he shot up right forth as a 
sapling   
and as a root out of a dry ground   
he had no form nor comeliness  that 
we should look upon him   
nor beauty that we should delight in 
him  
3he was despised  and forsaken of 
men  53 isaiah  
642 
 a man of pains  and acquainted with 
disease   
and as one from whom men hide 
their face   
he was despised  and we esteemed 
him not   
4surely our diseases he did bear  and 
our pains he carried   
whereas we did esteem him 
stricken   
smitten of god  and afflicted   
5but he was wounded because of 
our transgressions   
he was crushed because of our 
iniquities   
the chastisement of our welfare was 
upon him   
and with his stripes we were 
healed   
6all we like sheep did go astray   
we turned every one to his own 
way  
and the lord hath made to light on 
him  
the iniquity of us all   
7he was oppressed  though he 
humbled himself  
and opened not his mouth   
as a lamb that is led to the 
slaughter   
and as a sheep that before her 
shearers is dumb   
yea he opened not his mouth   
8by oppression and judgment he 
was taken away   
and with his generation who did 
reason   
for he was cut off out of the land of 
the living   for the transgression of my people 
to whom the stroke was due   
9and they made his grave with the 
wicked   
and with  the rich his tomb   
although he had done no violence   
neither was any deceit in his 
mouth   
 
10yet it pleased the lord to crush 
him by disease   
to see if his soul would offer itself 
in restitution   
that he might see his seed  prolong 
his days   
and th at the purpose of the lord 
might prosper by his hand   
11of the travail of his soul he shall 
see to the full  even my servant   
who by his knowledge did justify 
the righteous one to the many   
and their iniquities he did bear   
12therefore will i divide hi m a 
portion among the great   
and he shall divide the spoil with 
the mighty   
because he bared his soul unto 
death   
and was numbered with the 
transgressors   
yet he bore the sin of many   
and made intercession for the 
transgressors   
 
sing o barren  thou that didst  
 not bear   
break forth into singing  and cry 
aloud  thou that didst not travail   54 isaiah  
643 
 for more are the children of the 
desolate  
than the children of the married 
wife saith the lord  
2enlarge the place of thy tent   
and let them stretch fort h the 
curtains of thy habitations  spare 
not  
lengthen thy cords  and strengthen 
thy stakes   
3for thou shalt spread abroad on the 
right hand and on the left   
and thy seed shall possess the 
nations   
and make the desolate cities to be 
inhabited   
4fear n ot for thou shalt not be 
ashamed   
neither be thou confounded  for 
thou shalt not be put to shame   
for thou shalt forget the shame of 
thy youth   
and the reproach of thy widowhood 
shalt thou remember no more   
5for thy maker is thy husband   
the lord of hosts is his name   
and the holy one of israel is thy 
redeemer   
the god of the whole earth shall he 
be called   
6for the lord hath called thee  
as a wife forsaken and grieved in 
spirit   
and a wife of youth  can she be 
rejected   
saith thy god   
7for a sm all moment have i 
forsaken thee   but with great compassion will i 
gather thee   
8in a little wrath i hid my face from 
thee for a moment   
but with everlasting kindness will i 
have compassion on thee   
saith the lord thy redeemer   
9for this is as the wate rs of noah 
unto me   
for as i have sworn that the waters 
of noah  
should no more go over the earth   
so have i sworn that i would not be 
wroth with thee   
nor rebuke thee   
10for the mountains may depart   
and the hills be removed   
but my kindness shall n ot depart 
from thee   
neither shall my covenant of peace 
be removed   
saith the lord that hath compass 
sion on thee   
 
11o thou afflicted  tossed with 
tempest   
and not comforted   
behold  i will set thy stones in fair 
colours   
and lay thy foundations wit h 
sapphires   
12and i will make thy pinnacles of 
rubies   
and thy gates of carbuncles   
and all thy border of precious 
stones   
13and all thy children shall be 
taught of the lord  isaiah  
644 
 and great shall be the peace of thy 
children   
14in righteousness shalt tho u be 
established   
be thou far from oppression  for 
thou shalt not fear   
and from ruin  for it shall not come 
near thee   
15behold  they may gather together  
but not by me   
whosoever shall gather together 
against thee shall fall because of 
thee  
16behol d i have created the smith  
that bloweth the fire of coals   
and bringeth forth a weapon for his 
work   
and i have created the waster to 
destroy   
17no weapon that is formed against 
thee shall prosper   
and every tongue that shall rise 
against thee in jud gment thou 
shalt condemn   
this is the heritage of the servants 
of the lord  
and their due reward from me  saith 
the lord  
 
ho every one that thirsteth  
 come ye for water   
and he that hath no money   
come ye  buy and eat   
yea come buy wine and milk  
without money and without price   
2wherefore do ye spend money for 
that which is not bread   
and your gain for that which 
satisfieth not   hearken diligently unto me  and eat 
ye that which is good   
and let your soul delight itself in 
fatness   
3incline your ear  and come unto 
me  
hear and your soul shall live   
and i will make an everlasting 
covenant with you   
even the sure mercies of david   
4behold  i have given him for a 
witness to the peoples   
a prince and commander to the 
peoples   
5behold  thou shalt call a nation that 
thou knowest not   
and a nation that knew not thee 
shall run unto thee   
because of the lord thy god   
and for the holy one of israel  for 
he hath glorified thee   
 
6seek ye the lord while he may be 
found   
call ye upon him wh ile he is near   
7let the wicked forsake his way   
and the man of iniquity his 
thoughts   
and let him return unto the lord 
and he will have compassion 
upon him   
and to our god  for he will 
abundantly pardon  
8for my thoughts are not your 
thoughts   
neither are your ways my ways  
saith the lord  
9for as the heavens are higher than 
the earth   55 isaiah  
645 
 so are my ways higher than your 
ways   
and my thoughts than your 
thoughts   
10for as the rain cometh down and 
the snow from heaven   
and returneth not thither   
except it water the earth   
and make it bring forth and bud   
and give seed to the sower and 
bread to the eater   
11so shall my word be that goeth 
forth out of my mouth   
it shall not return unto me void   
except it accomplish that which i 
please   
and make th e thing whereto i sent it 
prosper   
12for ye shall go out with joy   
and be led forth with peace   
the mountains and the hills shall 
break forth before you into 
singing   
and all the trees of the field shall 
clap their hands   
13instead of the thorn shall come up 
the cypress   
and instead of the brier shall come 
up the myrtle   
and it shall be to the lord for a 
memorial   
for an everlasting sign that shall not 
be cut off   
 
thus saith the lord  
keep ye justice  and do    
    righteousness   
for my salva tion is near to come   
and my favour to be revealed   2happy is the man that doeth this   
and the son of man that holdeth fast 
by it  
that keepeth the sabbath from 
profaning it   
and keepeth his hand from doing 
any evil   
3neither let the alien   
that hat h joined himself to the 
lord speak  saying   
the lord will surely separate me 
from his people   
neither let the eunuch say   
behold  i am a dry tree   
4for thus saith the lord  
concerning the eunuchs that keep 
my sabbaths   
and choose the things that please 
me  
and hold fast by my covenant   
5even unto them will i give in my 
house  
and within my walls a monument 
and a memorial  
better than sons and daughters   
i will give them an everlasting 
memorial   
that shall not be cut off   
6also the aliens  that join 
themselves to the lord to 
minister unto him   
and to love the name of the lord  
to be his servants   
every one that keepeth the sabbath 
from profaning it   
and holdeth fast by my covenant   
7even them will i bring to my holy 
mountain   56 isaiah  
646 
 and make th em joyful in my house 
of prayer   
their burnt offerings and their 
sacrifices  
shall be acceptable upon mine altar   
for my house shall be called  
a house of prayer for all peoples   
8saith the lord g od who gathereth 
the dispersed of israel   
yet i will gat her others to him  
beside those of him that are 
gathered   
 
9all ye beasts of the field  come to 
devour   
yea all ye beasts in the forest   
10his watchmen are all blind   
without knowledge   
they are all dumb dogs   
they cannot bark   
raving  lying down  loving to 
slumber   
11yea the dogs are greedy   
they know not when they have 
enough   
and these are shepherds  
that cannot understand   
they all turn to their own way   
each one to his gain  one and all   
12come ye  i will fetch wine   
and we will fill o urselves with 
strong drink   
and to morrow shall be as this day   
and much more abundant   
 
the righteous perisheth   
and no man layeth it to heart   
and godly men are taken away   
none considering  that the righteous is taken away 
from the evil to com e  
2he entereth into peace   
they rest in their beds   
each one that walketh in his 
uprightness   
 
3but draw near hither   
ye sons of the sorceress   
the seed of the adulterer and the 
harlot   
4against whom do ye sport 
yourselves   
against whom make ye a wide 
mouth   
and draw out the tongue   
are ye not children of transgression   
a seed of falsehood   
5ye that inflame yourselves among 
the terebinths   
under every leafy tree   
that slay the children in the valleys   
under the clefts of the rocks   
6among t he smooth stones of the 
valley is thy portion   
they they are thy lot   
even to them hast thou poured a 
drink offering   
thou hast offered a meal offering   
should i pacify myself for these 
things   
7upon a high and lofty mountain  
hast thou set thy bed   
thither also wentest thou up  
to offer sacrifice   
8and behind the doors and the posts  
hast thou set up thy symbol   
for thou hast uncovered  and art 
gone up from me   57 isaiah  
647 
 thou hast enlarged thy bed   
and chosen thee of them  
whose bed thou lovedst   
whose h and thou sawest   
9and thou wentest to the king with 
ointment   
and didst increase thy perfumes   
and didst send thine ambassadors 
far off   
even down to the nether world   
10thou wast wearied with the length 
of thy way  yet saidst thou not  
there is no h ope thou didst find 
a renewal of thy strength  
therefore thou wast not affected   
11and of whom hast thou been 
afraid and in fear  that thou 
wouldest fail  and as for me  
thou hast not remembered me  
nor laid it to thy heart  have not i 
held my peace eve n of long time  
therefore thou fearest me not   
12i will declare thy righteousness  
thy works also they shall not 
profit thee   
13when thou criest  let them that 
thou hast gathered deliver thee  
but the wind shall carry them all 
away  a breath shall bear t hem 
off but he that taketh refuge in 
me shall possess the land  and 
shall inherit my holy mountain   
 
14and he will say   
cast ye up  cast ye up  clear the 
way  
take up the stumblingblock out of 
the way of my people   15for thus saith the high and lofty 
one  
that inhabiteth eternity  whose 
name is holy   
i dwell in the high and holy place   
with him also that is of a contrite 
and humble spirit   
to revive the spirit of the humble   
and to revive the heart of the 
contrite ones   
16for i will not contend fo r ever   
neither will i be always wroth   
for the spirit that enwrappeth itself 
is from me   
and the souls which i have made   
17for the iniquity of his 
covetousness was i wroth and 
smote him   
i hid me and was wroth   
and he went on frowardly in the 
way o f his heart   
18i have seen his ways  and will heal 
him  
i will lead him also  and requite with 
comforts him and his mourners   
19peace  peace  to him that is far off 
and to him that is near   
saith the lord that createth the fruit 
of the lips   
and i wil l heal him   
20but the wicked are like the 
troubled sea   
for it cannot rest  and its waters cast 
up mire and dirt   
21there is no peace   
saith my god concerning the 
wicked   
 isaiah  
648 
 cry aloud  spare not   
lift up thy voice like a horn   
and declare unto my p eople their 
transgression   
and to the house of jacob their sins   
2yet they seek me daily   
and delight to know my ways   
as a nation that did righteousness   
and forsook not the ordinance of 
their god   
they ask of me righteous 
ordinances   
they delight to draw near unto god   
 
3wherefore have we fasted  and 
thou seest not   
wherefore have we afflicted our 
soul and thou takest no 
knowledge   
behold  in the day of your fast ye 
pursue your business   
and exact all your labours   
4behold  ye fast for str ife and 
contention   
and to smite with the fist of 
wickedness   
ye fast not this day  
so as to make your voice to be 
heard on high   
5is such the fast that i have chosen   
the day for a man to afflict his 
soul  
is it to bow down his head as a 
bulrush   
and to spread sackcloth and ashes 
under him   
wilt thou call this a fast   
and an acceptable day to the lord  6is not this the fast that i have 
chosen   
to loose the fetters of wickedness   
to undo the bands of the yoke   
and to let the oppressed go free   
and that ye break every yoke   
7is it not to deal thy bread to the 
hungry   
and that thou bring the poor that are 
cast out to thy house   
when thou seest the naked  that 
thou cover him   
and that thou hide not thyself from 
thine own flesh   
8then shall thy  light break forth as 
the morning   
and thy healing shall spring forth 
speedily   
and thy righteousness shall go 
before thee   
the glory of the lord shall be thy 
rearward   
9then shalt thou call  and the lord 
will answer   
thou shalt cry  and he will say  
here i am   
if thou take away from the midst of 
thee the yoke   
the putting forth of the finger  and 
speaking wickedness   
10and if thou draw out thy soul to 
the hungry   
and satisfy the afflicted soul   
then shall thy light rise in darkness   
and thy gl oom be as the noon day  
11and the lord will guide thee 
continually   
and satisfy thy soul in drought   
and make strong thy bones   58 isaiah  
649 
 and thou shalt be like a watered 
garden   
and like a spring of water  whose 
waters fail not   
12and they that shall be of th ee shall 
build the old waste places   thou shalt raise up the foundations 
of many generations   
and thou shalt be called the 
repairer of the breach   
the restorer of paths to dwell in   
13if thou turn away thy foot because 
of the sabbath   
from pursuing t hy business on my 
holy day   
and call the sabbath a delight   
and the holy of the lord 
honourable   
and shalt honour it  not doing thy 
wonted ways   
nor pursuing thy business  nor 
speaking thereof   
14then shalt thou delight thyself in 
the lord  
and i wil l make thee to ride upon 
the high places of the earth   
and i will feed thee with the 
heritage of jacob thy father   
for the mouth of the lord hath 
spoken it   
 
behold  the l ords  hand is 
 not shortened  that it cannot 
     save  
neither his ear heavy  that it cannot 
hear  
2but your iniquities have separated  
between you and your god   
and your sins have hid his face 
from you   
that he will not hear   
3for your hands are defiled with 
blood   and your fingers with iniquity   
your lips have spoken lies   
your tongue muttereth wickedness   
4none sueth in righteousness   
and none pleadeth in truth   
they trust in vanity  and speak lies   
they conceive mischief  and bring 
forth iniquity   
5they hatch basilisks eggs  
and weave the spider s web   
he that eate th of their eggs dieth  
and that which is crushed breaketh 
out into a viper   
6their webs shall not become 
garments   
neither shall men cover themselves 
with their works   
their works are works of iniquity   
and the act of violence is in their 
hands   
7their feet run to evil   
and they make haste to shed 
innocent blood   
their thoughts are thoughts of 
iniquity   
desolation and destruction are in 
their paths   
8the way of peace they know not   
and there is no right in their goings   
they have made them croo ked 
paths   
whosoever goeth therein doth not 
know peace   59 isaiah  
650 
  
9therefore is justice far from us   
neither doth righteousness overtake 
us  
we look for light  but behold 
darkness   
for brightness  but we walk in 
gloom   
10we grope for the wall like the 
blind   
yea as they that have no eyes do 
we grope   
we stumble at noonday as in the 
twilight   
we are in dark places like the dead   
11we all growl like bears   
and mourn sore like doves   
we look for right  but there is none   
for salvation  but it is far off f rom 
us  
 
12for our transgressions are 
multiplied before thee   
and our sins testify against us   
for our transgressions are present to 
us  
and as for our iniquities  we know 
them   
13transgressing and denying the 
lord  
and turning away from following 
our god   
speaking oppression and 
perverseness   
conceiving and uttering from the 
heart words of falsehood   
14and justice is turned away 
backward   
and righteousness standeth afar off   for truth hath stumbled in the broad 
place   
and uprightness cannot ent er  
15and truth is lacking   
and he that departeth from evil 
maketh himself a prey   
 
and the lord saw it  and it 
displeased him  
that there was no justice   
16and he saw that there was no 
man  
and was astonished that there was 
no intercessor   
therefore  his own arm brought 
salvation unto him   
and his righteousness  it sustained 
him  
17and he put on righteousness as a 
coat of mail   
and a helmet of salvation upon his 
head   
and he put on garments of 
vengeance for clothing   
and was clad with zeal as a c loak  
18according to their deeds  
accordingly he will repay   
fury to his adversaries  recompense 
to his enemies   
to the islands he will repay 
recompense   
19so shall they fear the name of the 
lord from the west   
and his glory from the rising of the 
sun  
for distress will come in like a 
flood   
which the breath of the lord 
driveth   isaiah  
651 
  
20and a redeemer will come to zion   
and unto them that turn from 
transgression in jacob   
saith the lord  
21and as for me  this is my covenant 
with them  saith the lord my spirit 
that is upon thee  and my words which 
i have put in thy mouth  shall not 
depart out of thy mouth  nor out of the 
mouth of thy seed  nor out of the 
mouth of thy seed s seed  saith the 
lord from henceforth and for ever   
 
arise  shine  for thy light  is 
 come   
and the glory of the lord is risen 
upon thee   
2for behold  darkness shall cover 
the earth   
and gross darkness the peoples   
but upon thee the lord will arise   
and his glory shall be seen upon 
thee  
3and nations shall walk at thy ligh t  
and kings at the brightness of thy 
rising   
 
4lift up thine eyes round about  and 
see  
they all are gathered together  and 
come to thee   
thy sons come from far   
and thy daughters are borne on the 
side  
5then thou shalt see and be radiant   
and thy heart shall throb and be 
enlarged   because the abundance of the sea 
shall be turned unto thee   
the wealth of the nations shall come 
unto thee   
6the caravan of camels shall cover 
thee  
and of the young camels of midian 
and ephah   
all coming from sheba   
they shall bring gold and incense   
and shall proclaim the praises of the 
lord  
7all the flocks of kedar shall be 
gathered together unto thee   
the rams of nebaioth shall minister 
unto thee   
they shall come up with acceptance 
on mine altar   
and i will  glorify my glorious 
house   
 
8who are these that fly as a cloud   
and as the doves to their cotes   
9surely the isles shall wait for me   
and the ships of tarshish first   
to bring thy sons from far   
their silver and their gold with 
them   
for the name o f the lord thy god   
and for the holy one of israel  
because he hath glorified thee   
 
10and aliens shall build up thy 
walls   
and their kings shall minister unto 
thee  
for in my wrath i smote thee   
but in my favour have i had 
compassion on thee   60 isaiah  
652 
 11thy gates also shall be open 
continually   
day and night  they shall not be 
shut  
that men may bring unto thee the 
wealth of the nations   
and their kings in procession   
12for that nation and kingdom that 
will not serve thee shall perish   
yea those nations  shall be utterly 
wasted   
 
13the glory of lebanon shall come 
unto thee   
the cypress  the plane tree and the 
larch together   
to beautify the place of my 
sanctuary   
and i will make the place of my 
feet glorious   
14and the sons of them that afflicted 
thee  
shall come bending unto thee   
and all they that despised thee shall 
bow down  
at the soles of thy feet   
and they shall call thee the city of 
the lord  
the zion of the holy one of israel   
 
15whereas thou hast been forsaken 
and hated   
so that no man passed through thee   
i will make thee an eternal 
excellency   
a joy of many generations   
16thou shalt also suck the milk of 
the nations   
and shalt suck the breast of kings   and thou shalt know that i the lord 
am thy saviour   
and i the mighty one of j acob  thy 
redeemer   
 
17for brass i will bring gold   
and for iron i will bring silver   
and for wood brass   
and for stones iron   
i will also make thy officers peace   
and righteousness thy magistrates   
18violence shall no more be heard in 
thy land   
desolation nor destruction within 
thy borders   
but thou shalt call thy walls 
salvation   
and thy gates praise   
 
19the sun shall be no more thy light 
by day   
neither for brightness shall the 
moon give light unto thee   
but the lord shall be unto thee an 
everlasting light   
and thy god thy glory   
20thy sun shall no more go down   
neither shall thy moon withdraw 
itself   
for the lord shall be thine 
everlasting light   
and the days of thy mourning shall 
be ended   
 
21thy people also shall be all 
righteous   
they shall inherit the land for ever   
the branch of my planting  the 
work of my hands   isaiah  
653 
 wherein i glory   
22the smallest shall become a 
thousand   
and the least a mighty nation   
i the lord will hasten it in its time   
 
the spirit of the lord g od  is 
 upon me   
because the lord hath anointed me  
to bring good tidings unto the 
humble   
he hath sent me to bind up the 
broken hearted   
to proclaim liberty to the captives   
and the opening of the eyes to them 
that are bound   
2to proclaim the year of the l ords 
good pleasure   
and the day of vengeance of our 
god  
to comfort all that mourn   
3to appoint unto them that mourn in 
zion   
to give unto them a garland for 
ashes   
the oil of joy for mourning   
the mantle of praise for the spirit of 
heaviness   
that th ey might be called terebinths 
of righteousness   
the planting of the lord wherein 
he might glory   
4and they shall build the old wastes   
they shall raise up the former 
desolations   
and they shall renew the waste 
cities   
the desolations of many 
generati ons  5and strangers shall stand and feed 
your flocks   
and aliens shall be your plowmen 
and your vinedressers   
6but ye shall be named the priests of 
the lord  
men shall call you the ministers of 
our god   
ye shall eat the wealth of the 
nations   
and in their splendour shall ye 
revel   
7for your shame which was double   
and for that they rejoiced  
confusion is their portion   
therefore in their land they shall 
possess double   
everlasting joy shall be unto them   
 
8for i the lord love justice   
i hate r obbery with iniquity   
and i will give them their 
recompense in truth   
and i will make an everlasting 
covenant with them   
9and their seed shall be known 
among the nations   
and their offspring among the 
peoples   
all that see them shall acknowledge 
them   
that they are the seed which the 
lord hath blessed   
 
10i will greatly rejoice in the lord  
my soul shall be joyful in my god   
for he hath clothed me with the 
garments of salvation   61 isaiah  
654 
 he hath covered me with the robe of 
victory   
as a bridegroom putteth  on a 
priestly diadem   
and as a bride adorneth herself with 
her jewels   
11for as the earth bringeth forth her 
growth   
and as the garden causeth the things 
that are sown in it to spring forth   
so the lord g od will cause victory 
and glory  
to spring fort h before all the 
nations   
 
for zion s sake will i not 
 hold my peace   
and for jerusalem s sake i will not 
rest  
until her triumph go forth as 
brightness   
and her salvation as a torch that 
burneth   
2and the nations shall see thy 
triumph   
and all ki ngs thy glory   
and thou shalt be called by a new 
name   
which the mouth of the lord shall 
mark out   
3thou shalt also be a crown of 
beauty in the hand of the lord  
and a royal diadem in the open 
hand of thy god   
4thou shalt no more be termed 
forsaken   
neither shall thy land any more be 
termed desolate   but thou shalt be called  my delight 
is in her   
and thy land  espoused   
for the lord delighteth in thee   
and thy land shall be espoused   
5for as a young man espouseth a 
virgin   
so shall thy sons esp ouse thee   
and as the bridegroom rejoiceth 
over the bride   
so shall thy god rejoice over thee   
 
6i have set watchmen  
upon thy walls  o jerusalem   
they shall never hold their peace  
day nor night   
ye that are the l ords 
remembrancers   
take ye no res t  
7and give him no rest   
till he establish   
and till he make jerusalem  
a praise in the earth   
8the lord hath sworn by his right 
hand   
and by the arm of his strength   
surely i will no more give thy corn  
to be food for thine enemies   
and strangers  shall not drink thy 
wine   
for which thou hast laboured   
9but they that have garnered it shall 
eat it   
and praise the lord  
and they that have gathered it shall 
drink it  
in the courts of my sanctuary   
 
10go through  go through the gates   62 isaiah  
655 
 clear ye th e way of the people   
cast up  cast up the highway   
gather out the stones   
lift up an ensign over the peoples   
11behold  the lord hath proclaimed   
unto the end of the earth   
say ye to the daughter of zion   
behold  thy salvation cometh   
behold  his r eward is with him   
and his recompense before him   
12and they shall call them the holy 
people   
the redeemed of the lord  
and thou shalt be called sought out   
a city not forsaken   
 
who is this that cometh from 
 edom   
with crimsoned garments from 
bozrah   
this that is glorious in his apparel   
stately in the greatness of his 
strength  
i that speak in victory  mighty to 
save  
2wherefore is thine apparel red   
and thy garments like his that 
treadeth in the winevat   
3i have trodden the wine press 
alone   
and of the peoples there was no 
man with me   
yea i trod them in mine anger   
and trampled them in my fury   
and their lifeblood is dashed against 
my garments   
and i have stained all my raiment   
4for the day of vengeance that was 
in my hea rt  and my year of redemption are 
come   
5and i looked  and there was none 
to help   
and i beheld in astonishment  and 
there was none to uphold   
therefore mine own arm brought 
salvation unto me   
and my fury  it upheld me   
6and i trod down the peoples i n 
mine anger   
and made them drunk with my 
fury  
and i poured out their lifeblood on 
the earth   
 
7i will make mention of the mercies 
of the lord  
and the praises of the lord  
according to all that the lord hath 
bestowed on us   
and the great goodness toward the 
house of israel   
which he hath bestowed on them 
according to his compassions   
and according to the multitude of 
his mercies   
8for he said  surely  they are my 
people   
children that will not deal falsely   
so he was their saviour   
9in all their affliction he was 
afflicted   
and the angel of his presence saved 
them   
in his love and in his pity he 
redeemed them   
and he bore them  and carried them 
all the days of old   63 isaiah  
656 
 10but they rebelled  and grieved his 
holy spirit   
therefore he was turne d to be their 
enemy   
himself fought against them   
11then his people remembered the 
days of old  the days of moses   
where is he that brought them up 
out of the sea  
with the shepherds of his flock   
where is he that put his holy spirit  
in the midst of them   
12that caused his glorious arm to go 
at the right hand of moses   
that divided the water before them   
to make himself an everlasting 
name   
13that led them through the deep   
as a horse in the wilderness  
without stumbling   
14as the cattle that go  down into the 
valley   
the spirit of the lord caused them 
to rest   
so didst thou lead thy people   
to make thyself a glorious name   
 
15look down from heaven  and see   
even from thy holy and glorious 
habitation   
where is thy zeal and thy mighty 
acts  
the yearning of thy heart and thy 
compassions   
now restrained toward me   
16for thou art our father   
for abraham knoweth us not   
and israel doth not acknowledge us   
thou  o lord art our father   our redeemer from everlasting is 
thy name   
17o lord why dost thou make us to 
err from thy ways   
and hardenest our heart from thy 
fear  
return for thy servants sake  
the tribes of thine inheritance   
18thy holy people they have well 
nigh driven out   
our adversaries have trodden down 
thy sanctuary   
19we a re become as they over whom 
thou never borest rule   
as they that were not called by thy 
name   
 
oh that thou wouldest rend the 
heavens  that thou wouldest 
come down   
that the mountains might quake at 
thy presence   
as when fire kindleth the 
 brush wood  
and the fire causeth the waters to 
boil  
to make thy name known to thine 
adversaries   
that the nations might  tremble at 
thy presence   
2when thou didst tremendous 
things  
which we looked not for  
oh that thou wouldest come down  
that the mountains m ight quake at 
thy presence   
3and whereof from of old men have 
not heard  nor perceived by the 
ear  64 isaiah  
657 
 neither hath the eye seen a god 
beside thee   
who worketh for him that waiteth 
for him   
 
4thou didst take away him that 
joyfully worked righteousness   
those that remembered thee in thy 
ways  
behold  thou wast wroth  and we 
sinned  
upon them have we stayed of old  
that we might be saved   
5and we are all become as one that 
is unclean   
and all our righteousnesses are as a 
polluted garment   
and we all do f ade as a leaf   
and our iniquities  like the wind  
take us away   
6and there is none that calleth upon 
thy name   
that stirreth up himself to take hold 
of thee   
for thou hast hid thy face from us   
and hast consumed us by means of 
our iniquities   
 
7but n ow o lord thou art our 
father   
we are the clay  and thou our 
potter   
and we all are the work of thy 
hand   
8be not wroth very sore  o lord  
neither remember iniquity for ever   
behold  look we beseech thee  we 
are all thy people   9thy holy cities ar e become a 
wilderness   
zion is become a wilderness   
jerusalem a desolation   
10our holy and our beautiful house   
where our fathers praised thee   
is burned with fire   
and all our pleasant things are laid 
waste   
11wilt thou refrain thyself for these 
things o lord  
wilt thou hold thy peace  and 
afflict us very sore   
i gave access to them that 
 asked  not for me   
i was at hand to them that sought 
me not   
i said  behold me  behold me   
unto a nation that was not called 
by my name   
2i have spread out my hands all the 
day  
unto a rebellious people   
that walk in a way that is not good   
after their own thoughts   
3a people that provoke me  
to my face continually   
that sacrifice in gardens   
and burn incense upon bricks   
4that sit among the graves   
and lodge in the vaults   
that eat swine s flesh   
and broth of abominable things is in 
their vessels   
5that say  stand by thyself   
come not near to me  for i am holier 
than thou   
these are a smoke in my nose   
a fire that burneth all the day   65 isaiah  
658 
 6behold it is written before me   
i will not keep silence  except i have 
requited   
yea i will requite into their bosom   
7your own iniquities  and the 
iniquities of your fathers together   
saith the lord that have offered 
upon the mountains   
and blaspheme d me upon the hills   
therefore will i first measure their 
wage into their bosom   
 
8thus saith the lord  
as when wine is found in the 
cluster   
one saith  destroy it not   
for a blessing is in it   
so will i do for my servants  sakes   
that i may not destroy all   
9and i will bring forth a seed out of 
jacob   
and out of judah an inheritor of my 
mountains   
and mine elect shall inherit it   
and my servants shall dwell there   
10and sharon shall be a fold of 
flocks   
and the valley of achor a place for 
herds to lie down in   
for my people that have sought me   
11but ye that forsake the lord  
that forget my holy mountain   
that prepare a table for fortune   
and that offer mingled wine in full 
measure unto destiny   
12i will destine you to the sword   
and ye shall all bow down to the 
slaughter   because when i called  ye did not 
answer   
ehen i spoke  ye did not hear   
but ye did that which was evil in 
mine eyes   
and chose that wherein i delighted 
not  
 
13therefore thus saith the lord g od  
behold  my ser vants shall eat   
but ye shall be hungry   
behold  my servants shall drink   
but ye shall be thirsty   
behold  my servants shall rejoice   
but ye shall be ashamed   
14behold  my servants shall sing  
for joy of heart   
but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart   
and shall wail for vexation of spirit   
15and ye shall leave your name for a 
curse unto mine elect   
so may the lord g od slay thee   
but he shall call his servants by 
another name   
16so that he who blesseth himself in 
the earth  
shall bless himself by the god of 
truth   
and he that sweareth in the earth  
shall swear by the god of truth   
because the former troubles are 
forgotten   
and because they are hid from mine 
eyes  
17for behold  i create new heavens  
and a new earth   
and the former things shall  not be 
remembered   
nor come into mind   isaiah  
659 
 18but be ye glad and rejoice for ever  
in that which i create   
for behold  i create jerusalem a 
rejoicing   
and her people a joy   
19and i will rejoice in jerusalem   
and joy in my people   
and the voice of weepi ng shall be 
no more heard in her   
nor the voice of crying   
20there shall be no more thence an 
infant of days  nor an old man   
that hath not filled his days   
for the youngest shall die a hundred 
years old   
and the sinner being a hundred 
years old shall  be accursed   
21and they shall build houses  and 
inhabit them   
and they shall plant vineyards  and 
eat the fruit of them   
22they shall not build  and another 
inhabit   
they shall not plant  and another 
eat  
for as the days of a tree shall be the 
days o f my people   
and mine elect shall long enjoy the 
work of their hands   
23they shall not labour in vain   
nor bring forth for terror   
for they are the seed blessed of the 
lord  
and their offspring with them   
24and it shall come to pass that  
before they  call i will answer   
and while they are yet speaking  i 
will hear   25the wolf and the lamb shall feed 
together   
and the lion shall eat straw like the 
ox  
and dust shall be the serpent s food   
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all 
my holy mountain   
saith the lord  
 
thus saith the lord  
the heaven is my throne   
and the earth is my footstool   
where is the house that ye may 
build unto me   
and where is the place that may be 
my resting place   
2for all these things hath my hand 
made   
and so all t hese things came to be   
saith the lord  
but on this man will i look   
even on him that is poor and of a 
contrite spirit   
and trembleth at my word   
3he that killeth an ox is as if he slew 
a man   
he that sacrificeth a lamb  as if he 
broke a dog s neck   
he that offereth a meal offering  as 
if he offered swine s blood   
he that maketh a memorial offering 
of frankincense  as if he blessed 
an idol   
according as they have chosen their 
own ways   
and their soul delighteth in their 
abominations   
4even so i w ill choose their 
mockings   66 isaiah  
660 
 and will bring their fears upon 
them   
because when i called  none did 
answer   
when i spoke  they did not hear   
but they did that which was evil in 
mine eyes   
and chose that in which i delighted 
not  
 
5hear the word of the lord  
ye that tremble at his word   
your brethren that hate you  that 
cast you out for my name s sake  
have said   
let the lord be glorified   
that we may gaze upon your joy   
but they shall be ashamed   
6hark  an uproar from the city   
hark  it cometh f rom the temple   
hark  the lord rendereth 
recompense to his enemies   
7before she travailed  she brought 
forth   
before her pain came   
she was delivered of a man child   
8who hath heard such a thing   
who hath seen such things   
is a land born in one day   
is a nation brought forth at once   
for as soon as zion travailed   
she brought forth her children   
9shall i bring to the birth  and not 
cause to bring forth   
saith the lord  
shall i that cause to bring forth shut 
the womb   
saith thy god   
 10rejoice  ye with jerusalem   
and be glad with her  all ye that 
love her   
rejoice for joy with her   
all ye that mourn for her   
11that ye may suck  and be satisfied  
with the breast of her consolations   
that ye may drink deeply with 
delight  
of the abundance of her glory   
12for thus saith the lord  
behold  i will extend peace to her 
like a river   
and the wealth of the nations like 
an overflowing stream   
and ye shall suck thereof   
ye shall be borne upon the side   
and shall be dandled upon the 
knees   
13as on e whom his mother 
comforteth   
so will i comfort you   
and ye shall be comforted in 
jerusalem   
14and when ye see this  your heart 
shall rejoice   
and your bones shall flourish like 
young grass   
and the hand of the lord shall be 
known toward his servants   
and he will have indignation 
against his enemies   
 
15for behold  the lord will come in 
fire  
and his chariots shall be like the 
whirlwind   
to render his anger with fury   
and his rebuke with flames of fire   isaiah  
661 
 16for by fire will the lord contend   
and by his sword with all flesh   
and the slain of the lord shall be 
many   
17they that sanctify themselves and 
purify themselves  
to go unto the gardens   
behind one in the midst   
eating swine s flesh  and the 
detestable thing  and the mouse   
shall be consu med together  saith 
the lord  
18for i know  their works and their 
thoughts  the time  cometh  that i will 
gather all nations and tongues  and 
they shall come  and shall see my 
glory  19and i will work a sign among 
them  and i will send such as escape of  
them unto the nations  to tarshish  pul 
and lud  that draw the bow  to tubal 
and javan  to the isles afar off  that 
have not heard my fame  neither have 
seen my glory  and they shall declare 
my glory among the nations  20and 
they shall bring all your bret hren out 
of all the nations for an offering unto 
the lord upon horses  and in chariots  
and in fitters  and upon mules  and 
upon swift beasts  to my holy mountain jerusalem  saith the lord as 
the children of israel bring their 
offering in a clean vessel into the 
house of the lord 21and of them also 
will i take for the priests and for the 
levites  saith the lord 22for as the 
new heavens and the new earth  which 
i will make  shall remain before me  
saith the lord so shall your seed and 
your name remain   
23and it shall come to pass   
that from one new moon to another   
and from one sabbath to another   
shall all flesh come to worship 
before me   
saith the lord  
24and they shall go forth  and look  
upon the carcasses of the men that 
have rebelled against me  
for their worm shall not die   
neither shall their fire be quenched   
and they shall be an abhorring unto 
all flesh   
 
and it shall come to pass  
that from one new moon to another  
and from one sabbath to another  
shall all flesh come to worship befor e me

jeremiah  
 
the word s of jeremiah the son of 
hilkiah  of the priests that were in 
anathoth in the land of benjamin  2to 
whom the word of the lord came in 
the days of josiah the son of amon  
king of judah  in the thirteenth ye ar of 
his reign  3it came also in the days of 
jehoiakim the son of josiah  king of 
judah  unto the end of the eleventh 
year of zedekiah the son of josiah  
king of judah  unto the carrying away 
of jerusalem captive in the fifth 
month   
4and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying   
5before i formed thee in the belly i 
knew thee   
and before thou camest forth out of 
the womb i sanctified thee   
i have appointed thee a prophet 
unto the nations   
6then said i  ah lord g od behold  i 
cannot speak  for i am a  child  7but 
the lord said unto me   
say not  i am a child   
for to whomsoever i shall send thee 
thou shalt go   
and whatsoever i shall command 
thee thou shalt speak   
8be not afraid of them   
for i am with thee to deliver thee   
saith the lord  9then th e lord put forth his hand  and 
touched my mouth  and the lord said 
unto me   
behold  i have put my words in thy 
mouth   
10see i have this day set thee over 
the nations and over the 
kingdoms   
to root out and to pull down   
and to destroy and to overthrow   
to build  and to plant   
 
11moreover the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  jeremiah  what 
seest thou  and i said  i see a rod of 
an aalmond tree 12then said the lord 
unto me  thou hast well seen  for i 
bwatch over my word to perform it   
13and the word of the lord came 
unto me the second time  saying  
what seest thou  and i said  i see a 
seething pot  and the face thereof is 
from the north  14then the lord said 
unto me  out of the north the evil 
shall break forth upon all the 
inhabitants of the land  15for lo i will 
call all the families of the kingdoms of 
the north  saith the lord and they 
shall come  and they shall set every 
one his throne at the entrance of the 
gates of jerusalem  and against all the 
                                                      
a heb shaked  
b heb shoked  1 jeremiah  
663 
 walls thereof round about  and ag ainst 
all the cities of judah  16and i will 
utter my judgments against them 
touching all their wickedness  in that 
they have forsaken me  and have 
offered unto other gods  and 
worshipped the work of their own 
hands  17thou therefore gird up thy 
loins  and arise  and speak unto them 
all that i command thee  be not 
dismayed at them  lest i dismay thee 
before them  18for behold  i have 
made thee this day a fortified city  and 
an iron pillar  and brazen walls  
against the whole land  against the 
kings of judah  against the princes 
thereof  against the priests thereof  and 
against the people of the land  19and 
they shall fight against thee  but they 
shall not prevail against thee  for i am 
with thee  saith the lord to deliver 
thee  
 
and the word of the lord came to 
me saying  2go and cry in the 
ears of jerusalem  saying  thus saith 
the lord  
i remember for thee the affection of 
thy youth   
the love of thine espousals   
how thou wentest after me in the 
wilderness   
in a land that was not sown   
3israel is the l ords hallowed 
portion   
his first fruits of the increase   
all that devour him shall be held 
guilty   evil shall come upon them  saith the 
lord  
 
4hear ye the word of the lord o 
house of jacob   
and all the families of the house of 
israel   
5thus s aith the lord  
what unrighteousness have your 
fathers found in me   
that they are gone far from me   
and have walked after things of 
nought  and are become nought   
6neither said they   
where is the lord that brought us 
up  
out of the land of egypt   
that led us through the wilderness   
through a land of deserts and of 
pits  
through a land of drought and of 
the shadow of death   
through a land that no man passed 
through   
and where no man dwelt   
7and i brought you into a land of 
fruitful fields  to eat  the fruit 
thereof and the good thereof  but 
when ye entered  ye defiled my 
land and made my heritage an 
abomination   
8the priests said not  where is the 
lord  
and they that handle the law knew 
me not   
and the rulers transgressed against 
me  
the pro phets also prophesied by 
baal  2 jeremiah  
664 
 and walked after things that do not 
profit   
9wherefore i will yet plead with 
you saith the lord  
and with your children s children 
will i plead   
10for pass over to the isles of the 
kittites  and see   
and send unto kedar  and consider 
diligently   
and see if there hath been such a 
thing   
11hath a nation changed its gods   
which yet are no gods   
but my people hath changed its 
glory  
for that which doth not profit   
12be astonished  o ye heavens  at 
this  
and be horribly  afraid  be ye 
exceeding amazed   
saith the lord  
13for my people have committed 
two evils   
they have forsaken me  the 
fountain of living waters   
and hewed them out cisterns  
broken cisterns   
that can hold no water   
 
14is israel a servant   
is he a ho meborn slave   
why is he become a prey   
15the young lions have roared upon 
him  
and let their voice resound   
and they have made his land 
desolate   
his cities are laid waste   without inhabitant   
16the children also of noph and 
tahpanhes  
feed upon th e crown of thy head   
17is it not this that doth cause it unto 
thee  
that thou hast forsaken the lord thy 
god  
when he led thee by the way   
 
18and now what hast thou to do in 
the way to egypt   
to drink the waters of shihor   
or what hast thou to do in the way 
to assyria   
to drink the waters of the river   
19thine own wickedness shall 
correct thee   
and thy backslidings shall reprove 
thee  
know therefore and see that it is an 
evil and a bitter thing   
that thou hast forsaken the lord thy 
god  
neither is my fear in thee   
saith the lord g od of hosts   
 
20for of old time i have broken thy 
yoke   
and burst thy bands   
and thou saidst  i will not 
transgress   
upon every high hill  
and under every leafy tree  
thou didst recline  playing the 
harlot   
21yet i had planted thee a noble 
vine  
wholly a right seed   jeremiah  
665 
 how then art thou turned into the 
degenerate plant  
of a strange vine unto me   
22for though thou wash thee with 
nitre  
and take thee much soap   
yet thine iniquity is marked before 
me  
saith the lord g od  
 
23how canst thou say  i am not 
defiled   
i have not gone after the baalim   
see thy way in the valley   
know what thou hast done   
thou art a swift young camel 
traversing her ways   
24a wild ass used to the wilderness   
that snuffeth up the wi nd in her 
desire   
her lust  who can hinder it   
all they that seek her will not weary 
themselves   
in her month they shall find her   
25withhold thy foot from being 
unshod   
and thy throat from thirst   
but thou saidst  there is no hope   
no for i have loved strangers  and 
after them will i go   
 
26as the thief is ashamed when he is 
found   
so is the house of israel ashamed   
they their kings  their princes   
and their priests  and their prophets   
27who say to a stock  thou art my 
father   and to a stone  thou hast brought 
us forth   
for they have turned their back unto 
me and not their face   
but in the time of their trouble they 
will say   
arise  and save us   
28but where are thy gods that thou 
hast made thee   
let them arise  if they can save  thee 
in the time of thy trouble   
for according to the number of thy 
cities  
are thy gods  o judah   
 
29wherefore will ye contend with 
me  
ye all have transgressed against me   
saith the lord  
30in vain have i smitten your 
children  
they received no cor rection   
your sword hath devoured your 
prophets   
like a destroying lion   
31o generation  see ye the word of 
the lord  
have i been a wilderness unto 
israel   
or a land of thick darkness   
wherefore say my people  we 
roam at large   
we will come no more  unto thee   
32can a maid forget her ornaments   
or a bride her attire   
yet my people have forgotten me  
days without number   
 
33how trimmest thou thy way  jeremiah  
666 
 to seek love   
therefore even the wicked women  
hast thou taught thy ways   
34also in thy skirts is found the 
blood  
of the souls of the innocent poor   
thou didst not find them breaking 
in  
yet for all these things  
35thou saidst  i am innocent   
surely his anger is turned away 
from me  
behold  i will enter into judgment 
with thee   
because thou s ayest  i have not 
sinned   
 
36how greatly dost thou cheapen 
thyself  
to change thy way   
thou shalt be ashamed of egypt 
also  
as thou wast ashamed of asshur   
37from him also shalt thou go forth   
with thy hands upon thy head   
for the lord hath rejecte d them in 
whom thou didst trust   
and thou shalt not prosper in them   
 
       saying   
if a man put away his wife   
and she go from him   
and become another man s  
may he return unto her again   
will not that land be greatly 
polluted   
but thou hast  played the harlot with 
many lovers   and wouldest thou yet return to 
me  
saith the lord  
2lift up thine eyes unto the high 
hills and see   
where hast thou not been lain with   
by the ways hast thou sat for them   
as an arabian in the wilderness   
and thou hast polluted the land  
with thy harlotries and with thy 
wickedness   
3therefore the showers have been 
withheld   
and there hath been no latter rain   
yet thou hadst a harlot s forehead   
thou refusedst to be ashamed   
4didst thou not just now cry unto  
me my father   
thou art the friend of my youth   
5will he bear grudge for ever   
will he keep it to the end   
behold  thou hast spoken  but hast 
done evil things   
and hast had thy way   
6and the lord said unto me in the 
days of josiah the king  hast thou 
seen that which backsliding israel did  
she went up upon every high mountain 
and under every leafy tree  and there 
played the harlot  7and i said  after 
she hath done all these things  she will 
return unto me  but she returned not  
and her treacherous  sister judah saw 
it 8and i saw  when  forasmuch as 
backsliding israel had committed 
adultery  i had put her away and given 
her a bill of divorcement  that yet 
treacherous judah her sister feared not  
but she also went and played the 3 jeremiah  
667 
 harlot  9and it came to pass through the 
lightness of her harlotry  that the land 
was polluted  and she committed 
adultery with stones and with stocks  
10and yet for all this her treacherous 
sister judah hath not returned unto me 
with her whole heart  but feignedly  
saith the lord 11even the lord said 
unto me backsliding israel hath 
proved herself more righteous than 
treacherous judah  12go and proclaim 
these words toward the north  and say   
return  thou backsliding israel   
saith the lord  
i will not frown upon you   
for i am merciful  saith the lord  
i will not bear grudge for ever   
13only acknowledge thine iniquity   
that thou hast transgressed against 
the lord thy god   
and hast scattered thy ways to the 
strangers  
under every leafy tree   
and ye have not hearkened to my 
voice   
saith the lord  
14return  o backsliding children  saith 
the lord for i am a lord unto you  and 
i will take you one of a city  and two 
of a family  and i will bring you to 
zion  15and i will give you shepherds 
according to my heart  who shall f eed 
you with knowledge and 
understanding  16and it shall come to 
pass when ye are multiplied and 
increased in the land  in those days  
saith the lord they shall say no more  
the ark of the covenant of the lord 
neither shall it come to mind  neither shall they make mention of it  neither 
shall they miss it  neither shall it be 
made any more  17at that time they 
shall call jerusalem the throne of the 
lord and all the nations shall be 
gathered unto it  to the name of the 
lord to jerusalem  neither shall t hey 
walk any more after the stubbornness 
of their evil heart  18in those days the 
house of judah shall walk with the 
house of israel  and they shall come 
together out of the land of the north to 
the land that i have given for an 
inheritance unto your fathe rs  
 
19but i said  how would i put thee 
among the sons   
and give thee a pleasant land   
the goodliest heritage of the 
nations    
and i said  thou shalt call me  my 
father   
and shalt not turn away from 
following me   
20surely as a wife treacherously  
departeth from her husband   
so have ye dealt treacherously with 
me o house of israel   
saith the lord  
 
21hark  upon the high hills is heard  
the suppliant weeping of the 
children of israel   
for that they have perverted their 
way  
they have forgotten  the lord their 
god  
 
22return  ye backsliding children   jeremiah  
668 
 i will heal your backslidings   
here we are  we are come unto 
thee   
for thou art the lord our god   
23truly vain have proved the hills   
the uproar on the mountains   
truly in the lord our god  
is the salvation of israel   
24but the shameful thing hath 
devoured  
the labour of our fathers from our 
youth   
their flocks and their herds   
their sons and their daughters   
25let us lie down in our shame   
and let our confusion cover us   
for we have si nned against the lord 
our god   
we and our fathers   
from our youth even unto this day   
and we have not hearkened  
to the voice of the lord our god   
 
if thou wilt return  o israel   
saith the lord  
yea return unto me   
and if thou wilt put away thy 
detestable things out of my sight   
and wilt not waver   
2and wilt swear  as the lord 
liveth  
in truth  in justice  and in 
righteousness   
then shall the nations bless 
themselves by him   
and in him shall they glory   
 
3for thus saith the lord to the men 
of judah and to jerusalem   break up for you a fallow ground   
and sow not among thorns   
4circumcise yourselves to the lord  
and take away the foreskins of your 
heart   
ye men of judah and inhabitants of 
jerusalem   
lest my fury go forth like fire   
and burn that none can quench it   
because of the evil of your doings   
 
5declare ye in judah  and publish in 
jerusalem   
and say  blow ye the horn in the 
land  
cry aloud and say   
assemble yourselves  and let us go 
into the fortified cities   
6set up a s tandard toward zion   
put yourselves under covert  stay 
not  
for i will bring evil from the north   
and a great destruction   
7a lion is gone up from his thicket   
and a destroyer of nations  
is set out  gone forth from his place   
to make thy land desola te  
that thy cities be laid waste  
without inhabitant   
8for this gird you with sackcloth   
lament and wail   
for the fierce anger of the lord  
is not turned back from us   
9and it shall come to pass at that 
day  
saith the lord  
that the heart of the ki ng shall fail   
and the heart of the princes   
and the priests shall be astonished   4 jeremiah  
669 
 and the prophets shall wonder   
 
10then said i  ah lord g od surely 
thou hast greatly deceived this people 
and jerusalem  saying  ye shall have 
peace  whereas the sword reacheth 
unto the soul   
11at that time shall it be said of this 
people and of jerusalem   
a hot wind of the high hills in the 
wilderness  
toward the daughter of my people   
not to fan  nor to cleanse   
12a wind too strong for this shall 
come for me   
now will i also utter judgments 
against them   
13behold  he cometh up as clouds   
and his chariots are as the 
whirlwind   
his horses are swifter than eagles  
woe unto us  for we are 
undone  
14o jerusalem  wash thy heart from 
wickedness   
that thou mayest be saved   
how long shall thy baleful thoughts  
lodge within thee   
15for hark  one declareth from dan   
and announceth calamity from the 
hills of ephraim   
16make ye mention to the nations   
behold publish concerning 
jerusalem  
watchers come from a far c ountry   
and give out their voice against the 
cities of judah   
17as keepers of a field  
are they against her round about   because she hath been rebellious 
against me   
saith the lord  
18thy way and thy doings have 
procured  
these things unto thee   
this is thy wickedness  yea it is 
bitter   
yea it reacheth unto thy heart   
 
19my bowels  my bowels  i writhe in 
pain  
the chambers of my heart   
my heart moaneth within me   
i cannot hold my peace   
because thou hast heard  o my soul  
the sound of the hor n  
the alarm of war   
20destruction followeth upon 
destruction   
for the whole land is spoiled   
suddenly are my tents spoiled   
my curtains in a moment   
21how long shall i see the standard   
shall i hear the sound of the horn   
 
22for my people is fooli sh  
they know me not   
they are sottish children   
and they have no understanding   
they are wise to do evil   
but to do good they have no knowl 
edge   
 
23i beheld the earth   
and lo it was waste and void   
and the heavens  and they had no 
light  jeremiah  
670 
 24i beheld the mountains  and lo 
they trembled   
and all the hills moved to and fro   
25i beheld  and lo there was no 
man  
and all the birds of the heavens 
were fled   
26i beheld  and lo the fruitful field 
was a wilderness   
and all the cities thereof we re 
broken down  
at the presence of the lord  
and before his fierce anger   
 
27for thus saith the lord  
the whole land shall be desolate   
yet will i not make a full end   
28for this shall the earth mourn   
and the heavens above be black   
because i have spoken it  i have 
purposed it   
and i have not repented  neither 
will i turn back from it   
29for the noise of the horsemen and 
bowmen  
the whole city fleeth   
they go into the thickets   
and climb up upon the rocks   
every city is forsaken   
and not a man  dwelleth therein   
30and thou  that art spoiled  what 
doest thou   
that thou clothest thyself with 
scarlet   
that thou deckest thee with 
ornaments of gold   
that thou enlargest thine eyes with 
paint   
in vain dost thou make thyself fair   thy lovers despi se thee  they seek 
thy life   
31for i have heard a voice as of a 
woman in travail   
the anguish as of her that bringeth 
forth her first child   
the voice of the daughter of zion  
that gaspeth for breath   
that spreadeth her hands   
woe is me  now for my soul 
fainteth  
before the murderers   
 
run ye to and fro through the 
 streets of jerusalem   
and see now  and know   
and seek in the broad places 
thereof   
if ye can find a man   
if there be any that doeth justly  that 
seeketh truth   
and i will pardon her  
2and though they say  as the lord 
liveth   
surely they swear falsely   
3o lord are not thine eyes upon 
truth   
thou hast stricken them  but they 
were not affected   
thou hast consumed them  but they 
have refused to receive 
correction   
they have m ade their faces harder 
than a rock   
they have refused to return   
4and i said  surely these are poor   
they are foolish  for they know not 
the way of the lord  
nor the ordinance of their god   5 jeremiah  
671 
 5i will get me unto the great men   
and will speak unto them   
for they know the way of the lord  
and the ordinance of their god   
but these had altogether broken the 
yoke   
and burst the bands   
6wherefore a lion out of the forest 
doth slay them   
a wolf of the deserts doth spoil 
them   
a leopard watcheth over t heir cities   
every one that goeth out thence is 
torn in pieces   
because their transgressions are 
many   
their backslidings are increased   
 
7wherefore should i pardon thee   
the children have forsaken me   
and sworn by no gods   
and when i had fed them t o the full  
they committed adultery   
and assembled themselves in troops 
at the harlots houses   
8they are become as well fed 
horses  lusty stallions   
every one neigheth after his 
neighbour s wife   
9shall i not punish for these things   
saith the lord  
and shall not my soul be avenged  
on such a nation as this   
 
10go ye up into her rows  and 
destroy   
but make not a full end   
take away her shoots   
for they are not the l ords  11for the house of israel and the 
house of judah  
have dealt very treachero usly 
against me   
saith the lord  
12they have belied the lord  
and said  it is not he   
neither shall evil come upon us   
neither shall we see sword nor 
famine   
13and the prophets shall become 
wind   
and the word is not in them   
thus be it done unto t hem  
14wherefore thus saith the lord the 
god of hosts   
because ye speak this word   
behold  i will make my words in 
thy mouth fire   
and this people wood  and it shall 
devour them   
15lo i will bring a nation upon you 
from far   
o house of israel  saith the lord  
it is an enduring nation   
it is an ancient nation   
a nation whose language thou 
knowest not   
neither understandest what they 
say  
16their quiver is an open sepulchre   
they are all mighty men   
17and they shall eat up thy harvest  
and thy  bread   
they shall eat up thy sons and thy 
daughters   
they shall eat up thy flocks and thy 
herds   jeremiah  
672 
 they shall eat up thy vines and thy 
figtrees   
they shall batter thy fortified cities   
wherein thou trusteth  with the 
sword   
18but even in those days  saith the 
lord  
i will not make a full end with you   
19and it shall come to pass  when ye 
shall say  wherefore hath the lord 
our god done all these things unto us  
then shalt thou say unto them  like 
as ye have forsaken me  and served 
strange gods in your land  so shall ye 
serve strangers in a land that is not 
yours   
 
20declare ye this in the house of 
jacob   
and announce it in judah  saying   
21hear now this  o foolish people  
and without understanding   
that have eyes  and see not   
that have ears  and hear not   
22fear ye not me  saith the lord  
will ye not tremble at my presence   
who have placed the sand for the 
bound of the sea   
an everlasting ordinance  which it 
cannot pass   
and though the waves thereof toss 
themselves  yet can they not 
prevail  
though they roar  yet can they not 
pass over it   
23but this people hath a revolting 
and a rebellious heart   
they are revolted  and gone   
24neither say they in their heart   let us now fear the lord our god   
that giveth the former rain  and the 
latter in due season   
that keepeth for us  
the appointed weeks of the 
harvest   
25your iniquities have turned away 
these things   
and your sins have withholden 
good from you   
26for among my people are found 
wicked men   
they pry  as fowlers lie in wait   
they set a trap  they catch men   
27as a cage is full of birds   
so are their houses full of deceit   
therefore they are become great  
and waxen rich   
28they are waxen fat  they are 
become sleek   
yea they overpass in deeds of 
wickedness   
they plead no t the cause  the cause 
of the fatherless   
that they might make it to prosper   
and the right of the needy do they 
not judge   
29shall i not punish for these things   
saith the lord  
shall not my soul be avenged  
on such a nation as this   
 
30an appalling  and horrible thing  
is come to pass in the land   
31the prophets prophesy in the 
service of falsehood   
and the priests bear rule at their 
beck   
and my people love to have it so   jeremiah  
673 
 what then will ye do in the end 
thereof   
 
put yourselves under covert  ye 
 children of benjamin   
away from the midst of jerusalem   
and blow the horn in tekoa   
and set up a signal on beth cherem   
for evil looketh forth from the 
north   
and a great destruction   
2the comely and delicate one   
the daughter of zion  will i cu t off  
3shepherds with their flocks come 
unto her   
they pitch their tents against her 
round about   
they feed bare every one what is 
nigh at hand   
4prepare ye war against her   
arise and let us go up at noon    
woe unto us  for the day declineth   
for the shadows of the evening are 
stretched out    
5arise  and let us go up by night   
and let us destroy her palaces   
 
6for thus hath the lord of hosts 
said  
hew ye down her trees   
and cast up a mound against 
jerusalem   
this is the city to be punis hed  
everywhere there is oppression in 
the midst of her   
7as a cistern welleth with her 
waters   
so she welleth with her wickedness   
violence and spoil is heard in her   before me continually is sickness 
and wounds   
8be thou corrected  o jerusalem   
lest my soul be alienated from thee   
lest i make thee desolate   
a land not inhabited   
 
9thus saith the lord of hosts   
they shall thoroughly glean as a 
vine  
the remnant of israel   
turn again thy hand  
as a grape gatherer upon the shoots   
10to whom shal l i speak and give 
warning   
that they may hear   
behold  their ear is dull   
and they cannot attend   
behold  the word of the lord is 
become unto them a reproach   
they have no delight in it   
11therefore i am full of the fury of 
the lord  
i am weary wit h holding in   
pour it out upon the babes in the 
street   
and upon the assembly of young 
men together   
for even the husband with the wife 
shall be taken   
the aged with him that is full of 
days  
12and their houses shall be turned 
unto others   
their fiel ds and their wives 
together   
for i will stretch out my hand upon 
the inhabitants of the land   
saith the lord  6 jeremiah  
674 
 13for from the least of them even 
unto the greatest of them  
every one is greedy for gain   
and from the prophet even unto the 
priest  
every on e dealeth falsely   
14they have healed also the hurt of 
my people lightly   
saying  peace  peace  when there 
is no peace   
15they shall be put to shame 
because they have committed 
abomination   
yea they are not at all ashamed   
neither know they how to blush   
therefore they shall fall among 
them that fall   
at the time that i punish them they 
shall stumble   
saith the lord  
 
16thus saith the lord  
stand ye in the ways and see   
and ask for the old paths   
where is the good way  and walk 
therein   
and ye shall find rest for your souls   
but they said  we will not walk 
therein   
17and i set watchmen over you   
attend to the sound of the horn   
but they said  we will not attend   
18therefore hear  ye nations   
and know  o congregation  what is 
again st them   
19hear  o earth   
behold  i will bring evil upon this 
people   
even the fruit of their thoughts   because they have not attended unto 
my words   
and as for my teaching  they have 
rejected it   
20to what purpose is to me the 
frankincense that come th from 
sheba   
and the sweet cane  from a far 
country   
your burnt offerings are not 
acceptable   
nor your sacrifices pleasing unto 
me  
21therefore thus saith the lord 
behold  i will lay 
stumblingblocks before this 
people   
and the fathers and the sons 
together shall stumble against 
them   
the neighbour and his friend  and 
they shall perish   
 
22thus saith the lord  
behold  a people cometh from the 
north country   
and a great nation shall be roused 
from the uttermost parts of the 
earth   
23they lay hold  on bow and spear   
they are cruel  and have no 
compassion   
their voice is like the roaring sea   
and they ride upon horses   
set in array  as a man for war   
against thee  o daughter of zion   
 
24we have heard the fame thereof  
our hands wax feeble   jeremiah  
675 
 anguish hath taken hold of us   
and pain  as of a woman in travail   
25go not forth into the field   
nor walk by the way   
for there is the sword of the enemy   
and terror on every side   
26o daughter of my people  gird thee 
with sackcloth   
and wallow thys elf in ashes   
make thee mourning  as for an only 
son  
most bitter lamentation   
for the spoiler shall suddenly come 
upon us   
 
27i have made thee a tower and a 
fortress among my people   
that thou mayest know and try their 
way  
28they are all grievous r evolters   
going about with slanders   
they are brass and iron   
they all of them deal corruptly   
29the bellows blow fiercely   
the lead is consumed of the fire   
in vain doth the founder refine   
for the wicked are not separated   
30refuse silver shall m en call them   
because the lord hath rejected 
them   
 
the word that came to jeremiah 
from the lord saying  2stand in 
the gate of the l ords house  and 
proclaim there this word  and say  
hear the word of the lord all ye of 
judah  that enter in at these gates to 
worship the lord 3thus saith the lord 
of hosts  the god of israel   amend your ways and your doings  
and i will cause you to dwell in this 
place  4trust ye not in lying words  
saying  the temple of the lord the 
temple of the lord the temple of  the 
lord are these  5nay but if ye 
thoroughly amend your ways and your 
doings  if ye thoroughly execute 
justice between a man and his 
neighbour  6if ye oppress not the 
stranger  the fatherless  and the widow  
and shed not innocent blood in this 
place  neither walk after other gods to 
your hurt  7then will i cause you to 
dwell in this place  in the land that i 
gave to your fathers  for ever and ever  
8behold  ye trust in lying words  that 
cannot profit  9will ye steal  murder  
and commit adultery  and sw ear 
falsely  and offer unto baal  and walk 
after other gods whom ye have not 
known  10and come and stand before 
me in this house  whereupon my name 
is called  and say  we are delivered  
that ye may do all these abominations  
11is this house  whereupon my  name is 
called  become a den of robbers in 
your eyes  behold  i even i  have seen 
it saith the lord 12for go ye now unto 
my place which was in shiloh  where i 
caused my name to dwell at the first  
and see what i did to it for the 
wickedness of my peopl e israel  13and 
now because ye have done all these 
works  saith the lord and i spoke 
unto you  speaking betimes and often  
but ye heard not  and i called you  but 
ye answered not  14therefore will i do 
unto the house  whereupon my name 7 jeremiah  
676 
 is called  wherein  ye trust  and unto the 
place which i gave to you and to your 
fathers  as i have done to shiloh  
15and i will cast you out of my sight  
as i have cast out all your brethren  
even the whole seed of ephraim   
16therefore pray not thou for this 
people  neithe r lift up cry nor prayer 
for them  neither make intercession to 
me for i will not hear thee  17seest 
thou not what they do in the cities of 
judah and in the streets of jerusalem  
18the children gather wood  and the 
fathers kindle the fire  and the women 
knead the dough  to make cakes to the 
queen of heaven  and to pour out 
drink offerings unto other gods  that 
they may provoke me  19do they 
provoke me  saith the lord do they 
not provoke themselves  to the 
confusion of their own faces  
20therefore thus sai th the lord g od 
behold  mine anger and my fury shall 
be poured out upon this place  upon 
man and upon beast  and upon the 
trees of the field  and upon the fruit of 
the land  and it shall burn  and shall 
not be quenched   
21thus saith the lord of hosts  the 
god of israel  add your burnt 
offerings unto your sacrifices  and eat 
ye flesh  22for i spoke not unto your 
fathers  nor commanded them in the 
day that i brought them out of the land 
of egypt  concerning burnt offerings 
or sacrifices  23but this thing i  
commanded them  saying  hearken 
unto my voice  and i will be your god  
and ye shall be my people  and walk ye in all the way that i command you  
that it may be well with you  24but 
they hearkened not  nor inclined their 
ear but walked in their own coun sels 
even in the stubbornness of their evil 
heart  and went backward and not 
forward  25even since the day that your 
fathers came forth out of the land of 
egypt unto this day  and though i have 
sent unto you all my servants the 
prophets  sending them dail y betimes 
and often  26yet they hearkened not 
unto me  nor inclined their ear  but 
made their neck stiff  they did worse 
than their fathers   
27and thou shalt speak all these 
words unto them  but they will not 
hearken to thee  thou shalt also call 
unto the m but they will not answer 
thee 28therefore thou shalt say unto 
them   
this is the nation that hath not 
hearkened  
to the voice of the lord their god   
nor received correction   
faithfulness is perished   
and is cut off from their mouth   
 
29cut off thy hair and cast it away   
and take up a lamentation on the 
high hills   
for the lord hath rejected and 
forsaken the generation of his 
wrath   
30for the children of judah have done 
that which is evil in my sight  saith the 
lord they have set their detestabl e 
things in the house whereon my name 
is called  to defile it  31and they have jeremiah  
677 
 built the high places of topheth  which 
is in the valley of the son of hinnom  
to burn their sons and their daughters 
in the fire  which i commanded not  
neither came it into my  mind  
32therefore  behold  the days come  
saith the lord that it shall no more be 
called topheth  nor the valley of the 
son of hinnom  but the valley of 
slaughter  for they shall bury in 
topheth  for lack of room  33and the 
carcasses of this people shall  be food 
for the fowls of the heaven  and for the 
beasts of the earth  and none shall 
frighten them away  34then will i 
cause to cease from the cities of judah  
and from the streets of jerusalem  the 
voice of mirth and the voice of 
gladness  the voice of t he bridegroom 
and the voice of the bride  for the land  
shall be deso late 1at that time  
saith the lord they shall bring 
out the bones of the kings of judah  
and the bones of his princes  and the 
bones of the priests  and the bones of 
the prophets  and the bones of the 
inhabitants of jerusalem  out of their 
graves  2and they shall spread them 
before the sun  and the moon  and all 
the host of heaven  whom they have 
loved  and whom they have served  
and after whom they have walked  and 
whom they have soug ht and whom 
they have worshipped  they shall not 
be gathered  nor be buried  they shall 
be for dung upon the face of the earth  
3and death shall be chosen rather than 
life by all the residue that remain of 
this evil family  that remain in all the places w hither i have driven them  
saith the lord of hosts   
4moreover thou shalt say unto them  
thus saith the lord  
do men fall  and not rise up again   
doth one turn away  and not return   
5why then is this people of 
jerusalem slidden back  
by a perpetual back sliding   
they hold fast deceit   
they refuse to return   
6i attended and listened   
but they spoke not aright   
no man repenteth him of his 
wickedness   
saying  what have i done   
every one turneth away in his 
course   
as a horse that rusheth headlong i n 
the battle   
7yea the stork in the heaven  
knoweth her appointed times   
and the turtle and the swallow and 
the crane  
observe the time of their coming   
but my people know not  
the ordinance of the lord  
8how do ye say  we are wise   
and the law of t he lord is with 
us  
lo certainly in vain hath wrought  
the vain pen of the scribes   
9the wise men are ashamed   
they are dismayed and taken   
lo they have rejected the word of 
the lord  
and what wisdom is in them   
 8 jeremiah  
678 
 10therefore will i give their wive s 
unto others   
and their fields to them that shall 
possess them   
for from the least even unto the 
greatest  
every one is greedy for gain   
from the prophet even unto the 
priest  
every one dealeth falsely   
11and they have healed the hurt of 
the daughter of my people lightly   
saying  peace  peace  when there 
is no peace   
12they shall be put to shame 
because they have committed 
abomination   
yea they are not at all ashamed   
neither know they how to blush  
therefore shall they fall among 
them that fall   
in the time of their visitation they 
shall stumble   
saith the lord  
 
13i will utterly consume them  saith 
the lord  
there are no grapes on the vine   
nor figs on the fig tree  
and the leaf is faded   
and i gave them that which they 
transgress   
14why do we sit still   
assemble yourselves  and let us 
enter into the fortified cities   
and let us be cut off there   
for the lord our god hath cut us 
off  
and given us water of gall to drink   because we have sinned against the 
lord  
15we looked for peac e but no good 
came   
and for a time of healing  and 
behold terror    
16the snorting of his horses is heard 
from dan   
at the sound of the neighing of his 
strong ones  
the whole land trembleth   
for they are come  and have 
devoured the land and all that i s 
in it  
the city and those that dwell 
therein   
17for behold  i will send serpents  
basilisks  among you   
which will not be charmed   
and they shall bite you  saith the 
lord  
 
18though i would take comfort 
against sorrow   
my heart is faint within me   
19behold the voice of the cry of the 
daughter of my people  
from a land far off   
is not the lord in zion   
is not her king in her   
why have they provoked me with 
their graven images   
and with strange vanities   
20the harvest is past  the summer  is 
ended   
and we are not saved   
21for the hurt of the daughter of my 
people am i seized with anguish   jeremiah  
679 
 i am black  appalment hath taken 
hold on me   
22is there no balm in gilead   
is there no physician there   
why then is not the health  
of the daughte r of my people 
recovered   
23oh that my head were waters   
and mine eyes a fountain of tears   
that i might weep day and night  
for the slain of the daughter of my 
people   
 
oh that i were in the wilderness   
in a lodging place of wayfaring 
 men  
that i might leave my people   
and go from them   
for they are all adulterers   
an assembly of treacherous men   
2and they bend their tongue  their 
bow of falsehood   
and they are grown mighty in the 
land but not for truth   
for they proceed from evil to evil   
and me they know not   
saith the lord  
3take ye heed every one of his 
neighbour   
and trust ye not in any brother   
for every brother acteth subtly   
and every neighbour goeth about 
with slanders   
4and they deceive every one his 
neighbour   
and truth th ey speak not   
they have taught their tongue to 
speak lies   they weary themselves to commit 
iniquity   
5thy habitation is in the midst of 
deceit   
through deceit they refuse to know 
me  
saith the lord  
 
6therefore thus saith the lord of 
hosts   
behold  i will smelt them  and try 
them   
for how else should i do   
because of the daughter of my 
people   
7their tongue is a sharpened arrow   
it speaketh deceit   
one speaketh peaceably to his 
neighbour with his mouth   
but in his heart he layeth wait for 
him  
8shall i not punish them for these 
things   
saith the lord  
shall not my soul be avenged  
on such a nation as this   
9for the mountains will i take up a 
weeping and wailing   
and for the pastures of the 
wilderness a lamentation   
because they are burned up so that 
none passeth through   
and they hear not the voice of the 
cattle   
both the fowl of the heavens and the 
beast  
are fled  and gone   
10and i will make jerusalem heaps   
a lair of jackals   9 jeremiah  
680 
 and i will make the cities of judah a 
desolation   
without an inhabitant   
 
11who is the wise man  that he may 
understand this   
and who is he to whom the mouth 
of the lord hath spoken  that he 
may declare it   
wherefore is the land perished  
and laid waste like a wilderness  so 
that none passeth through   
12 and the lord saith   
because they have forsaken my law 
which i set before them   
and have not hearkened to my 
voice  neither walked therein   
13 but have walked after the 
stubbornness of their own heart   
and after the baalim  which their 
fathers taught the m  
14therefore thus saith the lord of 
hosts  the god of israel   
behold  i will feed them  even this 
people  with wormwood   
and give them water of gall to 
drink   
15i will scatter them also among the 
nations   
whom neither they nor their fathers 
have kno wn  
and i will send the sword after 
them   
till i have consumed them   
 
16thus saith the lord of hosts   
consider ye  and call for the 
mourning women  that they may 
come   and send for the wise women  that 
they may come   
17let them make haste  and take u p a 
wailing for us   
that our eyes may run down with 
tears   
and our eyelids gush out with 
waters   
18for a voice of wailing is heard out 
of zion   
how are we undone   
we are greatly confounded  because 
we have forsaken the land   
because our dwellings ha ve cast us 
out  
19yea hear the word of the lord o 
ye women   
and let your ear receive the word of 
his mouth   
and teach your daughters wailing   
and every one her neighbour 
lamentation   
20for death is come up into our 
windows   
it is entered into our  palaces   
to cut off the children from the 
street   
and the young men from the broad 
places   
21speak  thus saith the lord 
and the carcasses of men fall  
as dung upon the open field   
and as the handful after the 
harvestman   
which none gathereth   
 
22thus saith the lord  
let not the wise man glory in his 
wisdom   jeremiah  
681 
 neither let the mighty man glory in 
his might   
let not the rich man glory in his 
riches   
23but let him that glorieth glory in 
this  
that he understandeth  and knoweth 
me  
that i am the lord who exercise 
mercy   
justice  and righteousness  in the 
earth   
for in these things i delight   
saith the lord  
 
24behold  the days come  saith the 
lord that i will punish all them that 
are circumcised in their 
uncircumcision  25egypt  and judah  
and edom  and the children of 
ammon  and moab  and all that have 
the corners of their hair polled  that 
dwell in the wilderness   
for all the nations are 
uncircumcised   
but all the house of israel are 
uncircumcised in the heart   
 
hear ye the word which th e 
lord speaketh unto you  o 
house of israel  2thus saith the lord  
learn not the way of the nations   
and be not dismayed at the signs of 
heaven   
for the nations are dismayed at 
them   
3for the customs of the peoples are 
vanity   for it is but a tree whi ch one cutteth 
out of the forest   
the work of the hands of the 
workman with the axe   
4they deck it with silver and with 
gold  
they fasten it with nails and with 
hammers  that it move not   
5they are like a pillar in a garden of 
cucumbers  and speak not   
they must needs be borne  because 
they cannot go   
be not afraid of them  for they 
cannot do evil   
neither is it in them to do good   
 
6there is none like unto thee  o 
lord  
thou art great  and thy name is 
great in might   
7who would not fear thee  o king 
of the nations   
for it befitteth thee   
forasmuch as among all the wise 
men of the nations  and in all their 
royalty   
there is none like unto thee   
8but they are altogether brutish and 
foolish   
the vanities by which they are 
instructed are but a st ock  
9silver beaten into plates which is 
brought from tarshish   
and gold from uphaz   
the work of the craftsman and of 
the hands of the goldsmith   
blue and purple is their clothing   
they are all the work of skilful men   
10but the lord god is the true god  10 jeremiah  
682 
 he is the living god  and the 
everlasting king   
at his wrath the earth trembleth   
and the nations are not able to abide 
his indignation   
 
11thus shall ye say unto them  the 
gods that have not made the heavens 
and the earth  these shall perish fro m 
the earth  and from under the heavens   
 
12he that hath made the earth by his 
power   
that hath established the world by 
his wisdom   
and hath stretched out the heavens 
by his understanding   
13at the sound of his giving a 
multitude of waters in the 
heavens  
when he causeth the vapours to 
ascend from the ends of the earth   
when he maketh lightnings with 
the rain   
and bringeth forth the wind out of 
his treasuries   
14every man is proved to be brutish  
without knowledge   
every goldsmith is put to shame  by 
the graven image   
his molten image is falsehood  and 
there is no breath in them   
15they are vanity  a work of 
delusion   
in the time of their visitation they 
shall perish   
16not like these is the portion of 
jacob   
for he is the former of all things   and israel is the tribe of his 
inheritance   
the lord of hosts is his name   
 
 
17gather up thy wares from the 
ground   
o thou that abidest in the siege   
18for thus saith the lord behold  i 
will sling out the inhabitants of the 
land at this time  and w ill distress 
them  that they may feel it   
 
19woe is me for my hurt   
my wound is grievous   
but i said  this is but a sickness   
and i must bear it   
20my tent is spoiled   
and all my cords are broken   
my children are gone forth of me  
and they are not   
there is none to stretch forth my 
tent any more   
and to set up my curtains   
21for the shepherds are become 
brutish   
and have not inquired of the lord  
therefore they have not prospered   
and all their flocks are scattered   
22hark  a report  behold  it cometh   
and a great commotion out of the 
north country   
to make the cities of judah 
desolate   
a dwelling place of jackals   
23o lord i know that man s way is 
not his own   
it is not in man to direct his steps as 
he walketh   jeremiah  
683 
 24o lord correct me  but in 
measure   
not in thine anger  lest thou 
diminish me   
25pour out thy wrath upon the 
nations that know thee not   
and upon the families that call not 
on thy name   
for they have devoured jacob   
yea they have devoured him and 
consumed him   
and have laid waste his habitation   
 
the word that came to 
jeremiah from the lord 
saying  2hear ye the words of this 
covenant  and speak unto the men of 
judah  and to the inhabitants of 
jerusalem  3and say thou unto them  
thus saith the lord the god of israe l 
cursed be the man that heareth not the 
words of this covenant  4which i 
commanded your fathers in the day 
that i brought them forth out of the 
land of egypt  out of the iron furnace  
saying  hearken to my voice  and do 
them  according to all which i 
command you  so shall ye be my 
people  and i will be your god  5that i 
may establish the oath which i swore 
unto your fathers  to give them a land 
flowing with milk and honey  as at this 
day then answered i  and said  
amen  o lord  
6and the lord said unt o me  
proclaim all these words in the cities 
of judah  and in the streets of 
jerusalem  saying  hear ye the words 
of this covenant  and do them  7for i earnestly forewarned your fathers in 
the day that i brought them up out of 
the land of egypt  even unto  this day  
forewarning betimes and often  saying  
hearken to my voice  8yet they 
hearkened not  nor inclined their ear  
but walked every one in the 
stubbornness of their evil heart  
therefore i brought upon them all the 
words of this covenant  which i 
comm anded them to do  but they did 
them not   
9and the lord said unto me  a 
conspiracy is found among the men of 
judah  and among the inhabitants of 
jerusalem  10they are turned back to 
the iniquities of their forefathers  who 
refused to hear my words  and t hey are 
gone after other gods to serve them  
the house of israel and the house of 
judah have broken my covenant which 
i made with their fathers  11therefore 
thus saith the lord behold  i will 
bring evil upon them  which they shall 
not be able to escape  and though they 
shall cry unto me  i will not hearken 
unto them  12then shall the cities of 
judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem 
go and cry unto the gods unto whom 
they offer  but they shall not save them 
at all in the time of their trouble  13for 
accordi ng to the number of thy cities 
are thy gods  o judah  and according 
to the number of the streets of 
jerusalem have ye set up altars to the 
shameful thing  even altars to offer 
unto baal  14therefore pray not thou 
for this people  neither lift up cry nor 
prayer for them  for i will not hear 11 jeremiah  
684 
 them in the time that they cry unto me 
for their trouble   
 
15what hath my beloved to do in 
my house   
seeing she hath wrought lewdness 
with many   
and the hallowed flesh is passed 
from thee   
when thou doest evil  then thou 
rejoicest   
16the lord called thy name  
a leafy olive tree fair with goodly 
fruit  
with the noise of a great tumult  
he hath kindled fire upon it   
and the branches of it are broken   
17for the lord of hosts  that planted 
thee hath pronounced evil against 
thee because of the evil of the house 
of israel and of the house of judah  
which they have wrought for 
themselves in provoking me by 
offering unto baal   
 
18and the lord gave me knowledge 
of it and i knew it   
then thou showedst me their 
doings   
19but i was like a docile lamb that is 
led to the slaughter   
and i knew not that they had 
devised devices against me   
let us destroy the tree with the fruit 
thereof   
and let us cut him off from the land 
of the living   
that his name may be no more 
remembered   20but o lord of hosts  that judgest 
righteously   
that triest the reins and the heart   
let me see thy vengeance on them   
for unto thee have i revealed my 
cause   
21therefore thus saith the lord 
concerning the men of anathoth  that 
seek thy li fe saying  thou shalt not 
prophesy in the name of the lord that 
thou die not by our hand  22therefore 
thus saith the lord of hosts   
behold  i will punish them   
the young men shall die by the 
sword   
their sons and their daughters shall 
die by famine   
23and there shall be no remnant 
unto them   
for i will bring evil upon the men of 
anathoth   
even the year of their visitation   
 
right wouldest thou be  o 
 lord  
were i to contend with thee   
yet will i reason with thee   
wherefore doth the way of t he 
wicked prosper   
wherefore are all they secure that 
deal very treacherously   
2thou hast planted them  yea they 
have taken root   
they grow  yea they bring forth 
fruit  
thou art near in their mouth   
and far from their reins   
3but thou  o lord know est me   12 jeremiah  
685 
 thou seest me  and triest my heart 
toward thee   
pull them out like sheep for the 
slaughter   
and prepare them for the day of 
slaughter   
 
4how long shall the land mourn   
and the herbs of the whole field 
wither   
for the wickedness of them that 
dwell therein  the beasts are 
consumed  and the birds   
because they said  he seeth not our 
end  
 
5if thou hast run with the footmen  
and they have wearied thee   
then how canst thou contend with 
horses   
and though in a land of peace thou 
art secure   
yet how wilt thou do in the thickets 
of the jordan   
6for even thy brethren  and the 
house of thy father   
even they have dealt treacherously 
with thee   
even they have cried aloud after 
thee  
believe them not  though they speak 
fair words unto thee   
 
7i have forsaken my house   
i have cast off my heritage   
i have given the dearly beloved of 
my soul  
into the hand of her enemies   
8my heritage is become unto me  as a lion in the forest   
she hath uttered her voice against 
me  
therefore have i hated her   
9is my heritage unto me as a 
speckled bird of prey   
are the birds of prey against her 
round about   
come ye  assemble all the beasts of 
the field   
bring them to devour   
10many shepherds have destroyed 
my vineyard   
they have trodden my portion 
under foot  
they have made my pleasant 
portion  
a desolate wilderness   
11they have made it a desolation   
it mourneth unto me  being 
desolate   
the whole land is made desolate   
because no man layeth it to heart   
12upon all the high hills in the 
wilderness sp oilers are come   
for the sword of the lord devoureth  
from the one end of the land even to 
the other end of the land   
no flesh hath peace   
13they have sown wheat  and have 
reaped thorns   
they have put themselves to pain  
they profit not   
be ye then as hamed of your 
increase   
because of the fierce anger of the 
lord  
 jeremiah  
686 
 14thus saith the lord as for all 
mine evil neighbours  that touch the 
inheritance which i have caused my 
people israel to inherit  behold  i will 
pluck them up from off their land  and 
will pluck up the house of judah from 
among them  15and it shall come to 
pass after that i have plucked them up  
i will again have compassion on them  
and i will bring them back  every man 
to his heritage  and every man to his 
land 16and it shall come to p ass if 
they will diligently learn the ways of 
my people to swear by my name  as 
the lord liveth  even as they taught 
my people to swear by baal  then shall 
they be built up in the midst of my 
people  17but if they will not hearken  
then will i pluck up that nation  
plucking up and destroying it  saith the 
lord  
 
thus said the lord unto me  
go and get thee a linen 
girdle  and put it upon thy loins  and 
put it not in water  2so i got a girdle 
according to the word of the lord and 
put it upon my loi ns  
3and the word of the lord came 
unto me the second time  saying  
4take the girdle that thou hast gotten  
which is upon thy loins  and arise  go 
to perath  and hide it there in a cleft of 
the rock  5so i went  and hid it in 
perath  as the lord command ed me  
6and it came to pass after many days  
that the lord said unto me  arise  go 
to perath  and take the girdle from 
thence  which i commanded thee to hide there  7then i went to perath  
and digged  and took the girdle from 
the place where i had hid it  and 
behold  the girdle was marred  it was 
profitable for nothing   
8then the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying   
9thus saith the lord after this 
manner will i mar the pride of judah  
and the great pride of jerusalem  
10even this evil people  that r efuse to 
hear my words  that walk in the 
stubbornness of their heart  and are 
gone after other gods to serve them  
and to worship them  that it be as this 
girdle  which is profitable for nothing  
11for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins 
of a man  so have i caused to cleave 
unto me the whole house of israel and 
the whole house of judah  saith the 
lord that they might be unto me for a 
people  and for a name  and for a 
praise  and for a glory  but they would 
not hearken   
12moreover thou shalt speak unto 
them this word  thus saith the lord 
the god of israel  every bottle is 
filled with wine  and when they shall 
say unto thee  do we not know that 
every bottle is filled with wine  
13then shalt thou say unto them  thus 
saith the lord behold  i will fill al l 
the inhabitants of this land  even the 
kings that sit upon david s throne  and 
the priests  and the prophets  and all 
the inhabitants of jerusalem  with 
drunkenness  14and i will dash them 
one against another  even the fathers 
and the sons together  saith the lord i 13 jeremiah  
687 
 will not pity  nor spare  nor have 
compassion  that i should not destroy 
them   
 
15hear ye  and give ear  be not 
proud   
for the lord hath spoken   
16give glory to the lord your god   
before it grow dark   
and before your feet stumble  
upon t he mountains of twilight   
and while ye look for light   
he turn it into the shadow of death   
and make it gross darkness   
17but if ye will not hear it   
my soul shall weep in secret for 
your pride   
and mine eyes shall weep sore  and 
run down with tears   
because the l ords flock is carried 
away captive   
 
18say thou unto the king and to the 
queen mother   
sit ye down low   
for your headtires are come down   
even your beautiful crown   
19the cities of the south are shut up   
and there is none to open t hem  
judah is carried away captive all of 
it  
it is wholly carried away captive   
 
20lift up your eyes  and behold  
them that come from the north   
where is the flock that was given 
thee  
thy beautiful flock   21what wilt thou say  when he shall 
set the  friends over thee as head   
whom thou thyself hast trained 
against thee   
shall not pangs take hold of thee   
as of a woman in travail   
22and if thou say in thy heart   
wherefore are these things befallen 
me 
for the greatness of thine iniquity 
are th y skirts uncovered   
and thy heels suffer violence   
23can the ethiopian change his skin   
or the leopard his spots   
then may ye also do good   
that are accustomed to do evil   
24therefore will i scatter them  as 
the stubble that passeth away  
by the wind  of the wilderness   
25this is thy lot  the portion 
measured unto thee from me   
saith the lord  
because thou hast forgotten me   
and trusted in falsehood   
26therefore will i also uncover thy 
skirts upon thy face   
and thy shame shall appear   
27thine ad ulteries  and thy 
neighings  the lewdness of thy 
harlotry   
on the hills in the field have i seen 
thy detestable acts   
woe unto thee  o jerusalem  thou 
wilt not be made clean   
when shall it ever be   
 
the word of the lord that 
came to jeremiah concern ing 
the droughts   14 jeremiah  
688 
 2judah mourneth  and the gates 
thereof languish   
they bow down in black unto the 
ground   
and the cry of jerusalem is gone up   
3and their nobles send their lads for 
water   
they come to the pits  and find no 
water   
their vessels retur n empty   
they are ashamed and confounded  
and cover their heads   
4because of the ground which is 
cracked   
for there hath been no rain in the 
land  
the plowmen are ashamed  they 
cover their heads   
5yea the hind also in the field 
calveth  and forsaketh  her young   
because there is no grass   
6and the wild asses stand on the 
high hills   
they gasp for air like jackals   
their eyes fail  because there is no 
herbage   
7though our iniquities testify 
against us   
o lord work thou for thy name s 
sake  
for our backslidings are many   
we have sinned against thee   
8o thou hope of israel   
the saviour thereof in time of 
trouble   
why shouldest thou be as a 
stranger in the land   
and as a wayfaring man that turneth 
aside to tarry for a night   9why shouldest tho u be as a man 
overcome   
as a mighty man that cannot save   
yet thou  o lord art in the midst 
of us   
and thy name is called upon us   
leave us not   
 
10thus saith the lord unto this 
people   
even so have they loved to wander   
they have not refrained the ir feet   
therefore the lord doth not accept 
them   
now will he remember their 
iniquity   
and punish their sins   
11and the lord said unto me  pray 
not for this people for their good  
12when they fast  i will not hear their 
cry and when they offer burnt 
offering and meal offering  i will not 
accept them  but i will consume them 
by the sword  and by the famine  and 
by the pestilence  13then said i  ah 
lord g od behold  the prophets say 
unto them  ye shall not see the sword  
neither shall ye have famine  but i will 
give you assured peace in this place  
14then the lord said unto me  the 
prophets prophesy lies in my name  i 
sent them not  neither have i 
commanded them  neither spoke i unto 
them  they prophesy unto you a lying 
vision  and divination  and a  thing of 
nought  and the deceit of their own 
heart  15therefore thus saith the lord 
as for the prophets that prophesy in 
my name  and i sent them not  yet they jeremiah  
689 
 say sword and famine shall not be in 
this land  by sword and famine shall 
those prophets be c onsumed  16and the 
people to whom they prophesy shall be 
cast out in the streets of jerusalem 
because of the famine and the sword  
and they shall have none to bury them  
them  their wives  nor their sons  nor 
their daughters  for i will pour their 
evil upo n them   
 
17and thou shalt say this word unto 
them   
let mine eyes run down with tears 
night and day   
and let them not cease   
for the virgin daughter of my 
people is broken with a great 
breach   
with a very grievous blow   
18if i go forth into the field   
then behold the slain with the 
sword   
and if i enter into the city   
then behold them that are sick with 
famine   
for both the prophet and the priest 
are gone about to a land  and 
knew it not   
 
19hast thou utterly rejected judah   
hath thy soul loathe d zion   
why hast thou smitten us  and there 
is no healing for us   
we looked for peace  but no good 
came   
and for a time of healing  and 
behold terror   20we acknowledge  o lord our 
wickedness   
even the iniquity of our fathers   
for we have sinned agai nst thee   
21do not contemn us  for thy 
name s sake   
do not dishonour the throne of thy 
glory   
remember  break not thy covenant 
with us   
22are there any among the vanities 
of the nations that can cause rain   
or can the heavens give showers   
art not th ou he  o lord our god  
and do we not wait for thee   
for thou hast made all these things   
then said the lord unto me  
though moses and samuel 
stood before me  yet my mind could 
not be toward this people  cast them 
out of my sight  and let them go fort h 
2and it shall come to pass  when they 
say unto thee  whither shall we go 
forth  then thou shall tell them  thus 
saith the lord such as are for death  
to death  and such as are for the sword  
to the sword  and such as are for the 
famine  to the famine  and such as are 
for captivity  to captivity  3and i will 
appoint over them four kinds  saith the 
lord the sword to slay  and the dogs 
to drag  and the fowls of the heaven  
and the beasts of the earth  to devour 
and to destroy  4and i will cause them 
to be  a horror among all the kingdoms 
of the earth  because of manasseh the 
son of hezekiah king of judah  for that 
which he did in jerusalem   15 jeremiah  
690 
 5for who shall have pity upon thee  
o jerusalem   
or who shall bemoan thee   
or who shall turn aside to ask of thy 
welfare  
6thou hast cast me off  saith the 
lord  
thou art gone backward   
therefore do i stretch out my hand 
against thee  and destroy thee   
i am weary with repenting   
7and i fan them with a fan in the 
gates of the land   
i bereave them of children  i destroy 
my people   
since they return not from their 
ways   
8their widows are increased to me 
above the sand of the seas   
i bring upon them  against the 
mother  a chosen one   
even a spoiler at noonday   
i cause anguish and terrors to fall 
upon her suddenly   
9she that hath borne seven 
languisheth   
her spirit droopeth   
her sun is gone down while it was 
yet day   
she is ashamed and confounded   
and the residue of them will i 
deliver to the sword before their 
enemies   
saith the lord  
 
10woe is me  my moth er that thou 
hast borne me  
a man of strife and a man of 
contention to the whole earth   i have not lent  neither have men 
lent to me   
yet every one of them doth curse 
me  
11the lord said verily i will release 
thee for good  verily i will cause the 
enemy to make supplication unto thee 
in the time of evil and in the time of 
affliction  12can iron break iron from 
the north and brass  13thy substance 
and thy treasures will i give for a spoil 
without price  and that for all thy sins  
even in all thy border s 14and i will 
make thee to pass with thine enemies 
into a land which thou knowest not  
for a fire is kindled in my nostril  
which shall burn upon you   
 
15thou  o lord knowest   
remember me  and think of me  and 
avenge me of my persecutors   
take me no t away because of thy 
longsuffering   
know that for thy sake i have 
suffered taunts   
16thy words were found  and i did 
eat them   
and thy words were unto me a joy 
and the rejoicing of my heart   
because thy name was called on 
me o lord god of hosts   
17i sat not in the assembly of them 
that make merry  nor rejoiced   
i sat alone because of thy hand   
for thou hast filled me with 
indignation   
18why is my pain perpetual   
and my wound incurable  so that it 
refuseth to be healed   jeremiah  
691 
 wilt thou indeed be unto me as a 
deceitful brook   
as waters that fail   
 
19therefore thus saith the lord  
if thou return  and i bring thee back   
thou shalt stand before me   
and if thou bring forth the precious 
out of the vile   
thou shalt be as my mouth   
let them return unto thee  
but thou shalt not return unto them   
20and i will make thee unto this 
people a fortified brazen wall   
and they shall fight against thee   
but they shall not prevail against 
thee  
for i am with thee to save thee and 
to deliver thee   
saith the lord  
21and i will deliver thee out of the 
hand of the wicked   
and i will redeem thee out of the 
hand of the terrible   
 
the word of the lord came 
also unto me  saying   
2thou shalt not take thee a wife   
neither shalt thou have sons or 
daughters in this  place   
3for thus saith the lord concerning the 
sons and concerning the daughters that 
are born in this place  and concerning 
their mothers that bore them  and 
concerning their fathers that begot 
them in this land   
4they shall die of grievous deaths   
they shall not be lamented   
neither shall they be buried   they shall be as dung upon the face 
of the ground   
and they shall be consumed by the 
sword  and by famine   
and their carcasses shall be meat for 
the fowls of heaven   
and for the beasts of the ear th  
5for thus saith the lord enter not into 
the house of mourning  neither go to 
lament  neither bemoan them  for i 
have taken away my peace from this 
people  saith the lord even mercy and 
compassion  6both the great and the 
small shall die in this land  they shall 
not be buried  neither shall men lament 
for them  nor cut themselves  nor make 
themselves bald for them  7neither 
shall men break bread for them in 
mourning  to comfort them for the 
dead  neither shall men give them the 
cup of consolation to d rink for their 
father or for their mother  8and thou 
shalt not go into the house of feasting 
to sit with them  to eat and to drink  
9for thus saith the lord of hosts  the 
god of israel   
behold  i will cause to cease out of 
this place   
before your eyes an d in your days   
the voice of mirth and the voice of 
gladness   
the voice of the bridegroom and the 
voice of the bride   
10and it shall come to pass  when thou 
shalt tell this people all these words  
and they shall say unto thee  
wherefore hath the lord pronounced 
all this great evil against us  or what is 
our iniquity  or what is our sin that we 16 jeremiah  
692 
 have committed against the lord our 
god 11then shalt thou say unto them  
because your fathers have forsaken 
me saith the lord and have walked 
after other god s and have served 
them  and have worshipped them  and 
have forsaken me  and have not kept 
my law  12and ye have done worse 
than your fathers  for behold  ye walk 
every one after the stubbornness of his 
evil heart  so that ye hearken not unto 
me 13theref ore will i cast you out of 
this land into a land that ye have not 
known  neither ye nor your fathers  
and there shall ye serve other gods day 
and night  forasmuch as i will show 
you no favour   
14therefore  behold  the days come  
saith the lord that it s hall no more be 
said as the lord liveth  that brought 
up the children of israel out of the land 
of egypt  15but as the lord liveth  
that brought up the children of israel 
from the land of the north  and from all 
the countries whither he had driven 
them and i will bring them back into 
their land that i gave unto their fathers   
16behold  i will send for many 
fishers  saith the lord and they shall 
fish them  and afterward i will send for 
many hunters  and they shall hunt 
them from every mountain  and from 
every hill  and out of the clefts of the 
rocks   
17for mine eyes are upon all their 
ways   
they are not hid from my face   
neither is their iniquity concealed 
from mine eyes   18and first i will recompense their 
iniquity and their sin double   
because  they have profaned my 
land  
they have filled mine inheritance  
with the carcasses of their 
detestable things and their 
abominations   
 
19o lord my strength  and my 
stronghold   
and my refuge  in the day of 
affliction   
unto thee shall the nations come  
from the ends of the earth  and shall 
say  
our fathers have inherited nought 
but lies   
vanity and things wherein there is 
no profit   
20shall a man make unto himself 
gods   
and they are no gods   
 
21therefore  behold  i will cause 
them to know   
this o nce will i cause them to know  
my hand and my might   
and they shall know that my name 
is the lord  
 
the sin of judah is written  
with a pen of iron  and with  
  the point of a diamond   
it is graven upon the tablet of their 
heart   
and upon the horns of your altars   
2like the symbols of their sons are 
their altars   17 jeremiah  
693 
 and their asherim are by the leafy 
trees   
upon the high hills   
3o thou that sittest upon the 
mountain in the field   
i will give thy substance and all thy 
treasures for a spoil   
and thy  high places  because of sin  
throughout all thy borders   
4and thou  even of thyself  shalt 
discontinue from thy heritage  
that i gave thee   
and i will cause thee to serve thine 
enemies  
in the land which thou knowest not   
for ye have kindled a fire in my 
nostril   
which shall burn for ever   
 
5thus saith the lord  
cursed is the man that trusteth in 
man  
and maketh flesh his arm   
and whose heart departeth from the 
lord  
6for he shall be like a tamarisk in 
the desert   
and shall not see when good 
come th  
but shall inhabit the parched places 
in the wilderness   
a salt land and not inhabited   
7blessed is the man that trusteth in 
the lord  
and whose trust the lord is  
8for he shall be as a tree planted by 
the waters   
and that spreadeth out its roots by 
the river   and shall not see when heat cometh   
but its foliage shall be luxuriant   
and shall not be anxious in the year 
of drought   
neither shall cease from yielding 
fruit  
 
9the heart is deceitful above all 
things   
and it is exceeding weak who ca n 
know it   
10i the lord search the heart   
i try the reins   
even to give every man according to 
his ways   
according to the fruit of his doings   
 
11as the partridge that broodeth over 
young which she hath not brought 
forth   
so is he that getteth riches  and not 
by right   
in the midst of his days he shall 
leave them   
and at his end he shall be a fool   
 
12thou throne of glory  on high from 
the beginning   
thou place of our sanctuary   
13thou hope of israel  the lord  
all that forsake thee shall be 
ashamed   
they that depart from thee shall be 
written in the earth   
because they have forsaken the 
lord  
the fountain of living waters   
 jeremiah  
694 
 14heal me  o lord and i shall be 
healed   
save me  and i shall be saved   
for thou art my praise   
15behold  they say unto me   
where is the word of the lord let 
it come now   
16as for me  i have not hastened 
from being a shepherd after thee   
neither have i desired the woeful 
day thou knowest it   
that which came out of my lips was 
manifest before thee   
17be not a r uin unto me   
thou art my refuge in the day of 
evil  
18let them be ashamed that 
persecute me  but let not me be 
ashamed   
let them be dismayed  but let not 
me be dismayed   
bring upon them the day of evil   
and destroy them with double 
destruction   
19thus said the lord unto me  go 
and stand in the gate of the children of 
the people  whereby the kings of judah 
come in  and by which they go out  
and in all the gates of jerusalem  20and 
say unto them   
hear ye the word of the lord ye 
kings of judah  and al l judah  and all 
the inhabitants of jerusalem  that enter 
in by these gates  21thus saith the lord 
take heed for the sake of your souls  
and bear no burden on the sabbath day  
nor bring it in by the gates of 
jerusalem  22neither carry forth a 
burden out o f your houses on the sabbath day  neither do ye any work  
but hallow ye the sabbath day  as i 
commanded your fathers  23but they 
hearkened not  neither inclined their 
ear but made their neck stiff  that they 
might not hear  nor receive instruction  
24and it shall come to pass  if ye 
diligently hearken unto me  saith the 
lord to bring in no burden through 
the gates of this city on the sabbath 
day but to hallow the sabbath day  to 
do no work therein  25then shall there 
enter in by the gates of this city ki ngs 
and princes sitting upon the throne of 
david  riding in chariots and on 
horses  they and their princes  the men 
of judah  and the inhabitants of 
jerusalem  and this city shall be 
inhabited for ever  26and they shall 
come from the cities of judah  and 
from the places round about 
jerusalem  and from the land of 
benjamin  and from the lowland  and 
from the mountains  and from the 
south  bringing burnt offerings  and 
sacrifices  and meal offerings  and 
frankincense  and bringing sacrifices 
of thanksgiving  unto the house of the 
lord 27but if ye will not hearken unto 
me to hallow the sabbath day  and not 
to bear a burden and enter in at the 
gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day  
then will i kindle a fire in the gates 
thereof  and it shall devour the palaces  
of jerusalem  and it shall not be 
quenched   
 
the word which came to 
jeremiah from the lord 18 jeremiah  
695 
 saying  2arise  and go down to the 
potter s house  and there i will cause 
thee to hear my words  3then i went 
down to the potter s house  and 
behold  he was  at his work on the 
wheels  4and whensoever the vessel 
that he made of the clay was marred in 
the hand of the potter  he made it again 
another vessel  as seemed good to the 
potter to make it   
5then the word of the lord came to 
me saying  6o house of isr ael cannot 
i do with you as this potter  saith the 
lord behold  as the clay in the 
potter s hand  so are ye in my hand  o 
house of israel  7at one instant i may 
speak concerning a nation  and 
concerning a kingdom  to pluck up and 
to break down and to des troy it  8but if 
that nation turn from their evil  
because of which i have spoken 
against it  i repent of the evil that i 
thought to do unto it  9and at one 
instant i may speak concerning a 
nation  and concerning a kingdom  to 
build and to plant it  10but if it do evil 
in my sight  that it hearken not to my 
voice  then i repent of the good  
wherewith i said i would benefit it  
11now therefore do thou speak to the 
men of judah  and to the inhabitants of 
jerusalem  saying  thus saith the 
lord behold  i frame  evil against you  
and devise a device against you  return 
ye now every one from his evil way  
and amend your ways and your doings  
12but they say  there is no hope  but 
we will walk after our own devices  and we will do every one after the 
stubbornness of  his evil heart   
 
13therefore thus saith the lord  
ask ye now among the nations   
who hath heard such things   
the virgin of israel hath done  
a very horrible thing   
14doth the snow of lebanon fail  
from the rock of the field   
or are the strange cold flowing 
waters  
plucked up   
15for my people hath forgotten me   
they offer unto vanity   
and they have been made to 
stumble in their ways   
in the ancient paths   
to walk in bypaths   
in a way not cast up   
16to make their land an 
astonishment   
and a per petual hissing   
every one that passeth thereby shall 
be astonished   
and shake his head   
17i will scatter them as with an east 
wind  
before the enemy   
i will look upon their back  and not 
their face   
in the day of their calamity   
 
18then said they   
come  and let us devise devices 
against jeremiah   
for instruction shall not perish from 
the priest   jeremiah  
696 
 nor counsel from the wise  nor the 
word from the prophet   
come  and let us smite him with the 
tongue   
and let us not give heed to any of 
his words   
19give heed to me  o lord  
and hearken to the voice of them 
that contend with me   
20shall evil be recompensed for 
good   
for they have digged a pit for my 
soul  
remember how i stood before thee  
to speak good for them   
to turn away thy wrath from them   
21therefore deliver up their children 
to the famine   
and hurl them to the power of the 
sword   
and let their wives be bereaved of 
their children  and widows   
and let their men be slain of death   
and their young men smitten of the 
sword in battle   
22let a cry be heard from their 
houses   
when thou shalt bring a troop 
suddenly upon them   
for they have digged a pit to take 
me  
and hid snares for my feet   
23yet lord thou knowest  
all their counsel against me to slay 
me  
forgive not their iniquity   
neither blot out their sin from thy 
sight   but let them be made to stumble 
before thee   
deal thou with them in the time of 
thine anger   
 
thus said the lord go and 
get a potter s earthen bottle  
and take of the elders of the people  
and of the elders of the priests  2and go 
forth unto the valley of the son of 
hinnom  which is by the entry of the 
gate harsith  and proclaim there the 
words that i shall tell thee  3and say  
hear ye the word of the lord o kings 
of judah  and inhabitants of jerusalem  
thus saith the lord of hosts  the god 
of israel   
behold  i will bring evil upon this 
place  which whosoever heareth  his 
ears shall tingle  4because they have 
forsaken me  and have estranged this 
place  and have offered in it unto other 
gods  whom neither the y nor their 
fathers have known  nor the kings of 
judah  and have filled this place with 
the blood of innocents  5and have built 
the high places of baal  to burn their 
sons in the fire for burnt offerings unto 
baal which i commanded not  nor 
spoke it  neither came it into my mind  
6therefore  behold  the days come  
saith the lord that this place shall no 
more be called topheth  nor the 
valley of the son of hinnom  but the 
valley of slaughter  7and i will make 
void the counsel of judah and 
jerusalem in this  place  and i will 
cause them to fall by the sword before 
their enemies  and by the hand of them 19 jeremiah  
697 
 that seek their life  and their carcasses 
will i give to be food for the fowls of 
the heaven  and for the beasts of the 
earth  8and i will make this city an 
astonishment  and a hissing  every one 
that passeth thereby shall be 
astonished and hiss because of all the 
plagues thereof  9and i will cause them 
to eat the flesh of their sons and the 
flesh of their daughters  and they shall 
eat every one the flesh of his  friend  in 
the siege and in the straitness  
wherewith their enemies  and they that 
seek their life  shall straiten them  
10then shalt thou break the bottle in 
the sight of the men that go with thee  
11and shalt say unto them  thus saith 
the lord of hosts  even so will i break 
this people and this city  as one 
breaketh a potter s vessel  that cannot 
be made whole again  and they shall 
bury in topheth  for want of room to 
bury 12thus will i do unto this place  
saith the lord and to the inhabitants 
thereof  even making this city as 
topheth  13and the houses of 
jerusalem  and the houses of the kings 
of judah  which are defiled  shall be as 
the place of topheth  even all the 
houses upon whose roofs they have 
offered unto all the host of heaven  and 
have poured  out drink offerings unto 
other gods   
 
14then came jeremiah from 
topheth  whither the lord had sent 
him to prophesy  and he stood in the 
court of the l ords house  and said to 
all the people  15thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i 
will bring upon this city and upon all 
her towns all the evil that i have 
pronounced against it  because they 
have made their neck stiff  that they 
might not hear my words   
now pashhur the son of 
immer the priest  who was 
chief officer in the house of the lord 
heard jeremiah prophesying these 
things  2then pashhur smote jeremiah 
the prophet  and put him in the stocks 
that were in the upper gate of 
benjamin  which was in the house of 
the lord 3and it came to pass on the 
morrow  that pashhur brought for th 
jeremiah out of the stocks  then said 
jeremiah unto him  the lord hath not 
called thy name pashhur  but 
amagormissabib  4for thus saith the 
lord behold  i will make thee a terror 
to thyself  and to all thy friends  and 
they shall fall by the sword of their 
enemies  and thine eyes shall behold it  
and i will give all judah into the hand 
of the king of babylon  and he shall 
carry them captive to babylon  and 
shall slay them with the sword  
5moreover i will give all the store of 
this city  and all the gai ns thereof  and 
all the wealth thereof  yea all the 
treasures of the kings of judah will i 
give into the hand of their enemies  
who shall spoil them  and take them  
and carry them to babylon  6and thou  
pashhur  and all that dwell in thy 
house shall go in to captivity  and thou 
                                                      
a that is terror on eve ry side  20 jeremiah  
698 
 shalt come to babylon  and there thou 
shalt die  and there shalt thou be 
buried  thou and all thy friends  to 
whom thou hast prophesied falsely   
 
7o lord thou hast enticed me  and 
i was enticed   
thou hast overcome me  and hast 
prevailed   
i am become a laughing stock all 
the day   
every one mocketh me   
8for as often as i speak  i cry out   
i cry violence and spoil   
because the word of the lord is 
made  
a reproach unto me  and a derision  
all the day   
9and if i say  i will not make 
mention of him   
nor speak any more in his name   
then there is in my heart as it were 
a burning fire  
shut up in my bones   
and i weary myself to hold it in   
but cannot   
10for i have heard the whispering of 
many   
terror on every side   
denou nce and we will denounce 
him  
even of all my familiar friends   
them that watch for my halting   
peradventure he will be enticed  
and we shall prevail against him   
and we shall take our revenge on 
him  
11but the lord is with me as a 
mighty warrior   therefore my persecutors shall 
stumble  and they shall not 
prevail   
they shall be greatly ashamed  
because they have not prospered   
even with an everlasting confusion 
which shall never be forgotten   
12but o lord of hosts  that triest the 
righteous   
that seest the reins and the heart   
let me see thy vengeance on them   
for unto thee have i revealed my 
cause   
 
13sing unto the lord  
praise ye the lord  
for he hath delivered the soul of the 
needy  
from the hand of evil doers   
 
14cursed be the day  
wherein i was born   
the day wherein my mother bore 
me  
let it not be blessed   
15cursed be the man who brought 
tidings  
to my father  saying   
a man child is born unto thee   
making him very glad   
16and let that man be as the cities  
which the lord overthrew  and 
repented not   
and let him hear a cry in the 
morning   
and an alarm at noontide   
17because he slew me not from the 
womb   jeremiah  
699 
 and so my mother would have been 
my grave   
and her womb always great   
18wherefore came i forth out of the 
womb  
to see l abour and sorrow   
that my days should be consumed 
in shame   
 
the word which came unto 
jeremiah from the lord when 
king zedekiah sent unto him pashhur 
the son of malchiah  and zephaniah 
the son of maaseiah the priest  saying  
2inquire  i pray thee  of the lord for 
us for nebuchadrezzar king of 
babylon maketh war against us  
peradventure the lord will deal with 
us according to all his wondrous 
works  that he may go up from us   
3then said jeremiah unto them  
thus shall ye say to zedekiah  4thus 
saith  the lord the god of israel   
behold  i will turn back the 
weapons of war that are in your hands  
wherewith ye fight against the king of 
babylon  and against the chaldeans  
that besiege you without the walls  and 
i will gather them into the midst of this 
city 5and i myself will fight against 
you with an outstretched hand and 
with a strong arm  even in anger  and 
in fury  and in great wrath  6and i will 
smite the inhabitants of this city  both 
man and beast  they shall die of a great 
pestilence  7and after ward  saith the 
lord i will deliver zedekiah king of 
judah  and his servants  and the 
people  and such as are left in this city from the pestilence  from the sword  
and from the famine  into the hand of 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and 
into the hand of  their enemies  and into 
the hand of those that seek their life  
and he shall smite them with the edge 
of the sword  he shall not spare them  
neither have pity  nor have 
compassion   
8and unto this people thou shalt say  
thus saith the lord behold  i set 
before you the way of life and the way 
of death  9he that abideth in this city 
shall die by the sword  and by the 
famine  and by the pestilence  but he 
that goeth out  and falleth away to the 
chaldeans that besiege you  he shall 
live and his life shall be  unto him for 
a prey  10for i have set my face 
against this city for evil  and not for 
good  saith the lord it shall be given 
into the hand of the king of babylon  
and he shall burn it with fire   
11and unto the house of the king of 
judah  hear ye the wor d of the lord 
12o house of david  thus saith the 
lord  
execute justice in the morning   
and deliver the spoiled out of the 
hand of the oppressor  
lest my fury go forth like fire   
and burn that none can quench it   
because of the evil of your doings   
 
13behold  i am against thee  o 
inhabitant of the valley   
and rock of the plain  saith the 
lord  21 jeremiah  
700 
 ye that say  who shall come down 
against us   
or who shall enter into our 
habitations   
14and i will punish you according to 
the fruit of your doings   
saith the lord  
and i will kindle a fire in her forest   
and it shall devour all that is round 
about her   
 
thus said the lord go down 
to the house of the king of 
judah  and speak there this word  2and 
say hear the word of the lord o king 
of judah  that sittest upon the throne of 
david  thou and thy servants  and thy 
people that enter in by these gates  
3thus saith the lord  
execute ye justice and 
righteousness  and deliver the spoiled 
out of the hand of the oppressor  and 
do no wrong  do no violence  to the 
stranger  the fatherless  nor the widow  
neither shed innocent blood in this 
place  4for if ye do this thing indeed  
then shall there enter in by the gates of 
this house kings sitting upon the 
throne of david  riding in chariots and 
on horses  he and his servants  and his 
people  5but if ye will not hear these 
words  i swear by myself  saith the 
lord that this house shall become a 
desolation  6for thus saith the lord 
concerning the house of the king of 
judah   
thou art gilead unto me   
the head of l ebanon   yet surely i will make thee a 
wilderness   
cities which are not inhabited   
7and i will prepare destroyers 
against thee   
every one with his weapons   
and they shall cut down thy choice 
cedars   
and cast them into the fire   
8and many nations shal l pass by this 
city and they shall say every man to 
his neighbour  wherefore hath the 
lord done thus unto this great city  
9then they shall answer  because 
they forsook the covenant of the lord 
their god  and worshipped other gods  
and served them   
 
10weep ye not for the dead   
neither bemoan him   
but weep sore for him that goeth 
away   
for he shall return no more   
nor see his native country   
11for thus saith the lord touching 
shallum the son of josiah  king of 
judah  who reigned instead of josiah 
his father  and who went forth out of 
this place  he shall not return thither 
any more  12but in the place whither 
they have led him captive  there shall 
he die  and he shall see this land no 
more   
 
13woe unto him that buildeth his 
house by unrighteousnes s  
and his chambers by injustice   
that useth his neighbour s service 
without wages   22 jeremiah  
701 
 and giveth him not his hire   
14that saith  i will build me a wide 
house  
and spacious chambers   
and cutteth him out windows   
and it is ceiled with cedar  and 
painte d with vermilion   
15shalt thou reign  because thou 
strivest to excel in cedar   
did not thy father eat and drink  and 
do justice and righteousness   
then it was well with him   
16he judged the cause of the poor 
and needy   
then it was well   
is not this t o know me  saith the 
lord  
17but thine eyes and thy heart  
are not but for thy covetousness   
and for shedding innocent blood   
and for oppression  and for 
violence  to do it   
18therefore thus saith the lord 
concerning jehoiakim the son of 
josiah  king o f judah   
they shall not lament for him   
ah my brother   or ah sister    
they shall not lament for him   
ah lord   or ah his glory    
19he shall be buried with the burial 
of an ass   
drawn and cast forth beyond the 
gates of jerusalem   
 
20go up to lebanon  and cry   
and lift up thy voice in bashan   
and cry from abarim   
for all thy lovers are destroyed   
21i spoke unto thee in thy prosperity   but thou saidst  i will not hear   
this hath been thy manner from thy 
youth   
that thou hearkenedst n ot to my 
voice   
22the wind shall feed upon all thy 
shepherds   
and thy lovers shall go into 
captivity   
surely then shalt thou be ashamed 
and confounded  
for all thy wickedness   
23o inhabitant of lebanon   
that art nestled in the cedars   
how gracious sh alt thou be when 
pangs come upon thee   
the pain as of a woman in travail   
24as i live  saith the lord though 
coniah the son of jehoiakim king of 
judah were the signet upon my right 
hand  yet would i pluck thee thence  
25and i will give thee into the han d of 
them that seek thy life  and into the 
hand of them of whom thou art afraid  
even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar 
king of babylon  and into the hand of 
the chaldeans  26and i will cast thee 
out and thy mother that bore thee  into 
another country  wher e ye were not 
born and there shall ye die  27but to 
the land whereunto they long to return  
thither shall they not return   
28is this man coniah a despised  
broken image   
is he a vessel wherein is no 
pleasure   
wherefore are they cast out  he and 
his see d  jeremiah  
702 
 and are cast into the land which 
they know not   
29o land  land land  
hear the word of the lord  
30thus saith the lord  
write ye this man childless   
a man that shall not prosper in his 
days  
for no man of his seed shall 
prosper   
sitting upon the  throne of david   
and ruling any more in judah   
 
woe unto the shepherds that 
 destroy and scatter  
the sheep of my pasture  saith the 
lord  
2therefore thus saith the lord the 
god of israel  against the shepherds 
that feed my people  ye have scattere d 
my flock  and driven them away  and 
have not taken care of them  behold  i 
will visit upon you the evil of your 
doings  saith the lord 3and i will 
gather the remnant of my flock out of 
all the countries whither i have driven 
them  and will bring them ba ck to their 
folds  and they shall be fruitful and 
multiply  4and i will set up shepherds 
over them  who shall feed them  and 
they shall fear no more  nor be 
dismayed  neither shall any be lacking  
saith the lord  
5behold  the days come  saith the 
lord that i will raise unto david 
a righteous shoot  and he shall 
reign as king and prosper  and 
shall execute justice and 
righteousness in the land   6in his days judah shall be saved  
and israel shall dwell safely  and 
this is his name whereby he shall 
be calle d the lord is our 
righteousness   
7therefore  behold  the days come  
saith the lord that they shall no more 
say as the lord liveth  that brought 
up the children of israel out of the land 
of egypt  8but as the lord liveth  
that brought up and that le d the seed of 
the house of israel out of the north 
country  and from all the countries 
whither i had driven them  and they 
shall dwell in their own land   
 
9concerning the prophets   
 
my heart within me is broken   
all my bones shake   
i am like a drunken  man  
and like a man whom wine hath 
overcome   
because of the lord  
and because of his holy words   
10for the land is full of adulterers   
for because of swearing the land 
mourneth   
the pastures of the wilderness are 
dried up   
and their course is evil   
and their force is not right   
11for both prophet and priest are 
ungodly   
yea in my house have i found their 
wickedness   
saith the lord  23 jeremiah  
703 
 12wherefore their way shall be unto 
them as slippery places in the 
darkness   
they shall be thrust  and fall 
therein  
for i will bring evil upon them   
even the year of their visitation   
saith the lord  
 
13and i have seen unseemliness in 
the prophets of samaria   
they prophesied by baal   
and caused my people israel to err   
14but in the prophets of jerusalem i 
have seen a horrible thing   
they commit adultery  and walk in 
lies  
and they strengthen the hands of 
evildoers   
that none doth return from his 
wickedness   
they are all of them become unto 
me as sodom   
and the inhabitants thereof as 
gomorrah   
15therefo re thus saith the lord of 
hosts concerning the prophets   
behold  i will feed them with 
wormwood   
and make them drink the water of 
gall  
for from the prophets of jerusalem  
is ungodliness gone forth into all the 
land  
 
16thus saith the lord of hosts   
hearken not unto the words of the 
prophets that prophesy unto you   
they lead you unto vanity   they speak a vision of their own 
heart   
and not out of the mouth of the 
lord  
17they say continually unto them 
that despise me   
the lord hath said  ye shall have 
peace   
and unto every one that walketh in 
the stubbornness of his own heart 
they say   
no evil shall come upon you   
18for who hath stood in the council 
of the lord  
that he should perceive and hear 
his word   
who hath attended to his word  and 
heard it   
 
19behold  a storm of the lord is 
gone forth in fury   
yea a whirling storm   
it shall whirl upon the head of the 
wicked   
20the anger of the lord shall not 
return   
until he have executed  and till he 
have performed the purposes of 
his heart   
iin the end of days ye shall consider 
it perfectly   
21i have not sent these prophets  yet 
they ran   
i have not spoken to them  yet they 
prophesied   
22but if they have stood in my 
council   
then let them cause my people to 
hear my words   jeremiah  
704 
 and turn them f rom their evil way   
and from the evil of their doings   
 
23am i a god near at hand  saith the 
lord  
and not a god afar off   
24can any hide himself in secret 
places  
that i shall not see him  saith the 
lord  
do not i fill heaven and earth   
saith the lord  
25i have heard what the prophets 
have said   
that prophesy lies in my name  
saying   
i have dreamed  i have dreamed   
26how long shall this be   
is it in the heart of the prophets that 
prophesy lies   
and the prophets of the deceit of 
their own hear t  
27that think to cause my people to 
forget my name  
by their dreams which they tell 
every man to his neighbour   
as their fathers forgot my name for 
baal  
28the prophet that hath a dream  let 
him tell a dream   
and he that hath my word  let him 
speak m y word faithfully   
what hath the straw to do with the 
wheat   
saith the lord  
29is not my word like as fire   
saith the lord  
and like a hammer that breaketh the 
rock in pieces   30therefore  behold  i am against the 
prophets  saith the lord that steal  my 
words every one from his neighbour  
31behold  i am against the prophets  
saith the lord that use there tongues 
and say  he saith  32behold  i am 
against them that prophesy lying 
dreams  saith the lord and do tell 
them  and cause my people to err by  
their lies  and by their wantonness  yet 
i sent them not  nor commanded them  
neither can they profit this people at 
all saith the lord  
33and when this people  or the 
prophet  or a priest  shall ask thee  
saying  what is the burden of the 
lord then shalt thou say unto them  
what burden  i will cast you off  saith 
the lord 34and as for the prophet  
and the priest  and the people  that 
shall say  the burden of the lord i 
will even punish that man and his 
house  35thus shall ye say every one to 
his neighbour  and every one to his 
brother  what hath the lord 
answered  and what hath the lord 
spoken  36and the burden of the lord 
shall ye mention no more  for every 
mans own word shall be his burden  
and would ye pervert the words of the 
living go d of the lord of hosts our 
god 37thus shalt thou say to the 
prophet  what hath the lord 
answered thee  and what hath the 
lord spoken  38but if ye say  the 
burden of the lord therefore thus 
saith the lord because ye say this 
word  the burden of the lord and i 
have sent unto you  saying  ye shall jeremiah  
705 
 not say  the burden of the lord 
39therefore  behold  i will utterly tear 
you out  and i will cast you off  and 
the city that i gave unto you and to 
your fathers  away from my presence  
40and i will b ring an everlasting 
reproach upon you  and a perpetual 
shame  which shall not be forgotten  
 
the lord showed me  and 
behold two baskets of figs set 
before the temple of the lord after 
that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon 
had carried away captive jeconiah  the 
son of jehoiakim  king of judah  and 
the princes of judah  with the 
craftsmen and smiths  from jerusalem  
and had brought them to babylon  
2one basket had very good figs  like 
the figs that are first ripe and the other 
basket had very bad figs  which  could 
not be eaten  they were so bad  3then 
said the lord unto me  what seest 
thou jeremiah  and i said  figs the 
good figs  very good  and the bad  very 
bad that cannot be eaten  they are so 
bad 4and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  5thus saith the lord 
the god of israel  like these good figs  
so will i regard the captives of judah  
whom i have sent out of this place into 
the land of the chaldeans  for good  
6and i will set mine eyes upon them 
for good  and i will bring them back to 
this land  and i will build them  and 
not pull them down  and i will plant 
them  and not pluck them up  7and i 
will give them a heart to know me  
that i am the lord and they shall be my people  and i will be their god  for 
they shall return unto me with the ir 
whole heart  8and as the bad figs  
which cannot be eaten  they are so 
bad surely thus saith the lord so will 
i make zedekiah the king of judah  
and his princes  and the residue of 
jerusalem  that remain in this land  and 
them that dwell in the land of  egypt  9i 
will even make them a horror among 
all the kingdoms of the earth for evil  a 
reproach and a proverb  a taunt and a 
curse  in all places whither i shall 
drive them  10and i will send the 
sword  the famine  and the pestilence  
among them  till the y be consumed 
from off the land that i gave unto them 
and to their fathers   
 
the word that came to 
jeremiah concerning all the 
people of judah in the fourth year of 
jehoiakim the son of josiah  king of 
judah  that was the first year of 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  
2which jeremiah the prophet spoke 
unto all the people of judah  and to all 
the inhabitants of jerusalem  saying   
3from the thirteenth year of josiah 
the son of amon  king of judah  even 
unto this day  these three and twenty 
years  the wor d of the lord hath come 
unto me  and i have spoken unto you  
speaking betimes and often  but ye 
have not hearkened  4and the lord 
hath sent unto you all his servants the 
prophets  sending them betimes and 
often but ye have not hearkened  nor 
inclined your ear to hear  5saying  24 
25 jeremiah  
706 
 return ye now every one from his 
evil way  and from the evil of your 
doings  and dwell in the land that the 
lord hath given unto you and to your 
fathers  for ever and ever  6and go not 
after other gods to serve them  and to 
worship t hem and provoke me not 
with the work of your hands  and i will 
do you no hurt  7yet ye have not 
hearkened unto me  saith the lord 
that ye might provoke me with the 
work of your hands to your own hurt  
8therefore thus saith the lord of 
hosts  because ye have not heard my 
words  9behold  i will send and take all 
the families of the north  saith the 
lord and i will send unto 
nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon  
my servant  and will bring them 
against this land  and against the 
inhabitants thereof  and again st all 
these nations round about  and i will 
utterly destroy them  and make them 
an astonishment  and a hissing  and 
perpetual desolations  10moreover i 
will cause to cease from among them 
the voice of mirth and the voice of 
gladness  the voice of the brid egroom 
and the voice of the bride  the sound of 
the millstones  and the light of the 
lamp  11and this whole land shall be a 
desolation  and a waste  and these 
nations shall serve the king of babylon 
seventy years  12and it shall come to 
pass when seventy years are 
accomplished  that i will punish the 
king of babylon  and that nation  saith 
the lord for their iniquity  and the 
land of the chaldeans  and i will make it perpetual desolations  13and i will 
bring upon that land all my words 
which i have pronou nced against it  
even all that is written in this book  
which jeremiah hath prophesied 
against all the nations  14for many 
nations and great kings shall make 
bondmen of them also  and i will 
recompense them according to their 
deeds  and according to the wo rk of 
their own hands   
15for thus saith the lord the god of 
israel  unto me  take this cup of the 
wine of fury at my hand  and cause all 
the nations  to whom i send thee  to 
drink it  16and they shall drink  and 
reel to and fro  and be like madmen  
becau se of the sword that i will send 
among them 17then took i the cup 
of the l ords hand  and made all the 
nations to drink  unto whom the lord 
had sent me  18jerusalem  and the 
cities of judah  and the kings thereof  
and the princes thereof  to make them 
an appalment  an astonishment  a 
hissing  and a curse  as it is this day  
19pharaoh king of egypt  and his 
servants  and his princes  and all his 
people  20and all the mingled people  
and all the kings of the land of uz  and 
all the kings of the land of the 
philistines  and ashkelon  and gaza  
and ekron  and the remnant of 
ashdod  21edom  and moab  and the 
children of ammon  22and all the kings 
of tyre  and all the kings of zidon  
and the kings of the isle which is 
beyond the sea  23dedan  and tema  
and buz  and all that have the corners jeremiah  
707 
 of their hair polled  24and all the kings 
of arabia  and all the kings of the 
mingled people that dwell in the 
wilderness  25and all the kings of 
zimri  and all the kings of elam  and 
all the kings of the medes  26and all the 
kings of the north  far and near  one 
with another  and all the kingdoms of 
the world  which are upon the face of 
the earth and the king of asheshach 
shall drink after them  27and thou shalt 
say unto them  thus saith the lord of 
hosts  the god of israel  drink ye  and 
be drunken  and spew  and fall  and 
rise no more  because of the sword 
which i will send among you  28and it 
shall be  if they refuse to take the cup 
at thy hand to drink  then shalt thou 
say unto them  thus saith the lord of 
hosts  ye shall s urely drink  29for lo i 
begin to bring evil on the city 
whereupon my name is called  and 
should ye be utterly unpunished  ye 
shall not be unpunished  for i will call 
for a sword upon all the inhabitants of 
the earth  saith the lord of hosts   
30therefore  prophesy thou against 
them all these words  and say unto 
them   
the lord doth roar from on high   
and utter his voice from his holy 
habitation   
he doth mightily roar because of 
his fold   
he giveth a shout  as they that tread 
the grapes   
                                                      
a according to ancient tradition a 
cipher for babel  against all the  inhabitants of the 
earth   
31a noise is come even to the end of 
the earth   
for the lord hath a controversy 
with the nations   
he doth plead with all flesh   
as for the wicked  he hath given 
them to the sword   
saith the lord  
 
32thus saith the lord of hosts  
behold  evil shall go forth  
from nation to nation   
and a great storm shall be raised up  
from the uttermost parts of the 
earth   
33and the slain of the lord shall be at 
that day from one end of the earth 
even unto the other end of the earth  
they shall not be lamented  neither 
gathered  nor buried  they shall be 
dung upon the face of the ground   
34wail  ye shepherds  and cry   
and wallow yourselves in the dust  
ye leaders of the flock   
for the days of your slaughter are 
fully come   
and i will br eak you in pieces   
and ye shall fall like a precious 
vessel   
35and the shepherds shall have no 
way to flee   
nor the leaders of the flock to 
escape   
36hark  the cry of the shepherds   
and the wailing of the leaders of the 
flock   jeremiah  
708 
 for the lord despoileth  their 
pasture   
37and the peaceable folds are 
brought to silence  
because of the fierce anger of the 
lord  
38he hath forsaken his covert  as the 
lion  
for their land is become a waste  
because of the fierceness of the 
oppressing sword   
and because of h is fierce anger   
 
in the beginning of the reign 
of jehoiakim the son of josiah  
king of judah  came this word from 
the lord saying  2thus saith the 
lord stand in the court of the l ords 
house  and speak unto all the cities of 
judah  which come to wo rship in the 
lords house  all the words that i 
command thee to speak unto them  
diminish not a word  3it may be they 
will hearken  and turn every man from 
his evil way  that i may repent me of 
the evil  which i purpose to do unto 
them because of the evil of their 
doings  4and thou shalt say unto them  
thus saith the lord if ye will not 
hearken to me  to walk in my law  
which i have set before you  5to 
hearken to the words of my servants 
the prophets  whom i send unto you  
even sending them betimes and oft en 
but ye have not hearkened  6then will i 
make this house like shiloh  and will 
make this city a curse to all the nations 
of the earth   7so the priests and the prophets and 
all the people heard jeremiah speaking 
these words in the house of the lord 
8now it came to pass  when jeremiah 
had made an end of speaking all that 
the lord had commanded him to speak 
unto all the people  that the priests and 
the prophets and all the people laid 
hold on him  saying  thou shalt 
surely die  9why hast thou prophesied  
in the name of the lord saying  this 
house shall be like shiloh  and this city 
shall be desolate  without an 
inhabitant  and all the people were 
gathered against jeremiah in the house 
of the lord  
10when the princes of judah heard 
these things  they ca me up from the 
kings house unto the house of the 
lord and they sat in the entry of the 
new gate of the l ords house  11then 
spoke the priests and the prophets unto 
the princes and to all the people  
saying  this man is worthy of death  
for he hath proph esied against this 
city as ye have heard with your ears  
12then spoke jeremiah unto all the 
princes and to all the people  saying  
the lord sent me to prophesy against 
this house and against this city all the 
words that ye have heard  13therefore 
now am end your ways and your 
doings  and hearken to the voice of the 
lord your god  and the lord will 
repent him of the evil that he hath 
pronounced against you  14but as for 
me behold  i am in your hand  do with 
me as is good and right in your eyes  
15only kno w ye for certain that  if ye 26 jeremiah  
709 
 put me to death  ye will bring innocent 
blood upon yourselves  and upon this 
city and upon the inhabitants thereof  
for of a truth the lord hath sent me 
unto you to speak all these words in 
your ears   
16then said the princes  and all the 
people unto the priests and to the 
prophets  this man is not worthy of 
death  for he hath spoken to us in the 
name of the lord our god  17then 
rose up certain of the elders of the 
land and spoke to all the assembly of 
the people  saying  18micah the 
morashtite prophesied in the days of 
hezekiah king of judah  and he spoke 
to all the people of judah  saying  
thus saith the lord of hosts   
zion shall be plowed as a field   
and jerusalem shall become heaps   
and the mountain of the house as 
the high places of a forest   
19did hezekiah king of judah and all 
judah put him at all to death  did he 
not fear the lord and entreat the 
favour of the lord and the lord 
repented him of the evil which he had 
pronounced against them  thus might 
we procure great evil against our own 
souls   
20and there was also a man that 
prophesied in the name of the lord 
uriah the son of shemaiah of kiriath 
jearim  and he prophesied against this 
city and against this land according to 
all the words of jeremiah  21and whe n 
jehoiakim the king  with all his mighty 
men and all the princes  heard his 
words  the king sought to put him to death  but when uriah heard it  he was 
afraid  and fled  and went into egypt  
22and jehoiakim the king sent men into 
egypt  elnathan the son of achbor  
and certain men with him  into egypt  
23and they fetched forth uriah out of 
egypt  and brought him unto 
jehoiakim the king  who slew him 
with the sword  and cast his dead body 
into the graves of the children of the 
people  24nevertheless the han d of 
ahikam the son of shaphan was with 
jeremiah  that they should not give 
him into the hand of the people to put 
him to death   
 
in the beginning of the reign 
of jehoiakim the son of josiah  
king of judah  came this word unto 
jeremiah from the lord saying  
2thus saith the lord to me  make 
thee bands and bars  and put them 
upon thy neck  3and send them to the 
king of edom  and to the king of 
moab  and to the king of the children 
of ammon  and to the king of tyre  
and to the king of zidon  by the hand 
of the messengers that come to 
jerusalem unto zedekiah king of 
judah  4and give them a charge unto 
their masters  saying  thus saith the 
lord of hosts  the god of israel  thus 
shall ye say unto your masters  5i have 
made the earth  the man and the beast 
that are upon the face of the earth  by 
my great power and by my 
outstretched arm  and i give it unto 
whom it seemeth right unto me  6and 
now have i given all these lands into 27 jeremiah  
710 
 the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king 
of babylon  my servant  and the beasts 
of the field also have i given him to 
serve him  7and all the nations shall 
serve him  and his son  and his son s 
son until the time of his own land 
come  and then many nations and great 
kings shall make him their bondman  
8and it shall come to pass  that the 
nation and the kingdom which will not 
serve the same nebuchadnezzar king 
of babylon  and that will not put their 
neck under the yoke of the king of 
babylon  that nation will i visit  saith 
the lord with the sword  and with the 
famine  and with the pestilenc e until i 
have consumed them by his hand  9but 
as for you  hearken ye not to your 
prophets  nor to your diviners  nor to 
your dreams  nor to your soothsayers  
nor to your sorcerers  that speak unto 
you saying  ye shall not serve the 
king of babylon  10for they prophesy a 
lie unto you  to remove you far from 
your land  and that i should drive you 
out and ye should perish  11but the 
nation that shall bring their neck under 
the yoke of the king of babylon  and 
serve him  that nation will i let remain 
in thei r own land  saith the lord and 
they shall till it  and dwell therein   
12and i spoke to zedekiah king of 
judah according to all these words  
saying  bring your necks under the 
yoke of the king of babylon  and serve 
him and his people  and live  13why 
will ye die  thou and thy people  by the 
sword  by the famine  and by the 
pestilence  as the lord hath spoken concerning the nation that will not 
serve the king of babylon  14and 
hearken not unto the words of the 
prophets that speak unto you  saying  
ye shal l not serve the king of babylon  
for they prophesy a lie unto you  15for 
i have not sent them  saith the lord 
and they prophesy falsely in my name  
that i might drive you out  and that ye 
might perish  ye and the prophets that 
prophesy unto you   
16also  i spoke to the priests and to 
all this people  saying  thus saith the 
lord hearken not to the words of 
your prophets that prophesy unto you  
saying  behold  the vessels of the 
lords house shall now shortly be 
brought back from babylon  for they 
prophes y a lie unto you  17hearken not 
unto them  serve the king of babylon  
and live  wherefore should this city 
become desolate  18but if they be 
prophets  and if the word of the lord 
be with them  let them now make 
intercession to the lord of hosts  that 
the v essels which are left in the house 
of the lord and in the house of the 
king of judah  and at jerusalem  go not 
to babylon  19for thus saith the lord 
of hosts concerning the pillars  and 
concerning the sea  and concerning the 
bases  and concerning the resi due of 
the vessels that remain in this city  
20which nebuchadnezzar king of 
babylon took not  when he carried 
away captive jeconiah the son of 
jehoiakim  king of judah  from 
jerusalem to babylon  and all the 
nobles of judah and jerusalem  21yea jeremiah  
711 
 thus saith  the lord of hosts  the god 
of israel  concerning the vessels that 
remain in the house of the lord and in 
the house of the king of judah  and at 
jerusalem  22they shall be carried to 
babylon  and there shall they be  until 
the day that i remember them  saith the 
lord and bring them up  and restore 
them to this place   
and it came to pass the same 
year in the beginning of the 
reign of zedekiah king of judah  in the 
fourth year  in the fifth month  that 
hananiah the son of azzur the 
prophet  who was of  gibeon  spoke 
unto me in the house of the lord in 
the presence of the priests and of all 
the people  saying  2thus speaketh the 
lord of hosts  the god of israel  
saying  i have broken the yoke of the 
king of babylon  3within two full 
years will i bring back into this place 
all the vessels of the l ords house  
that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon 
took away from this place  and carried 
them to babylon  4and i will bring 
back to this place jeconiah the son of 
jehoiakim  king of judah  with all the 
captives o f judah  that went to 
babylon  saith the lord for i will 
break the yoke of the king of 
babylon  5then the prophet jeremiah 
said unto the prophet hananiah in the 
presence of the priests  and in the 
presence of all the people that stood in 
the house of the  lord 6even the 
prophet jeremiah said  amen  the 
lord do so  the lord perform thy 
words which thou hast prophesied  to bring back the vessels of the l ords 
house  and all them that are carried 
away captive  from babylon unto this 
place  7nevertheless hea r thou now 
this word that i speak in thine ears  and 
in the ears of all the people  8the 
prophets that have been before me and 
before thee of old prophesied against 
many countries  and against great 
kingdoms  of war  and of evil  and of 
pestilence  9the pr ophet that 
prophesieth of peace  when the word 
of the prophet shall come to pass  then 
shall the prophet be known  that the 
lord hath truly sent him   
10then hananiah the prophet took 
the bar from off the prophet 
jeremiah s neck  and broke it  11and 
hanan iah spoke in the presence of all 
the people  saying  thus saith the 
lord even so will i break the yoke of 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from 
off the neck of all the nations within 
two full years  and the prophet 
jeremiah went his way  12then the 
word o f the lord came unto jeremiah  
after that hananiah the prophet had 
broken the bar from off the neck of the 
prophet jeremiah  saying  13go and 
tell hananiah  saying  thus saith the 
lord thou hast broken the bars of 
wood  but thou shalt make in their 
stead bars of iron  14for thus saith the 
lord of hosts  the god of israel  i have 
put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all 
these nations  that they may serve 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and 
they shall serve him  and i have given 
him the beasts of the field also 28 jeremiah  
712 
 15then said the prophet jeremiah unto 
hananiah the prophet  hear now  
hananiah  the lord hath not sent thee  
but thou makest this people to trust in 
a lie 16therefore thus saith the lord 
behold  i will send thee away from off 
the face of the ear th this year thou 
shalt die  because thou hast spoken 
perversion against the lord 17so 
hananiah the prophet died the same 
year in the seventh month   
now these are the words of the 
letter that jeremiah the prophet 
sent from jerusalem unto the residue  
of the elders of the captivity  and to the 
priests  and to the prophets  and to all 
the people  whom nebuchadnezzar 
had carried away captive from 
jerusalem to babylon  2after that 
jeconiah the king  and the queen 
mother  and the officers  and the 
princes of judah and jerusalem  and 
the craftsmen  and the smiths  were 
departed from jerusalem  3by the hand 
of elasah the son of shaphan  and 
gemariah the son of hilkiah  whom 
zedekiah king of judah sent unto 
babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of 
babylon  saying   
4thus saith the lord of hosts  the 
god of israel  unto all the captivity  
whom i have caused to be carried 
away captive from jerusalem unto 
babylon   
5build ye houses  and dwell in them  
and plant gardens  and eat the fruit of 
them  6take ye wives  and bege t sons 
and daughters  and take wives for your 
sons and give your daughters to husbands  that they may bear sons and 
daughters  and multiply ye there  and 
be not diminished  7and seek the 
peace of the city whither i have caused 
you to be carried away capti ve and 
pray unto the lord for it  for in the 
peace thereof shall ye have peace   
8for thus saith the lord of hosts  the 
god of israel  let not your prophets 
that are in the midst of you  and your 
diviners  beguile you  neither hearken 
ye to your dreams wh ich ye cause to 
be dreamed  9for they prophesy falsely 
unto you in my name  i have not sent 
them  saith the lord  
10for thus saith the lord after 
seventy years are accomplished for 
babylon  i will remember you  and 
perform my good word toward you  in 
causing you to return to this place  
11for i know the thoughts that i think 
toward you  saith the lord thoughts of 
peace  and not of evil  to give you a 
future and a hope  12and ye shall call 
upon me  and go  and pray unto me  
and i will hearken unto you  13and ye 
shall seek me  and find me  when ye 
shall search for me with all your heart  
14and i will be found of you  saith the 
lord and i will turn your captivity  
and gather you from all the nations  
and from all the places whither i have 
driven you  saith the lord and i will 
bring you back unto the place whence 
i caused you to be carried away 
captive  15for ye have said  the lord 
hath raised us up prophets in babylon  
16for thus saith the lord concerning 
the king that sitteth upon the throne of 29 jeremiah  
713 
 david  and concerning all the people 
that dwell in this city  your brethren 
that are not gone forth with you into 
captivity  17thus saith the lord of 
hosts  behold  i will send upon them 
the sword  the famine  and the 
pestilence  and will make them like 
vile figs  that cannot be eaten  they are 
so bad  18and i will pursue after them 
with the sword  with the famine  and 
with the pestilence  and will make 
them a horror unto all the kingdoms of 
the earth  a curse  and an astonishment  
and a hissing  and a reproach  among 
all the nations whither i have driven 
them  19because they have not 
hearkened to my words  saith the 
lord wherewith i sent unto them my 
servants the prophets  sending them 
betimes and often  but ye would not 
hear saith the lord 20hear ye 
therefore th e word of the lord all ye 
of the captivity  whom i have sent 
away from jerusalem to babylon  
21thus saith the lord of hosts  the god 
of israel  concerning ahab the son of 
kolaiah  and concerning zedekiah the 
son of maaseiah  who prophesy a lie 
unto you in  my name  behold  i will 
deliver them into the hand of 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and 
he shall slay them before your eyes  
22and of them shall be taken up a curse 
by all the captivity of judah that are in 
babylon  saying  the lord make thee 
like zede kiah and like ahab  whom 
the king of babylon roasted in the 
fire 23because they have wrought vile 
deeds in israel  and have committed adultery with their neighbours wives  
and have spoken words in my name 
falsely  which i commanded them not  
but i am he that knoweth  and am 
witness  saith the lord  
24and concerning shemaiah the 
nehelamite thou shalt speak  saying  
25thus speaketh the lord of hosts  the 
god of israel  saying  because thou 
hast sent letters in thine own name 
unto all the people that are at  
jerusalem  and to zephaniah the son of 
maaseiah the priest  and to all the 
priests  saying  26the lord hath made 
thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the 
priest  that there should be officers in 
the house of the lord for every man 
that is mad  and maketh  himself a 
prophet  that thou shouldest put him in 
the stocks and in the collar  27now 
therefore  why hast thou not rebuked 
jeremiah of anathoth  who maketh 
himself a prophet to you  28forasmuch 
as he hath sent unto us in babylon  
saying  the captivity is long build ye 
houses  and dwell in them  and plant 
gardens  and eat the fruit of them  
29and zephaniah the priest read this 
letter in the ears of jeremiah the 
prophet  30then came the word of the 
lord unto jeremiah  saying  31send to 
all them of the capt ivity saying  thus 
saith the lord concerning shemaiah 
the nehelamite  because that 
shemaiah hath prophesied unto you  
and i sent him not  and he hath caused 
you to trust in a lie  32therefore thus 
saith the lord behold  i will punish 
shemaiah the nehelam ite and his jeremiah  
714 
 seed he shall not have a man to dwell 
among this people  neither shall he 
behold the good that i will do unto my 
people  saith the lord because he hath 
spoken perversion against the lord  
 
the word that came to 
jeremiah from the lord 
saying 2thus speaketh the lord the 
god of israel  saying  write thee all 
the words that i have spoken unto thee 
in a book  3for lo the days come  
saith the lord that i will turn the 
captivity of my people israel and 
judah  saith the lord and i will ca use 
them to return to the land that i gave to 
their fathers  and they shall possess it   
4and these are the words that the 
lord spoke concerning israel and 
concerning judah  5for thus saith the 
lord  
we have heard a voice of trembling   
of fear  and not of peace   
6ask ye now  and see whether a man 
doth travail with child   
wherefore do i see every man  
with his hands on his loins  as a 
woman in travail   
and all faces are turned into 
paleness   
7alas for that day is great   
so that none is like it   
and it is a time of trouble unto 
jacob   
but out of it shall he be saved   
8and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
saith the lord of hosts   that i will break his yoke from off 
thy neck   
and will burst thy bands   
and strangers shall no more make 
him their bondman   
9but they shall serve the lord their 
god  
and david their king   
whom i will raise up unto them   
 
10therefore fear thou not  o jacob 
my servant  saith the lord  
neither be dismayed  o israel   
for lo i will save thee from afar   
and thy seed  from the land of their 
captivity   
and jacob shall again be quiet and 
at ease   
and none shall make him afraid   
11for i am with thee  saith the lord 
to save thee   
for i will make a full end of all the 
nations whither i have scattered 
thee  
but i will not make a full end of 
thee  
for i will correct thee in measure   
and will not utterly destroy thee   
 
12for thus saith the lord  
thy hurt is incurable   
and thy wound is grievous   
13none deemeth of thy wound that it 
may be bound up   
thou hast no heali ng medicines   
14all thy lovers have forgotten thee   
they seek thee not   
for i have wounded thee with the 
wound of an enemy   30 jeremiah  
715 
 with the chastisement of a cruel 
one  
for the greatness of thine iniquity   
because thy sins were increased   
15why criest thou  for thy hurt   
that thy pain is incurable   
for the greatness of thine iniquity  
because thy sins were increased   
i have done these things unto thee   
16therefore all they that devour thee 
shall be devoured   
and all thine adversaries  every one 
of them  shall go into captivity   
and they that spoil thee shall be a 
spoil   
and all that prey upon thee will i 
give for a prey   
17for i will restore health unto thee   
and i will heal thee of thy wounds  
saith the lord  
because they have called thee an 
outcas t  
she is azion  there is none that 
careth for her   
 
18thus saith the lord  
behold  i will turn the captivity of 
jacob s tents   
and have compassion on his 
dwelling places   
and the city shall be builded upon 
her own mound   
and the palace shall be in habited 
upon its wonted place   
19and out of them shall proceed 
thanksgiving  
                                                      
a with a play on the meaning a dry 
land and the voice of them that make 
merry   
and i will multiply them  and they 
shall not be diminished   
i will also increase them  and they 
shall not dwindle away   
20their children  also shall be as 
aforetime   
and their congregation shall be 
established before me   
and i will punish all that oppress 
them   
21and their prince shall be of 
themselves   
and their ruler shall proceed from 
the midst of them   
and i will cause him to draw near 
and he shall approach unto me   
for who is he that hath pledged his 
heart  
to approach unto me  saith the 
lord  
22and ye shall be my people  and i 
will be your god   
 
23behold  a storm of the lord is 
gone forth in fury   
a sweeping storm  it shall w hirl 
upon the head of the wicked   
24the fierce anger of the lord shall 
not return   
until he have executed  and till he 
have performed  
the purposes of his heart   
in the end of days ye shall consider 
it  
at that time  saith the lord  
will i be the g od of all the  
    families of israel   31 jeremiah  
716 
  and they shall be my people   
 
2thus saith the lord  
the people that were left of the 
sword  
have found grace in the wilderness   
even israel  when i go to cause him 
to rest   
3from afar the lord appeared unto 
me  
yea i have loved thee with an 
everlasting love   
therefore with affection have i 
drawn thee   
4again will i build thee  and thou 
shalt be built   
o virgin of israel   
again shalt thou be adorned with 
thy tabrets   
and shalt go forth in the dances of 
them that make merry   
5again shalt thou plant vineyards 
upon the mountains of samaria   
the planters shall plant  and shall 
have the use thereof   
6for there shall be a day   
that the watchmen shall call upon 
the mount ephraim   
arise ye  and let us go up to zion   
unto the lord our god   
 
7for thus saith the lord  
sing with gladness for jacob   
and shout at the head of the nations   
announce ye  praise ye  and say   
o lord save thy people   
the remnant of israel   
8behold  i will bring them from the 
north country   and gather them from the uttermost 
parts of the earth   
and with them the blind and the 
lame   
the woman with child and her that 
travaileth with child together   
a great company shall they return 
hither   
9they shall come with weeping   
and with supplications will i lead 
them   
i will cause them to walk by rivers 
of waters   
in a straight way wherein they shall 
not stumble   
for i am become a father to israel   
and ephraim is my first born  
 
10hear the word of the lord o ye 
nations   
and de clare it in the isles afar off  
and say   
he that scattered israel doth gather 
him  
and keep him  as a shepherd doth 
his flock   
11for the lord hath ransomed jacob   
and he redeemeth him from the 
hand of him that is stronger than 
he  
12and they shall c ome and sing in 
the height of zion   
and shall flow unto the goodness of 
the lord  
to the corn  and to the wine  and to 
the oil   
and to the young of the flock and of 
the herd   jeremiah  
717 
 and their soul shall be as a watered 
garden   
and they shall not pine any mor e at 
all  
13then shall the virgin rejoice in the 
dance   
and the young men and the old 
together   
for i will turn their mourning into 
joy  
and will comfort them  and make 
them rejoice from their sorrow   
14and i will satiate the soul of the 
priests with fatness   
and my people shall be satisfied 
with my goodness   
saith the lord  
 
15thus saith the lord  
a voice is heard in ramah   
lamentation  and bitter weeping   
rachel weeping for her children   
she refuseth to be comforted for her 
children   
because they are not   
 
16thus saith the lord  
refrain thy voice from weeping   
and thine eyes from tears   
for thy work shall be rewarded  
saith the lord  
and they shall come back from the 
land of the enemy   
17and there is hope for thy future  
saith the lord  
and thy children shall return to their 
own border   
18i have surely heard ephraim 
bemoaning himself   thou hast chastised me  and i was 
chastised   
as a calf untrained   
turn thou me  and i shall be turned   
for thou art the lord my god   
19surely after that i was turned  i 
repented   
and after that i was instructed  i 
smote upon my thigh   
i was ashamed  yea even 
confounded   
because i did bear the reproach of 
my youth   
20is ephraim a darling son unto me   
is he a child that is dandled   
for as often as i speak of him   
i do earnestly remember him still   
therefore my heart yearneth for 
him  
i will surely have compassion upon 
him saith the lord  
 
21set thee up waymarks   
make thee guide posts   
set thy heart toward the high way  
even the way by whi ch thou 
wentest   
return  o virgin of israel   
return to these thy cities   
22how long wilt thou turn away 
coyly   
o thou backsliding daughter   
for the lord hath created a new 
thing in the earth   
a woman shall court a man   
 
23thus saith the lord of host s the 
god of israel   
yet again shall they use this speech  jeremiah  
718 
 in the land of judah and in the cities 
thereof   
when i shall turn their captivity   
the lord bless thee  o habitation 
of righteousness   
o mountain of holiness   
24and judah and all the cities  
thereof  
shall dwell therein together   
the husbandmen  and they that go 
forth with flocks   
25for i have satiated the weary soul   
and every pining soul have i 
replenished   
 
26upon this i awaked  and beheld   
and my sleep was sweet unto me   
 
27behold  the days come  saith the 
lord that i will sow the house of 
israel and the house of judah with the 
seed of man  and with the seed of 
beast  28and it shall come to pass  that 
like as i have watched over them to 
pluck up and to break down  and to 
overthrow a nd to destroy  and to 
afflict  so will i watch over them to 
build and to plant  saith the lord  
29in those days they shall say no 
more   
the fathers have eaten sour grapes   
and the children s teeth are set on 
   edge   
30but every one shall die for his  own 
iniquity  every man that eateth the sour 
grapes  his teeth shall be set on edge   
31behold  the days come  saith the 
lord that i will make a new covenant 
with the house of israel  and with the house of judah  32not according to the 
covenant that i ma de with their fathers 
in the day that i took them by the hand 
to bring them out of the land of egypt  
forasmuch as they broke my covenant  
although i was a lord over them  saith 
the lord 33but this is the covenant 
that i will make with the house of 
israel  after those days  saith the lord 
i will put my law in their inward parts  
and in their heart will i write it  and i 
will be their god  and they shall be my 
people  34and they shall teach no more 
every man his neighbour  and every 
man his brother  saying  know the 
lord for they shall all know me  
from the least of them unto the greatest 
of them  saith the lord for i will 
forgive their iniquity  and their sin will 
i remember no more   
 
35thus saith the lord  
who giveth the sun for a light by 
day  
and the ordinances of the moon and 
of the stars for a light by night   
who stirreth up the sea  that the 
waves thereof roar   
the lord of hosts is his name   
36if these ordinances depart from 
before me   
saith the lord  
then the seed of israel also shall 
cease  
from being a nation before me for 
ever  
 
37thus saith the lord  
if heaven above can be measured   jeremiah  
719 
 and the foundations of the earth 
searched out beneath   
then will i also cast off all the seed 
of israel  
for all that they have done  saith the 
lord  
38behold  the days come  saith the 
lord that the city shall be built to the 
lord from the tower of hananel unto 
the gate of the corner  39and the 
measuring line shall yet go out straight 
forward unto the hill gareb  and shall 
turn about unto goah  40and th e whole 
valley of the dead bodies  and of the 
ashes  and all the fields unto the brook 
kidron  unto the corner of the horse 
gate toward the east  shall be holy unto 
the lord it shall not be plucked up  
nor thrown down any more for ever   
 
the word that  came to 
jeremiah from the lord in the 
tenth year of zedekiah king of judah  
which was the eighteenth year of 
nebuchadrezzar  2now at that time the 
king of babylon s army was besieging 
jerusalem  and jeremiah the prophet 
was shut up in the court of the gua rd 
which was in the king of judah s 
house  3for zedekiah king of judah 
had shut him up  saying  wherefore 
dost thou prophesy  and say  thus 
saith the lord behold  i will give this 
city into the hand of the king of 
babylon  and he shall take it  4and 
zedekiah king of judah shall not 
escape out of the hand of the 
chaldeans  but shall surely be 
delivered into the hand of the king of babylon  and shall speak with him 
mouth to mouth  and his eyes shall 
behold his eyes  5and he shall lead 
zedekiah to babylon  and there shall 
he be until i remember him  saith the 
lord though ye fight with the 
chaldeans  ye shall not prosper   
6and jeremiah said  the word of 
the lord came unto me  saying  
7behold  hanamel  the son of shallum 
thine uncle  shall come unto thee  
saying  buy thee my field that is in 
anathoth  for the right of redemption 
is thine to buy it  8so hanamel mine 
uncle s son came to me in the court of 
the guard according to the word of the 
lord and said unto me  buy my 
field i pray thee  that is in an athoth  
which is in the land of benjamin  for 
the right of inheritance is thine  and 
the redemption is thine  buy it for 
thyself  then i knew that this was the 
word of the lord 9and i bought the 
field that was in anathoth of hanamel 
mine uncle s son  and weighed him the 
money  even seventeen shekels of 
silver  10and i subscribed the deed  
and sealed it  and called witnesses  and 
weighed him the money in the 
balances  11so i took the deed of the 
purchase  both that which was sealed  
containing the terms an d conditions  
and that which was open  12and i 
delivered the deed of the purchase 
unto baruch the son of neriah  the son 
of mahseiah  in the  presence of 
hanamel mine uncle s son  and in 
the presence of the witnesses that 
subscribed the deed of the purcha se 32 jeremiah  
720 
 before all the jews that sat in the court 
of the guard  13and i charged baruch 
before them  saying  14thus saith the 
lord of hosts  the god of israel  take 
these deeds  this deed of the purchase  
both that which is sealed  and this deed 
which is open  and put them in an 
earthen vessel  that they may continue 
many days  15for thus saith the lord 
of hosts  the god of israel  houses and 
fields and vineyards shall yet again be 
bought in this land   
16now after i had delivered the deed 
of the purchase unto  baruch the son of 
neriah  i prayed unto the lord saying  
17ah lord g od behold  thou hast 
made the heaven and the earth by thy 
great power and by thy outstretched 
arm there is nothing too hard for 
thee  18who showest mercy unto 
thousands  and recompens est the 
iniquity of the fathers into the bosom 
of their children after them  the great  
the mighty god  the lord of hosts is 
his name  19great in counsel  and 
mighty in work  whose eyes are open 
upon all the ways of the sons of men  
to give every one accor ding to his 
ways  and according to the fruit of his 
doings  20who didst set signs and 
wonders in the land of egypt  even 
unto this day  and in israel and among 
other men  and madest thee a name  
as at this day  21and didst bring forth 
thy people israel out  of the land of 
egypt with signs  and with wonders  
and with a strong hand  and with an 
outstretched arm  and with great terror  
22and gavest them this land  which thou didst swear to their fathers to 
give them  a land flowing with milk 
and honey  23and th ey came in  and 
possessed it  but they hearkened not to 
thy voice  neither walked in thy law  
they have done nothing of all that 
thou commandedst them to do  
therefore thou hast caused all this evil 
to befall them  24behold the mounds  
they are come unto t he city to take it  
and the city is given into the hand of 
the chaldeans that fight against it  
because of the sword  and of the 
famine  and of the pestilence  and what 
thou hast spoken is come to pass  and 
behold  thou seest it  25yet thou hast 
said unto  me o lord g od buy thee 
the field for money  and call witnesses  
whereas the city is given into the hand 
of the chaldeans   
26then came the word of the lord 
unto jeremiah  saying  27behold  i am 
the lord the god of all flesh  is there 
any thing too ha rd for me  28therefore 
thus saith the lord behold  i will give 
this city into the hand of the 
chaldeans  and into the hand of 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and 
he shall take it  29and the chaldeans  
that fight against this city  shall come 
and set this city on fire  and burn it  
with the houses  upon whose roofs 
they have offered unto baal  and 
poured out drink offerings unto other 
gods  to provoke me  30for the 
children of israel and the children of 
judah have only done that which was 
evil in my sight f rom their youth  for 
the children of israel have only jeremiah  
721 
 provoked me with the work of their 
hands  saith the lord 31for this city 
hath been to me a provocation of mine 
anger and of my fury from the day that 
they built it even unto this day  that i 
should rem ove it from before my face  
32because of all the evil of the children 
of israel and of the children of judah  
which they have done to provoke me  
they their kings  their princes  their 
priests  and their prophets  and the 
men of judah  and the inhabitants  of 
jerusalem  33and they have turned 
unto me the back  and not the face  
and though i taught them  teaching 
them betimes and often  yet they have 
not hearkened to receive instruction  
34but they set their abominations in the 
house whereupon my name is cal led 
to defile it  35and they built the high 
places of baal  which are in the valley 
of the son of hinnom  to set apart their 
sons and their daughters unto molech  
which i commanded them not  neither 
came it into my mind  that they should 
do this abominati on to cause judah to 
sin 36and now therefore thus saith the 
lord the god of israel  concerning 
this city  whereof ye say  it is given 
into the hand of the king of babylon 
by the sword  and by the famine  and 
by the pestilence  37behold  i will 
gather th em out of all the countries  
whither i have driven them in mine 
anger  and in my fury  and in great 
wrath  and i will bring them back unto 
this place  and i will cause them to 
dwell safely  38and they shall be my 
people  and i will be their god  39and i will give them one heart and one way  
that they may fear me for ever  for the 
good of them  and of their children 
after them  40and i will make an 
everlasting covenant with them  that i 
will not turn away from them  to do 
them good  and i will put my fear in  
their hearts  that they shall not depart 
from me  41yea i will rejoice over 
them to do them good  and i will plant 
them in this land in truth with my 
whole heart and with my whole soul  
42for thus saith the lord like as i 
have brought all this great evi l upon 
this people  so will i bring upon them 
all the good that i have promised them  
43and fields shall be bought in this 
land whereof ye say  it is desolate  
without man or beast  it is given into 
the hand of the chaldeans  44men shall 
buy fields for mo ney and subscribe 
the deeds  and seal them  and call 
witnesses  in the land of benjamin  
and in the places about jerusalem  and 
in the cities of judah  and in the cities 
of the hill country  and in the cities of 
the lowland  and in the cities of the 
south  for i will cause their captivity 
to return  saith the lord  
moreover the word of the 
lord came unto jeremiah the 
second time  while he was yet shut up 
in the court of the guard  saying   
2thus saith the lord the maker 
thereof   
the lord that formed it to establish 
it  
the lord is his name   33 jeremiah  
722 
 3call unto me  and i will answer 
thee  
and will tell thee great things  and 
hidden  which thou knowest not   
4for thus saith the lord the god of 
israel  concerning the houses of this 
city and concerning the ho uses of the 
kings of judah  which are broken 
down for mounds  and for ramparts  
5whereon they come to fight with the 
chaldeans  even to fill them with the 
dead bodies of men  whom i have slain 
in mine anger and in my fury  and for 
all whose wickedness i ha ve hid my 
face from this city  6behold  i will 
bring it healing and cure  and i will 
cure them  and i will reveal unto them 
the abundance of peace and truth  
7and i will cause the captivity of 
judah and the captivity of israel to 
return  and will build the m as at the 
first 8and i will cleanse them from all 
their iniquity  whereby they have 
sinned against me  and i will pardon 
all their iniquities  whereby they have 
sinned against me  and whereby they 
have transgressed against me  9and 
this city shall be t o me for a name of 
joy for a praise and for a glory  before 
all the nations of the earth  which shall 
hear all the good that i do unto them  
and shall fear and tremble for all the 
good and for all the peace that i 
procure unto it   
10thus saith the lord yet again 
there shall be heard in this place  
whereof ye say  it is waste  without 
man and without beast  even in the 
cities of judah  and in the streets of jerusalem  that are desolate  without 
man and without inhabitant and 
without beast  11the voice of joy and 
the voice of gladness  the voice of the 
bridegroom and the voice of the bride  
the voice of them that say  give 
thanks to the lord of hosts  for the 
lord is good  for his mercy endureth 
for ever  even of them that bring 
offerings of thanksgiving into the 
house of the lord for i will cause the 
captivity of the land to return as at the 
first saith the lord  
12thus saith the lord of hosts  yet 
again shall there be in this place  
which is waste  without man and 
without beast  and in all the cities 
thereof  a habitation of shepherds 
causing their flocks to lie down  13in 
the cities of the hill country  in the 
cities of the lowland  and in the cities 
of the south  and in the land of 
benjamin  and in the places about 
jerusalem  and in the cities of jud ah 
shall the flocks again pass under the 
hands of him that counteth them  saith 
the lord  
14behold  the days come  saith the 
lord that i will perform that good 
word which i have spoken concerning 
the house of israel and concerning the 
house of judah  15in those days  and at 
that time   
will i cause a shoot of righteousness 
to grow up unto david   
and he shall execute justice and 
righteousness in the land   
16in those days shall judah be saved   
and jerusalem shall dwell safely   jeremiah  
723 
 and this is the name wher eby she 
shall be called   
the lord is our righteousness   
17for thus saith the lord there 
shall not be cut off unto david a man 
to sit upon the throne of the house of 
israel  18neither shall there be cut off 
unto the priests the levites a man 
before me to  offer burnt offerings  and 
to burn meal offerings  and to do 
sacrifice continually   
19and the word of the lord came 
unto jeremiah  saying  20thus saith the 
lord  
if ye can break my covenant with 
the day   
and my covenant with the night   
so that there s hould not be day and 
night in their season   
21then may also my covenant be 
broken with david my servant   
that he should not have a son to 
reign upon his throne   
and with the levites the priests  my 
ministers   
22as the host of heaven cannot be 
numbered   
neither the sand of the sea 
measured   
so will i multiply the seed of david 
my servant   
and the levites that minister unto 
me  
23and the word of the lord came to 
jeremiah  saying  24considerest thou 
not what this people have spoken  
saying  the two fa milies which the 
lord did choose  he hath cast them 
off and they contemn my people  that they should be no more a nation before 
them  25thus saith the lord if my 
covenant be not with day and night  if 
i have not appointed the ordinances of 
heaven and ear th 26then will i also 
cast away the seed of jacob  and of 
david my servant  so that i will not 
take of his seed to be rulers over the 
seed of abraham  isaac  and jacob  for 
i will cause their captivity to return  
and will have compassion on them   
 
the word which came unto 
jeremiah from the lord when 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and 
all his army  and all the kingdoms of 
the land of his dominion  and all the 
peoples  fought against jerusalem  and 
against all the cities thereof  saying   
2thus saith the lord the god of 
israel  go and speak to zedekiah king 
of judah  and tell him  thus saith the 
lord behold  i will give this city into 
the hand of the king of babylon  and 
he shall burn it with fire  3and thou 
shalt not escape out of his hand  but 
shalt surely be taken  and delivered 
into his hand  and thine eyes shall 
behold the eyes of the king of 
babylon  and he shall speak with thee 
mouth to mouth  and thou shalt go to 
babylon  4yet hear the word of the 
lord o zedekiah king of judah  thus 
saith th e lord concerning thee  thou 
shalt not die by the sword  5thou shalt 
die in peace  and with the burnings of 
thy fathers  the former kings that were 
before thee  so shall they make a 
burning for thee  and they shall lament 34 jeremiah  
724 
 thee ah lord   for i have spoke n the 
word  saith the lord  
6then jeremiah the prophet spoke 
all these words unto zedekiah king of 
judah in jerusalem  7when the king of 
babylon s army fought against 
jerusalem  and against all the cities of 
judah that were left  against lachish 
and again st azekah  for these alone 
remained of the cities of judah as 
fortified cities   
8the word that came unto jeremiah 
from the lord after that the king 
zedekiah had made a covenant with all 
the people that were at jerusalem  to 
proclaim liberty unto them  9that every 
man should let his manservant  and 
every man his maidservant  being a 
hebrew man or a hebrew woman  go 
free that none should make bondmen 
of them  even of a jew his brother  
10and all the princes and all the people 
hearkened  that had entered in to the 
covenant to let every one his man 
servant  and every one his maid 
servant  go free  and not to make 
bondmen of them any more  they 
hearkened  and let them go  11but 
afterwards they turned  and caused the 
servants and the handmaids  whom 
they had let  go free  to return  and 
brought them into subjection for 
servants and for handmaids  
12therefore the word of the lord came 
to jeremiah from the lord saying   
13thus saith the lord the god of 
israel  i made a covenant with your 
fathers in the day that i brought them 
forth out of the land of egypt  out of the house of bondage  saying  14at the 
end of seven years ye shall let go 
every man his brother that is a 
hebrew  that hath been sold unto thee  
and hath served thee six years  thou 
shalt let him go free  from thee  but 
your fathers hearkened not unto me  
neither inclined their ear  15and ye 
were now turned  and had done that 
which is right in mine eyes  in 
proclaiming liberty every man to his 
neighbour  and ye had made a 
covenant before me in the house 
whereon my name is called  16but ye 
turned and profaned my name  and 
caused every man his servant  and 
every man his handmaid  whom ye had 
let go free at their pleasure  to return  
and ye brought them into subjection  to 
be unto you for servants and for 
handmaids  17therefore thus saith the 
lord ye have not hearkened unto me  
to proclaim liberty  every man to his 
brother  and every man to his 
neighbour  behold  i proclaim for you 
a liberty  saith the lord unto the 
sword  unto the pestilence  and unto 
the f amine  and i will make you a 
horror unto all the kingdoms of the 
earth  18and i will give the men that 
have transgressed my covenant  that 
have not performed the words of the 
covenant which they made before me  
when they cut the calf in twain and 
passed be tween the parts thereof  19the 
princes of judah  and the princes of 
jerusalem  the officers  and the priests  
and all the people of the land  that 
passed between the parts of the calf  jeremiah  
725 
 20i will even give them into the hand of 
their enemies  and into the ha nd of 
them that seek their life  and their dead 
bodies shall be for food unto the fowls 
of the heaven  and to the beasts of the 
earth  21and zedekiah king of judah 
and his princes will i give into the 
hand of their enemies  and into the 
hand of them that s eek their life  and 
into the hand of the king of babylon s 
army  that are gone up from you  
22behold  i will command  saith the 
lord and cause them to return to this 
city and they shall fight against it  and 
take it  and burn it with fire  and i will 
make the cities of judah a desolation  
without inhabitant   
the word which came unto 
jeremiah from the lord in the 
days of jehoiakim the son of josiah  
king of judah  saying  2go unto the 
house of the rechabites  and speak 
unto them  and bring them into t he 
house of the lord into one of the 
chambers  and give them wine to 
drink  3then i took jaazaniah the son 
of jeremiah  the son of habazziniah  
and his brethren  and all his sons  and 
the whole house of the rechabites  
4and i brought them into the house of 
the lord into the chamber of the sons 
of hanan the son of igdaliah  the man 
of god  which was by the chamber of 
the princes  which was above the 
chamber of maaseiah the son of 
shallum  the keeper of the door  5and i 
set before the sons of the house of the 
rechabites goblets full of wine  and 
cups and i said unto them  drink ye wine  6but they said  we will drink 
no wine  for jonadab the son of 
rechab our father commanded us  
saying  ye shall drink no wine  neither 
ye nor your sons  for ever  7neith er 
shall ye build house  nor sow seed  nor 
plant vineyard  nor have any  but all 
your days ye shall dwell in tents  that 
ye may live many days in the land 
wherein ye sojourn  8and we have 
hearkened to the voice of jonadab the 
son of rechab our father in al l that he 
charged us  to drink no wine all our 
days we our wives  our sons  nor our 
daughters  9nor to build houses for us 
to dwell in  neither to have vineyard  
or field  or seed  10but we have dwelt 
in tents  and have hearkened  and done 
according to a ll that jonadab our father 
commanded us  11but it came to pass  
when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon 
came up against the land  that we said  
come  and let us go to jerusalem for 
fear of the army of the chaldeans  and 
for fear of the army of the arameans  
so we dwell at jerusalem   
12then came the word of the lord 
unto jeremiah  saying  13thus saith 
the lord of hosts  the god of israel  
go and say to the men of judah and 
the inhabitants of jerusalem  will ye 
not receive instruction to hearken to 
my words  saith the lord 14the 
words of jonadab the son of rechab  
that he commanded his sons  not to 
drink wine  are performed  and unto 
this day they drink none  for they 
hearken to their father s 
commandment  but i have spoken unto 35 jeremiah  
726 
 you speaking betimes and ofte n and 
ye have not hearkened unto me  15i 
have sent also unto you all my 
servants the prophets  sending them 
betimes and often  saying  return ye 
now every man from his evil way  and 
amend your doings  and go not after 
other gods to serve them  and ye shal l 
dwell in the land which i have given to 
you and to your fathers  but ye have 
not inclined your ear  nor hearkened 
unto me  16because the sons of 
jonadab the son of rechab have 
performed the commandment of their 
father which he commanded them  but 
this pe ople hath not hearkened unto 
me 17therefore thus saith the lord the 
god of hosts  the god of israel  
behold  i will bring upon judah and 
upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem 
all the evil that i have pronounced 
against them  because i have spoken 
unto th em but they have not heard  
and i have called unto them  but they 
have not answered   
18and unto the house of the 
rechabites jeremiah said  thus saith 
the lord of hosts  the god of israel  
because ye have hearkened to the 
commandment of jonadab your fath er 
and kept all his precepts  and done 
according unto all that he commanded 
you 19therefore thus saith the lord of 
hosts  the god of israel  there shall 
not be cut off unto jonadab the son of 
rechab a man to stand before me for 
ever  
 and it came to  pass in the 
fourth year of jehoiakim the 
son of josiah  king of judah  that this 
word came unto jeremiah from the 
lord saying  2take thee a roll of a 
book  and write therein all the words 
that i have spoken unto thee against 
israel  and against judah  and against 
all the nations  from the day i spoke 
unto thee  from the days of josiah  
even unto this day  3it may be that the 
house of judah will hear all the evil 
which i purpose to do unto them  that 
they may return every man from his 
evil way  and i may forgive their 
iniquity and their sin   
4then jeremiah called baruch the 
son of neriah  and baruch wrote from 
the mouth of jeremiah all the words of 
the lord which he had spoken unto 
him upon a roll of a book  5and 
jeremiah commanded baruch  saying  
i am detained  i cannot go into the 
house of the lord 6therefore go thou  
and read in the roll  which thou hast 
written from my mouth  the words of 
the lord in the ears of the people in 
the l ords house upon a fast day and 
also thou shalt read them in the e ars of 
all judah that come out of their cities  
7it may be they will present their 
supplication before the lord and will 
return every one from his evil way  for 
great is the anger and the fury that the 
lord hath pronounced against this 
people  8and baruc h the son of 
neriah did according to all that 
jeremiah the prophet commanded him  36 jeremiah  
727 
 reading in the book the words of the 
lord in the l ords house   
9now it came to pass in the fifth 
year of jehoiakim the son of josiah  
king of judah  in the ninth month  that 
they proclaimed a fast before the lord 
all the people in jerusalem  and all the 
people that came from the cities of 
judah unto jerusalem  10then did 
baruch read in the book the words of 
jeremiah in the house of the lord in 
the chamber of gemariah the so n of 
shaphan the scribe  in the upper court  
at the entry of the new gate of the 
lords house  in the ears of all the 
people  11and when micaiah the son of 
gemariah  the son of shaphan  had 
heard out of the book all the words of 
the lord 12he went down in to the 
kings house  into the scribe s 
chamber  and lo all the princes sat 
there  even elishama the scribe  and 
delaiah the son of shemaiah  and 
elnathan the son of achbor  and 
gemariah the son of shaphan  and 
zedekiah the son of hananiah  and all 
the pr inces  13then micaiah declared 
unto them all the words that he had 
heard  when baruch read the book in 
the ears of the people  14therefore all 
the princes sent jehudi the son of 
nethaniah  the son of shelemiah  the 
son of cushi  unto baruch  saying  
take in thy hand the roll wherein thou 
hast read in the ears of the people  and 
come  so baruch the son of neriah 
took the roll in his hand  and came 
unto them  15and they said unto him  
sit down now  and read it in our ears  so baruch read it in their ears  16now 
it came to pass  when they had heard 
all the words  they turned in fear one 
toward another  and said unto baruch  
we will surely tell the king of all 
these words  17and they asked 
baruch  saying  tell us now  how 
didst thou write all these words at his 
mouth  18then baruch answered 
them  he pronounced all these words 
unto me with his mouth  and i wrote 
them with ink in the book  19then said 
the princes unto baruch  go hide 
thee thou and jeremiah  and let no 
man know where ye are  20and they  
went in to the king into the court  but 
they had deposited the roll in the 
chamber of elishama the scribe  and 
they told all the words in the ears of 
the king  21so the king sent jehudi to 
fetch the roll  and he took it out of the 
chamber of elishama the scribe  and 
jehudi read it in the ears of the king  
and in the ears of all the princes that 
stood beside the king  22now the king 
was sitting in the winter house in the 
ninth month  and the brazier was 
burning before him  23and it came to 
pass when jehudi  had read three or 
four columns  that he cut it with the 
penknife  and cast it into the fire that 
was in the brazier  until all the roll was 
consumed in the fire that was in the 
brazier  24yet they were not afraid  nor 
rent their garments  neither the king  
nor any of his servants that heard all 
these words  25moreover elnathan and 
delaiah and gemariah had entreated 
the king not to burn the roll  but he jeremiah  
728 
 would not hear them  26and the king 
commanded jerahmeel the king s son  
and seraiah the son of azriel  and 
shelemiah the son of abdeel  to take 
baruch the scribe and jeremiah the 
prophet  but the lord hid them   
27then the word of the lord came to 
jeremiah  after that the king had 
burned the roll  and the words which 
baruch wrote at the mouth of 
jeremiah  saying 28take thee again 
another roll  and write in it all the 
former words that were in the first roll  
which jehoiakim the king of judah 
hath burned  29and concerning 
jehoiakim king of judah thou shalt 
say thus saith the lord thou hast 
burned this roll  saying  why hast thou 
written therein  saying  the king of 
babylon shall certainly come and 
destroy this land  and shall cause to 
cease from thence man and beast  
30therefore thus saith the lord 
concerning jehoiakim king of judah  
he shall have none to si t upon the 
throne of david  and his dead body 
shall be cast out in the day to the heat  
and in the night to the frost  31and i 
will visit upon him and his seed and 
his servants their iniquity  and i will 
bring upon them  and upon the 
inhabitants of jerusal em and upon the 
men of judah  all the evil that i have 
pronounced against them  but they 
hearkened not   
32then took jeremiah another roll  
and gave it to baruch the scribe  the 
son of neriah  who wrote therein from 
the mouth of jeremiah all the words of  the book which jehoiakim king of 
judah had burned in the fire  and there 
were added besides unto them many 
like words   
 
and zedekiah the son of 
josiah reigned as king  instead 
of coniah the son of jehoiakim  whom 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made 
king in the land of judah  2but neither 
he nor his servants  nor the people of 
the land  did hearken unto the words of 
the lord which he spoke by the 
prophet jeremiah   
3and zedekiah the king sent jehucal 
the son of shelemiah  and zephaniah 
the son of maas eiah the priest  to the 
prophet jeremiah  saying  pray now 
unto the lord our god for us  4now 
jeremiah came in and went out among 
the people  for they had not put him 
into prison  5and pharaoh s army was 
come forth out of egypt  and when the 
chaldeans th at besieged jerusalem 
heard tidings of them  they broke up 
from jerusalem  6then came the word 
of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah  
saying  7thus saith the lord the god 
of israel  thus shall ye say to the king 
of judah  that sent you unto me to 
inquire  of me  behold  pharaoh s 
army  which is come forth to help you  
shall return to egypt into their own 
land 8and the chaldeans shall return  
and fight against this city  and they 
shall take it  and burn it with fire  
9thus saith the lord deceive not 
yours elves  saying  the chaldeans 
shall surely depart from us  for they 37 jeremiah  
729 
 shall not depart  10for though ye had 
smitten the whole army of the 
chaldeans that fight against you  and 
there remained but wounded men 
among them  yet would they rise up 
every man in his tent and burn this 
city with fire   
11and it came to pass  that when the 
army of the chaldeans was broken up 
from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh s 
army  12then jeremiah went forth out 
of jerusalem to go into the land of 
benjamin  to receive his portion th ere 
in the midst of the people  13and when 
he was in the gate of benjamin  a 
captain of the ward was there  whose 
name was irijah  the son of shelemiah  
the son of hananiah  and he laid hold 
on jeremiah the prophet  saying  
thou fallest away to the chald eans 
14then said jeremiah  it is false  i fall 
not away to the chaldeans  but he 
hearkened not to him  so irijah laid 
hold on jeremiah  and brought him to 
the princes  15and the princes were 
wroth with jeremiah  and smote him  
and put him in prison in the house of 
jonathan the scribe  for they had made 
that the prison   
16when jeremiah was come into the 
dungeon house  and into the cells  and 
jeremiah had remained there many 
days 17then zedekiah the king sent  
and fetched him  and the king asked 
him sec retly in his house  and said  is 
there any word from the lord and 
jeremiah said  there is  he said also  
thou shalt be delivered into the hand 
of the king of babylon  18moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah  
wherein have i sinned against thee  or 
against thy servants  or against this 
people  that ye have put me in prison  
19where now are your prophets that 
prophesied unto you  saying  the king 
of babylon shall not come against you  
nor against this land  20and now hear  
i pray thee  o my lord th e king  let my 
supplication  i pray thee  be presented 
before thee  that thou cause me not to 
return to the house of jonathan the 
scribe  lest i die there  21then 
zedekiah the king commanded  and 
they committed jeremiah into the court 
of the guard  and th ey gave him daily a 
loaf of bread out of the bakers street  
until all the bread in the city was spent  
thus jeremiah remained in the court 
of the guard   
and shephatiah the son of 
mattan  and gedaliah the son 
of pashhur  and jucal the son of 
shelemiah  and pashhur the son of 
malchiah  heard the words that 
jeremiah spoke unto all the people  
saying  2thus saith the lord he that 
remaineth in this city shall die by the 
sword  by the famine  and by the 
pestilence  but he that goeth forth to 
the chaldeans s hall live  and his life 
shall be unto him for a prey  and he 
shall live  3thus saith the lord this 
city shall surely be given into the hand 
of the army of the king of babylon  
and he shall take it  4then the princes 
said unto the king  let this man  we 
pray thee  be put to death  forasmuch 
as he weakeneth the hands of the men 38 jeremiah  
730 
 of war that remain in this city  and the 
hands of all the people  in speaking 
such words unto them  for this man 
seeketh not the welfare of this people  
but the hurt  5then zedekia h the king 
said behold  he is in your hand  for 
the king is not he that can do any thing 
against you  6then took they 
jeremiah  and cast him into the pit of 
malchiah the king s son  that was in 
the court of the guard  and they let 
down jeremiah with cor ds and in the 
pit there was no water  but mire  and 
jeremiah sank in the mire   
7now when ebed melech the 
ethiopian  an officer  who was in the 
kings house  heard that they had put 
jeremiah in the pit  the king then 
sitting in the gate of benjamin  8ebed 
melech went forth out of the king s 
house  and spoke to the king  saying  
9my lord the king  these men have 
done evil in all that they have done to 
jeremiah the prophet  whom they have 
cast into the pit  and he is like to die in 
the place where he is bec ause of the 
famine  for there is no more bread in 
the city  10then the king commanded 
ebed melech the ethiopian  saying  
take from hence thirty men with thee  
and take up jeremiah the prophet out 
of the pit  before he die  11so ebed 
melech took the men with him  and 
went into the house of the king under 
the treasury  and took thence worn 
clouts and worn rags  and let them 
down by cords into the pit to jeremiah  
12and ebed melech the ethiopian said 
unto jeremiah  put now these worn clouts and rags under thine armholes 
under the cords  and jeremiah did so  
13so they drew up jeremiah with the 
cords  and took him up out of the pit  
and jeremiah remained in the court of 
the guard   
14then zedekiah the king sent  and 
took jeremiah the prophet unto him 
into th e third entry that was in the 
house of the lord and the king said 
unto jeremiah  i will ask thee a thing  
hide nothing from me  15then 
jeremiah said unto zedekiah  if i 
declare it unto thee  wilt thou not 
surely put me to death  and if i give 
thee coun sel thou wilt not hearken 
unto me  16so zedekiah the king 
swore secretly unto jeremiah  saying  
as the lord liveth  that made us this 
soul i will not put thee to death  
neither will i give thee into the hand of 
these men that seek thy life   
17then sa id jeremiah unto zedekiah  
thus saith the lord the god of hosts  
the god of israel  if thou wilt go forth 
unto the king of babylon s princes  
then thy soul shall live  and this city 
shall not be burned with fire  and thou 
shalt live  thou and thy house  18but if 
thou wilt not go forth to the king of 
babylon s princes  then shall this city 
be given into the hand of the 
chaldeans  and they shall burn it with 
fire and thou shalt not escape out of 
their hand  19and zedekiah the king 
said unto jeremiah  i am afraid of the 
jews that are fallen away to the 
chaldeans  lest they deliver me into 
their hand  and they mock me  20but jeremiah  
731 
 jeremiah said  they shall not deliver 
thee hearken  i beseech thee  to the 
voice of the lord in that which i 
speak unto thee  so it shall be well 
with thee  and thy soul shall live  21but 
if thou refuse to go forth  this is the 
word that the lord hath shown me  
22behold  all the women that are left in 
the king of judah s house shall be 
brought forth to the king of babylon s 
princes  and those women shall say   
thy familiar friends have set thee 
on  
and have prevailed over thee   
thy feet are sunk in the mire   
and they are turned away back   
23and they shall bring out all thy 
wives and thy children to the 
chaldeans  and thou shalt n ot escape 
out of their hand  but shalt be taken by 
the hand of the king of babylon  and 
thou shalt cause this city to be burned 
with fire   
24then said zedekiah unto jeremiah  
let no man know of these words  and 
thou shalt not die  25but if the princes 
hear that i have talked with thee  and 
they come unto thee  and say unto 
thee declare unto us now what thou 
hast said unto the king  hide it not 
from us  and we will not put thee to 
death  also what the king said unto 
thee 26then thou shalt say unto them  i 
presented my supplication before the 
king that he would not cause me to 
return to jonathan s house  to die 
there  27then came all the princes 
unto jeremiah  and asked him  and he 
told them according to all these words that the king had commanded  so they 
left off speaking with him  for the 
matter was not reported  28so jeremiah 
abode in the court of the guard until 
the day that jerusalem was taken   
and it came to pass  when  
jerusalem was taken 1in the 
ninth year of zedekiah king of 
judah  in the t enth month  came 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and 
all his army against jerusalem  and 
besieged it  2in the eleventh year of 
zedekiah  in the fourth month  the 
ninth day of the month  a breach was 
made in the city  3that all the princes 
of the king of bab ylon came in  and 
sat in the middle gate  even nergal 
sarezer  samgar nebo  sarsechim 
arabsaris nergal sarezer arabmag 
with all the residue of the princes of 
the king of babylon  4and it came to 
pass that when zedekiah the king of 
judah and all the me n of war saw 
them  then they fled  and went forth 
out of the city by night  by the way of 
the king s garden  by the gate betwixt 
the two walls  and he went out the way 
of the arabah  5but the army of the 
chaldeans pursued after them  and 
overtook zedekiah in the plains of 
jericho  and when they had taken him  
they brought him up to 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon to 
riblah in the land of hamath  and he 
gave judgment upon him  6then the 
king of babylon slew the sons of 
zedekiah in riblah before his eyes  
                                                      
a titles of officers  39 jeremiah  
732 
 also the king of babylon slew all the 
nobles of judah  7moreover he put out 
zedekiah s eyes  and bound him in 
fetters  to carry him to babylon  8and 
the chaldeans burned the king s 
house  and the house of the people  
with fire  and broke down the walls of 
jerusalem  9then nebuzaradan the 
captain of the guard carried away 
captive into babylon the remnant of 
the people that remained in the city  
the deserters also  that fell away to 
him with the rest of the people that 
remained  10but nebuzaradan the 
captain of the guard left of the poor of 
the people  that had nothing  in the 
land of judah  and gave them 
vineyards and fields in that day  11now 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave 
charge concerning jeremiah to 
nebuzaradan the captain of the guard  
saying  12take him and look well to 
him and do him no harm  but do unto 
him even as he shall say unto thee  
13so nebuzaradan the captain of the 
guard sent  and nebushazban rab 
saris and nergal sarezer rab mag 
and all the chief officers of the king of 
babylon  14they sent and took 
jeremiah out of the court of the guard  
and committed him unto gedaliah the 
son of ahikam  the son of shaphan  
that he should carry him home  so he 
dwelt among the people   
15now the word of the lord came 
unto jeremiah  while he was shut up  in 
the court of the guard  saying  16go 
and speak to ebed melech the 
ethiopian  saying  thus saith the lord of hosts  the god of israel  behold  i 
will bring my words upon this city for 
evil and not for good  and they shall 
be accomplished before thee in that 
day 17but i will deliver thee in that 
day saith the lord and thou shalt not 
be given into the hand of the men of 
whom thou art afraid  18for i will 
surely deliver thee  and thou shalt not 
fall by the sword  but thy life shall be 
for a prey unto thee because thou hast 
put thy trust in me  saith the lord  
 
the word which came to 
jeremiah from the lord after 
that nebuzaradan the captain of the 
guard had let him go from ramah  
when he had taken him being bound in 
chains among all the captives of 
jerusalem and judah  that were carried 
away captive unto babylon  2and the 
captain of the guard took jeremiah  
and said unto him  the lord thy god 
pronounced this evil upon this place  
3and the lord hath brought it  and 
done according as he spoke  because 
ye have sinned against the lord and 
have not hearkened to his voice  
therefore this thing is come upon you  
4and now  behold  i loose thee this 
day from the chains which are upon 
thy hand  if it seem good unto thee to 
come with me into babylon  come  
and i will look well unto thee  but if it 
seem ill unto thee to come with me 
into babylon  forbear  behold  all the 
land is before thee  whither it seemeth 
good and right unto thee to go  thither 
go5yet he would not go back go 40 jeremiah  
733 
 back then to gedaliah the son of 
ahikam  the son of shaphan  whom 
the king of babylon hath made 
governor over the cities of judah  and 
dwell with him among the people  or 
go wheresoever it seemeth right unto 
thee to go  so the captain of the guard 
gave him an allowance and a prese nt 
and let him go  6then went jeremiah 
unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to 
mizpah  and dwelt with him among 
the people that were left in the land   
7now when all the captains of the 
forces that were in the fields  even 
they and their men  heard that the ki ng 
of babylon had made gedaliah the son 
of ahikam governor in the land  and 
had committed unto him men  and 
women  and children  and of the 
poorest of the land  of them that were 
not carried away captive to babylon  
8then they came to gedaliah to 
mizpah  even ishmael the son of 
nethaniah  and johanan and jonathan 
the sons of kareah  and seraiah the 
son of tanhumeth  and the sons of 
ephai the netophathite  and jezaniah 
the son of the maacathite  they and 
their men  9and gedaliah the son of 
ahikam the son of shaphan swore 
unto them and to their men  saying  
fear not to serve the chaldeans  dwell 
in the land  and serve the king of 
babylon  and it shall be well with you  
10as for me  behold  i will dwell at 
mizpah  to stand before the chaldeans 
that may come un to us  but ye  gather 
ye wine and summer fruits and oil  and 
put them in your vessels  and dwell in your cities that ye have taken  
11likewise when all the jews that were 
in moab  and among the children of 
ammon  and in edom  and that were 
in all the coun tries heard that the king 
of babylon had left a remnant of 
judah  and that he had set over them 
gedaliah the son of ahikam  the son 
of shaphan  12then all the jews 
returned out of all places whither they 
were driven  and came to the land of 
judah  to geda liah unto mizpah  and 
gathered wine and summer fruits in 
great abundance   
13moreover johanan the son of 
kareah  and all the captains of the 
forces that were in the fields  came to 
gedaliah to mizpah  14and said unto 
him dost thou know that baalis the 
king of the children of ammon hath 
sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to 
take thy life  but gedaliah the son of 
ahikam believed them not  15then 
johanan the son of kareah spoke to 
gedaliah in mizpah secretly  saying  
let me go  i pray thee  and i will slay  
ishmael the son of nethaniah  and no 
man shall know it  wherefore should 
he take thy life  that all the jews that 
are gathered unto thee should be 
scattered  and the remnant of judah 
perish  16but gedaliah the son of 
ahikam said unto johanan the son of 
kareah  thou shalt not do this thing  
for thou speakest falsely of ishmael   
now it came to pass in the 
seventh month  that ishmael 
the son of nethaniah  the son of 
elishama  of the seed royal  and one of 41 jeremiah  
734 
 the chief officers of the king  and ten 
men wit h him  came unto gedaliah the 
son of ahikam to mizpah  and there 
they did eat bread together in mizpah  
2then arose ishmael the son of 
nethaniah  and the ten men that were 
with him  and smote gedaliah the son 
of ahikam the son of shaphan with the 
sword  and slew him  whom the king 
of babylon had made governor over 
the land  3ishmael also slew all the 
jews that were with him  even with 
gedaliah  at mizpah  and the 
chaldeans that were found there  even 
the men of war   
4and it came to pass the second day 
after he had slain gedaliah  and no 
man knew it  5that there came certain 
men from shechem  from shiloh  and 
from samaria  even fourscore men  
having their beards shaven and their 
clothes rent  and having cut 
themselves  with meal offerings and 
frankincense in  their hand to bring 
them to the house of the lord 6and 
ishmael the son of nethaniah went 
forth from mizpah to meet them  
weeping all along as he went  and it 
came to pass  as he met them  he said 
unto them  come to gedaliah the son 
of ahikam  7and it w as so  when they 
came into the midst of the city  that 
ishmael the son of nethaniah slew 
them  and cast them into the midst of 
the pit  he and the men that were with 
him 8but ten men were found among 
them that said unto ishmael  slay us 
not for we have  stores hidden in the 
field of wheat  and of barley  and of oil and of honey  so he forbore  and 
slew them not among their brethren  
9now the pit wherein ishmael cast all 
the dead bodies of the men whom he 
had slain by the side of gedaliah was 
that whic h asa the king had made for 
fear of baasa king of israel  the same 
ishmael the son of nethaniah filled 
with them that were slain  10then 
ishmael carried away captive all the 
residue of the people that were in 
mizpah  even the king s daughters  
and all the people that remained in 
mizpah  whom nebuzaradan the 
captain of the guard had committed to 
gedaliah the son of ahikam  ishmael 
the son of nethaniah carried them 
away captive  and departed to go over 
to the children of ammon   
11but when johanan the son of 
kareah  and all the captains of the 
forces that were with him  heard of all 
the evil that ishmael the son of 
nethaniah had done  12then they took 
all the men  and went to fight with 
ishmael the son of nethaniah  and 
found him by the great waters that are 
in gibeon  13now it came to pass  that 
when all the people that were with 
ishmael saw johanan the son of 
kareah  and all the captains of the 
forces that were with him  then they 
were glad  14so all the people that 
ishmael had carried away captive from 
mizpa h cast about and returned  and 
went unto johanan the son of kareah  
15but ishmael the son of nethaniah 
escaped from johanan with eight men  
and went to the children of ammon   jeremiah  
735 
 16then took johanan the son of 
kareah  and all the captains of the 
forces that w ere with him  all the 
remnant of the people whom he had 
recovered from ishmael the son of 
nethaniah  from mizpah  after that he 
had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam  
the men  even the men of war  and the 
women  and the children  and the 
officers  whom he h ad brought back 
from gibeon  17and they departed  and 
dwelt in geruth chimham  which is by 
beth lehem  to go to enter into egypt  
18because of the chaldeans  for they 
were afraid of them  because ishmael 
the son of nethaniah had slain 
gedaliah the son of a hikam  whom 
the king of babylon made governor 
over the land   
then all the captains of the 
forces  and johanan the son of 
kareah  and jezaniah the son of 
hoshaiah  and all the people from the 
least even unto the greatest  came near  
2and said unto jerem iah the prophet  
let we pray thee  our supplication be 
accepted before thee  and pray for us 
unto the lord thy god  even for all 
this remnant  for we are left but a few 
of many  as thine eyes do behold us  
3that the lord thy god may tell us the 
way where in we should walk  and the 
thing that we should do  4then 
jeremiah the prophet said unto them  
i have heard you  behold  i will pray 
unto the lord your god according to 
your words  and it shall come to pass  
that whatsoever thing the lord shall 
answer yo u i will declare it unto you  i will keep nothing back from you  
5then they said to jeremiah  the 
lord be a true and faithful witness 
against us  if we do not even according 
to all the word wherewith the lord thy 
god shall send thee to us  6whether it 
be good  or whether it be evil  we will 
hearken to the voice of the lord our 
god to whom we send thee  that it 
may be well with us  when we hearken 
to the voice of the lord our god   
7and it came to pass after ten days  
that the word of the lord came unto  
jeremiah  8then called he johanan the 
son of kareah  and all the captains of 
the forces that were with him  and all 
the people from the least even to the 
greatest  9and said unto them  thus 
saith the lord the god of israel  unto 
whom ye sent me to prese nt your 
supplication before him  10if ye will 
still abide in this land  then will i build 
you and not pull you down  and i will 
plant you  and not pluck you up  for i 
repent me of the evil that i have done 
unto you  11be not afraid of the king of 
babylon  of whom ye are afraid  be 
not afraid of him  saith the lord for i 
am with you to save you  and to 
deliver you from his hand  12and i will 
grant you compassion  that he may 
have compassion upon you  and cause 
you to return to your own land  13but if 
ye sa y we will not abide in this land  
so that ye hearken not to the voice of 
the lord your god  14saying  no but 
we will go into the land of egypt  
where we shall see no war  nor hear 
the sound of the horn  nor have hunger 42 jeremiah  
736 
 of bread  and there will we abide  
15now therefore hear ye the word of 
the lord o remnant of judah  thus 
saith the lord of hosts  the god of 
israel  if ye wholly set your faces to 
enter into egypt  and go to sojourn 
there  16then it shall come to pass  that 
the sword  which ye fear  shall 
overtake you there in the land of 
egypt  and the famine  whereof ye are 
afraid  shall follow hard after you there 
in egypt  and there ye shall die  17so 
shall it be with all the men that set 
their faces to go into egypt to sojourn 
there  they shall die by the sword  by 
the famine  and by the pestilence  and 
none of them shall remain or escape 
from the evil that i will bring upon 
them  18for thus saith the lord of 
hosts  the god of israel  as mine 
anger and my fury hath been poured 
forth upon the inhabitants  of 
jerusalem  so shall my fury be poured 
forth upon you  when ye shall enter 
into egypt  and ye shall be an 
execration  and an astonishment  and a 
curse  and a reproach  and ye shall see 
this place no more  19the lord hath 
spoken concerning you  o remnant  of 
judah  go ye not into egypt  know 
certainly that i have forewarned you 
this day  20for ye have dealt 
deceitfully against your own souls  for 
ye sent me unto the lord your god  
saying  pray for us unto the lord our 
god and according unto all that the 
lord our god shall say  so declare 
unto us  and we will do it  21and i have 
this day declared it to you  but ye have not hearkened to the voice of the lord 
your god in any thing for which he 
hath sent me unto you  22now 
therefore know certainly that ye shal l 
die by the sword  by the famine  and 
by the pestilence  in the place whither 
ye desire to go to sojourn there   
and it came to pass  that when 
jeremiah had made an end of 
speaking unto all the people all the 
words of the lord their god  
wherewith the  lord their god had sent 
him to them  even all these words  
2then spoke azariah the son of 
hoshaiah  and johanan the son of 
kareah  and all the proud men  saying 
unto jeremiah  thou speakest falsely  
the lord our god hath not sent thee to 
say ye shall no t go into egypt to 
sojourn there  3but baruch the son of 
neriah setteth thee on against us  to 
deliver us into the hand of the 
chaldeans  that they may put us to 
death  and carry us away captives to 
babylon  4so johanan the son of 
kareah  and all the capt ains of the 
forces  and all the people  hearkened 
not to the voice of the lord to dwell 
in the land of judah  5but johanan the 
son of kareah  and all the captains of 
the forces  took all the remnant of 
judah  that were returned from all the 
nations whithe r they had been driven 
to sojourn in the land of judah  6the 
men and the women  and the children  
and the king s daughters  and every 
person that nebuzaradan the captain of 
the guard had left with gedaliah the 
son of ahikam  the son of shaphan  43 jeremiah  
737 
 and jeremi ah the prophet  and baruch 
the son of neriah  7and they came into 
the land of egypt  for they hearkened 
not to the voice of the lord and they 
came even to tahpanhes   
8then came the word of the lord 
unto jeremiah in tahpanhes  saying  
9take great stones in thy hand  and 
hide them in the mortar in the 
framework  which is at the entry of 
pharaoh s house in tahpanhes  in the 
sight of the men of judah  10and say 
unto them  thus saith the lord of 
hosts  the god of israel  behold  i will 
send and take nebuchadr ezzar the king 
of babylon  my servant  and will set 
his throne upon these stones that i 
have hid  and he shall spread his royal 
pavilion over them  11and he shall 
come  and shall smite the land of 
egypt  such as are for death to death  
and such as are for captivity to 
captivity  and such as are for the sword 
to the sword  12and i will kindle a fire 
in the houses of the gods of egypt  and 
he shall burn them  and carry them 
away captives  and he shall fold up the 
land of egypt  as a shepherd foldeth up 
his ga rment  and he shall go forth from 
thence in peace  13he shall also break 
the pillars of beth shemesh  that is in 
the land of egypt  and the houses of 
the gods of egypt shall he burn with 
fire  
 
the word that came to 
jeremiah concerning all the 
jews th at dwelt in the land of egypt  
that dwelt at migdol  and at tahpanhes  and at noph  and in the 
country of pathros  saying  2thus 
saith the lord of hosts  the god of 
israel  ye have seen all the evil that i 
have brought upon jerusalem  and 
upon all the cit ies of judah  and 
behold  this day they are a desolation  
and no man dwelleth therein  3because 
of their wickedness which they have 
committed to provoke me  in that they 
went to offer  and to serve other gods  
whom they knew not  neither they  nor 
ye nor your fathers  4howbeit i sent 
unto you all my servants the prophets  
sending them betimes and often  
saying  oh do not this abominable 
thing that i hate  5but they hearkened 
not nor inclined their ear to turn from 
their wickedness  to forbear offering 
unto other gods  6wherefore my fury 
and mine anger was poured forth  and 
was kindled in the cities of judah and 
in the streets of jerusalem  and they 
are wasted and desolate  as at this day  
7therefore now thus saith the lord 
the god of hosts  the god of i srael  
wherefore commit ye this great evil 
against your own souls  to cut off from 
you man and woman  infant and 
suckling  out of the midst of judah  to 
leave you none remaining  8in that ye 
provoke me with the works of your 
hands  offering unto other gods  in the 
land of egypt  whither ye are gone to 
sojourn  that ye may be cut off  and 
that ye may be a curse and a reproach 
among all the nations of the earth  
9have ye forgotten the wicked deeds 
of your fathers  and the wicked deeds 44 jeremiah  
738 
 of the kings of judah  and the wicked 
deeds of their wives  and your own 
wicked deeds  and the wicked deeds of 
your wives  which they committed in 
the land of judah  and in the streets of 
jerusalem  10they are not humbled 
even unto this day  neither have they 
feared  nor walked in  my law  nor in 
my statutes  that i set before you and 
before your fathers  11therefore thus 
saith the lord of hosts  the god of 
israel  behold  i will set my face 
against you for evil  even to cut off all 
judah  12and i will take the remnant of 
judah  that have set their faces to go 
into the land of egypt to sojourn there  
and they shall all be consumed  in the 
land of egypt shall they fall  they shall 
be consumed by the sword and by the 
famine  they shall die  from the least 
even unto the greatest  by the  sword 
and by the famine  and they shall be an 
execration  and an astonishment  and a 
curse  and a reproach  13for i will 
punish them that dwell in the land of 
egypt  as i have punished jerusalem  
by the sword  by the famine  and by 
the pestilence  14so th at none of the 
remnant of judah  that are gone into 
the land of egypt to sojourn there  
shall escape or remain  that they 
should return into the land of judah  to 
which they have a desire to return to 
dwell there  for none shall return save 
such as shall e scape   
15then all the men who knew that 
their wives offered unto other gods  
and all the women that stood by  a 
great assembly  even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt  in 
pathros  answered jeremiah  saying  
16as for the word that thou hast 
spoken unto us in the name of the 
lord we will not hearken unto thee  
17but we will certainly perform every 
word that is gone forth out of our 
mouth  to offer unto the queen of 
heaven  and to pour out drink 
offerings unto her  as we have done  
we and our fathers  our kings and our 
princes  in the cities of judah  and in 
the streets of jerusalem  for then had 
we plenty of food  and were well  and 
saw no evil  18but since we let off to 
offer to the queen of heaven  and to 
pour out drink offerings unto her  we 
have wanted all things  and have been 
consumed by the sword and by the 
famine  19and is it we that offer to the 
queen of heaven  and pour out drink 
offerings unto her  did we make her 
cakes in her image  and pour out 
drink offerings unto her  without our  
husbands   
20then jeremiah said unto all the 
people  to the men  and to the women  
even to all the people that had given 
him that answer  saying  21the 
offering that ye offered in the cities of 
judah  and in the streets of jerusalem  
ye and your fathers  your kings and 
your princes  and the people of the 
land did not the lord remember them  
and came it not into his mind  22so 
that the lord could no longer bear  
because of the evil of your doings  and 
because of the abominations which ye 
have committed  therefore is your land jeremiah  
739 
 become a desolation  and an 
astonishment  and a curse  without an 
inhabitant  as at this day  23because ye 
have offered  and because ye have 
sinned against the lord and have not 
hearkened to the voice of the lord nor 
walked in his law nor in his statutes  
nor in his testimonies  therefore this 
evil is happened unto you  as at this 
day  
24moreover jeremiah said unto all 
the people  and to all the women  
hear the word of the lord all judah 
that are in the land of egypt  25thus 
saith the lord of hosts  the god of 
israel  saying  ye and your wives have 
both spoken with your mouths  and 
with your hands have fulfilled it  
saying  we will surely perform our 
vows that we have vowed  to offer to 
the queen of heaven  and to pour out 
drink offerings unto her  ye shall 
surely establish your vows  and surely 
perform your vows  26therefore hear 
ye the word of the lord all judah that 
dwell in the land of egypt  behold  i 
have sworn by my great name  saith 
the lord that my name shall no more 
be named in the mouth of any man of 
judah in all the land of egypt saying  
as the lord g od liveth  27behold  i 
watch over them for evil  and not for 
good  and all the men of judah that are 
in the land of egypt shall be consumed 
by the sword and by the famin e until 
there be an end of them  28and they 
that escape the sword shall return out 
of the land of egypt into the land of 
judah  few in number  and all the remnant of judah  that are gone into 
the land of egypt to sojourn there  
shall know whose word shall  stand  
mine  or theirs  29and this shall be the 
sign unto you  saith the lord that i 
will punish you in this place  that ye 
may know that my words shall surely 
stand against you for evil  30thus saith 
the lord behold  i will give pharaoh 
hophra king of egypt into the hand of 
his enemies  and into the hand of them 
that seek his life  as i gave zedekiah 
king of judah into the hand of 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  his 
enemy  and that sought his life   
 
the word that jeremiah the 
prophet spoke unto bar uch the 
son of neriah  when he wrote these 
words in a book at the mouth of 
jeremiah  in the fourth year of 
jehoiakim the son of josiah  king of 
judah  saying  2thus saith the lord 
the god of israel  concerning thee  o 
baruch  thou didst say   
3woe is me now  
for the lord hath added sorrow to 
my pain   
i am weary with my groaning   
and i find no rest   
4thus shalt thou say unto him   
thus saith the lord  
behold  that which i have built will 
i break down   
and that which i have planted i will 
pluck up   
and this in the whole land   
5and seekest thou great things for 
thyself   45 jeremiah  
740 
 seek them not   
for behold  i will bring evil upon all 
flesh  saith the lord but thy life will i 
give unto thee for a prey in all places 
whither thou goest   
 
the word of the lord which 
came to jeremiah the prophet 
concerning the nations   
2of egypt  concerning the army of 
pharaoh neco king of egypt  which 
was by the river euphrates in 
carchemish  which nebuchadrezzar 
king of babylon smote in the fourth 
year of jehoiakim the son of josiah  
king of judah   
3make ready buckler and shield   
and draw near to battle   
4harness the horses  and mount  ye 
horsemen   
and stand forth with your helmets   
furbish the spears  put on the coats 
of mail   
5wherefore do i see them dismayed 
and tur ned backward   
and their mighty ones are beaten 
down   
and they are fled apace  and look 
not back   
terror is on every side  saith the 
lord  
6the swift cannot flee away   
nor the mighty man escape   
in the north by the river euphrates  
have they stumbled and fallen   
7who is this like the nile that riseth 
up  
like the rivers whose waters toss 
themselves   8egypt is like the nile that riseth up   
and like the rivers whose waters 
toss themselves   
and he saith  i will rise up  i will 
cover the earth   
i will destroy the city and the 
inhabitants thereof   
9prance  ye horses  and rush madly  
ye chariots   
and let the mighty men go forth   
cush and put  that handle the shield   
and the ludim  that handle and 
bend the bow   
 
10for the lord g od of hosts shall 
have on that day  
a day of vengeance  that he may 
avenge him of his adversaries   
and the sword shall devour and be 
satiate   
and shall be made drunk with their 
blood   
for the lord g od of hosts hath a 
sacrifice  
in the north country by the river 
euphrates   
11go up into gilead  and take balm   
o virgin daughter of egypt   
in vain dost thou use many 
medicines   
there is no cure for thee   
12the nations have heard of thy 
shame   
and the earth is full of thy cry   
for the mighty man hath stumbled 
against the m ighty   
they are fallen both of them 
together   
 46 jeremiah  
741 
 13the word that the lord spoke to 
jeremiah the prophet  how that 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon 
should come and smite the land of 
egypt   
14declare ye in egypt  and announce 
in migdol   
and announce in noph and in 
tahpanhes   
say ye  stand forth  and prepare 
thee  
for the sword hath devoured round 
about thee   
15why is thy strong one 
overthrown   
he stood not  because the lord did 
thrust him down   
16he made many to stumble   
yea they fell one upon anothe r  
and said  arise  and let us return to 
our own people   
and to the land of our birth   
from the oppressing sword   
17they cried there  pharaoh king of 
egypt is but a noise   
he hath let the appointed time pass 
by  
18as i live  saith the king   
whose name is the lord of hosts   
surely like tabor among the 
mountains   
and like carmel by the sea  so shall 
he come   
19o thou daughter that dwellest in 
egypt   
furnish thyself to go into captivity   
for noph shall become a desolation   
and shall be laid wa ste without 
inhabitant    
20egypt is a very fair heifer   
but the gadfly out of the north is 
come  it is come   
21also her mercenaries in the midst 
of her  
are like calves of the stall   
for they also are turned back  they 
are fled away together   
they di d not stand   
for the day of their calamity is 
come upon them   
the time of their visitation   
22the sound thereof shall go like the 
serpent s  
for they march with an army   
and come against her with axes   
as hewers of wood   
23they cut down her forest  saith the 
lord  
though it cannot be searched   
because they are more than the 
locusts   
and are innumerable   
24the daughter of egypt is put to 
shame   
she is delivered into the hand of the 
people of the north   
25the lord of hosts  the god of israel  
saith behold  i will punish amon of 
no and pharaoh  and egypt  with her 
gods  and her kings  even pharaoh  and 
them that trust in him  26and i will 
deliver them into the hand of those that 
seek their lives  and into the hand of 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylo n and 
into the hand of his servants  and 
afterwards it shall be inhabited  as in 
the days of old  saith the lord  jeremiah  
742 
  
27but fear not thou  o jacob my 
servant   
neither be dismayed  o israel   
for lo i will save thee from afar   
and thy seed from the land of their 
captivity   
and jacob shall again be quiet and 
at ease   
and none shall make him afraid   
28fear not thou  o jacob my 
servant  saith the lord  
for i am with thee   
for i will make a full end of all the 
nations whither i have driven 
thee  
but i w ill not make a full end of 
thee  
and i will correct thee in measure   
but will not utterly destroy thee   
 
the word of the lord that 
came to jeremiah the prophet 
concerning the philistines  before that 
pharaoh smote gaza   
2thus saith the lord  
behold waters rise up out of the 
north   
and shall become an overflowing 
stream   
and they shall overflow the land 
and all that is therein   
the city and them that dwell 
therein   
and the men shall cry   
and all the inhabitants of the land 
shall wail   
3at the  noise of the stamping of the 
hoofs of his strong ones   at the rushing of his chariots  at the 
rumbling of his wheels   
the fathers look not back to their 
children  
for feebleness of hands   
4because of the day that cometh  
to spoil all the philistines   
to cut off from tyre and zidon  
every helper that remaineth   
for the lord will spoil the 
philistines   
the remnant of the isle of caphtor   
5baldness is come upon gaza   
ashkelon is brought to nought  the 
remnant of their valley   
how long wilt thou cut t hyself   
6o thou sword of the lord  
how long will it be ere thou be 
quiet   
put up thyself into thy scabbard   
rest and be still   
7how canst thou be quiet   
for the lord hath given it a charge   
against ashkelon  and against the 
seashore   
there hath h e appointed it   
 
of moab   
 
thus saith the lord of hosts  the 
god of israel   
woe unto nebo  for it is spoiled   
kiriathaim is put to shame  it is 
taken   
misgab is put to shame and 
dismayed   
2the praise of moab is no more   
in heshbon they have devis ed evil 
against her   47 
48 jeremiah  
743 
 come  and let us cut her off from 
being a nation   
thou also  o madmen  shalt be 
brought to silence   
the sword shall pursue thee   
3hark  a cry from horonaim   
spoiling and great destruction   
4moab is destroyed   
her little ones h ave caused a cry to 
be heard   
5for by the ascent of luhith  
with continual weeping shall they 
go up   
for in the going down of horonaim  
they have heard the distressing cry 
of destruction   
6flee save your lives   
and be like a tamarisk in the 
wilderness   
 
7for because thou hast trusted  
in thy works and in thy treasures   
thou also shalt be taken   
and chemosh shall go forth into 
captivity   
his priests and his princes together   
8and the spoiler shall come upon 
every city   
and no city shall escape   
the valley also shall perish  and the 
plain shall be destroyed   
as the lord hath spoken   
9give wings unto moab   
for she must fly and get away   
and her cities shall become a 
desolation   
without any to dwell therein   
10cursed be he that doeth the work 
of the lord with a slack hand   and cursed be he that keepeth back 
his sword from blood   
11moab hath been at ease from his 
youth   
and he hath settled on his lees   
and hath not been emptied from 
vessel to vessel   
neither hath he gone into captivity   
therefore his taste remaineth in 
him  
and his scent is not changed   
12therefore  behold  the days come   
saith the lord  
that i will send unto him them that 
tilt up   
and they shall tilt him up   
and they shall empty his vessels   
and break their bottles in pieces   
13and moab shall be ashamed of 
chemosh   
as the house of israel was ashamed  
of beth el their confidence   
 
14how say ye  we are mighty men   
and valiant men for the war   
15moab is spoiled  and they are gone 
up into her cities   
and his chos en young men are gone 
down to the slaughter   
saith the king   
whose name is the lord of hosts   
16the calamity of moab is near to 
come   
and his affliction hasteth fast   
17bemoan him  all ye that are round 
about him   
and all ye that know his name   
say how is the strong staff 
broken   jeremiah  
744 
 the beautiful rod    
18o thou daughter that dwellest in 
dibon   
come down from thy glory  and sit 
in thirst   
for the spoiler of moab is come up 
against thee   
he hath destroyed thy strongholds   
19o inhabitant of aroer  stand by the 
way and watch   
ask him that fleeth  and her that 
escapeth   
say what hath been done   
20moab is put to shame  for it is 
dismayed   
wail and cry   
tell ye it in arnon   
that moab is spoiled   
21and judgment is come upon the 
country of the  plain  upon holon  and 
upon jahzah  and upon mephaath  
22and upon dibon  and upon nebo  and 
upon beth diblathaim  23and upon 
kiriathaim  and upon beth gamul  and 
upon beth meon  24and upon kerioth  
and upon bozrah  and upon all the 
cities of the land of m oab far or near   
25the horn of moab is cut off   
and his arm is broken   
saith the lord  
26make ye him drunken   
for he magnified himself against the 
lord  
and moab shall wallow in his 
vomit   
and he also shall be in derision   
27for was not israel a d erision unto 
thee  
was he found among thieves   for as often as thou speakest of him   
thou waggest the head   
28o ye that dwell in moab   
leave the cities  and dwell in the 
rock  
and be like the dove that maketh 
her nest  
in the sides of the pit s mouth   
 
29we have heard of the pride of 
moab   
he is very proud   
his loftiness  and his pride  and his 
haughtiness   
and the assumption of his heart   
30i know his arrogancy  saith the 
lord  
that it is ill founded   
his boastings have wrought nothing 
wellfounded   
31therefore will i wail for moab   
yea i will cry out for all moab   
for the men of kir heres shall my 
heart moan   
32with more than the weeping of 
jazer will i weep for thee   
o vine of sibmah   
thy branches passed over the sea   
they reached eve n to the sea of 
jazer   
upon thy summer fruits and upon 
thy vintage  
the spoiler is fallen   
33and gladness and joy is taken 
away  
from the fruitful field  and from the 
land of moab   
and i have caused wine to cease 
from the winepresses   jeremiah  
745 
 none shall tread with shouting   
the shouting shall be no shouting   
34from the cry of heshbon even 
unto elealeh   
even unto jahaz have they uttered 
their voice   
from zoar even unto horonaim   
a heifer of three years old   
for the waters of nimrim also  
shall be desolate   
 
35moreover i will cause to cease in 
moab   
saith the lord  
him that offereth in the high place   
and him that offereth to his gods   
36therefore my heart moaneth for 
moab  
like pipes  and my heart moaneth 
like pipes for the men of kir 
heres   
therefore  the abundance that he 
hath gotten is perished   
37for every head is bald   
and every beard clipped   
upon all the hands are cuttings   
and upon the loins sackcloth   
38on all the housetops of moab and 
in the broad places thereof  
there is lamentation ever y where   
for i have broken moab like a 
vessel wherein is no pleasure   
saith the lord  
39how is it broken down   wail ye   
how hath moab turned the back 
with shame    
so shall moab become a derision 
and a dismay  
to all that are round about him    
40for thus saith the lord  
behold  he shall swoop as a vulture   
and shall spread out his wings 
against moab   
41the cities are taken   
and the strongholds are seized   
and the heart of the mighty men of 
moab at that day  
shall be as the heart of a woman in  
her pangs   
42and moab shall be destroyed from 
being a people   
because he hath magnified himself 
against the lord  
43terror  and the pit  and the trap   
are upon thee  o inhabitant of 
moab   
saith the lord  
44he that fleeth from the terror  
shall fall into the pit   
and he that getteth up out of the pit  
shall be taken in the trap   
for i will bring upon her  even upon 
moab   
the year of their visitation  saith the 
lord  
 
45in the shadow of heshbon the 
fugitives  
stand without strength   
for a fire is gone forth out of 
heshbon   
and a flame from the midst of 
sihon   
and it devoureth the corner of 
moab   
and the crown of the head of the 
tumultuous ones   jeremiah  
746 
 46woe unto thee  o moab   
the people of chemosh is undone   
for thy sons are taken away captive   
and thy daughters into captivity   
47yet will i turn the captivity of 
moab  
in the end of days  saith the lord  
 
thus far is the judgment of moab   
 
of the children of ammon   
 
thus saith the lord  
hath israel no sons   
hath he no heir   
why then doth ma lcam take 
possession of gad   
and his people dwell in the cities 
thereof   
2therefore  behold  the days come  
saith the lord  
that i will cause an alarm of war to 
be heard  
against rabbah of the children of 
ammon   
and it shall become a desolate 
mound   
and her daughters shall be burned 
with fire   
then shall israel dispossess them 
that did dispossess him   
saith the lord  
3wail  o heshbon  for ai is undone   
cry ye daughters of rabbah  gird 
you with sackcloth   
lament  and run to and fro among 
the folds   
for malcam shall go into captivity   
his priests and his princes together   4wherefore gloriest thou in the 
valleys   
thy flowing valley  o backsliding 
daughter   
that didst trust in thy treasures   
who shall come unto me   
5behold  i will bring a ter ror upon 
thee  
saith the lord g od of hosts   
from all that are round about thee   
and ye shall be driven out every 
man right forth   
and there shall be none to gather up 
him that wandereth   
6but afterward i will bring back the 
captivity of the children o f 
ammon   
saith the lord  
 
7of edom   
 
thus saith the lord of hosts   
is wisdom no more in teman   
is counsel perished from the 
prudent   
is their wisdom vanished   
8flee ye  turn back  dwell deep   
o inhabitants of dedan   
for i do bring the calamity of esau 
upon him   
the time that i shall punish him   
9if grape gatherers came to thee   
would they not leave some gleaning 
grapes   
if thieves by night   
would they not destroy till they had 
enough   
10but i have made esau bare   
i have uncovered his secret places   49 jeremiah  
747 
 and he shall not be able to hide 
himself   
his seed is spoiled  and his brethren   
and his neighbours  and he is not   
11leave thy fatherless children  i 
will rear them   
and let thy widows trust in me   
12for thus saith the lord behold  they 
to whom it pertained not to drink of 
the cup shall assuredly drink  and art 
thou he that shall altogether go 
unpunished  thou shalt not go 
unpunished  but thou shalt surely 
drink  13for i have sworn by myself  
saith the lord that bozrah shall 
become an aston ishment  a reproach  a 
waste  and a curse  and all the cities 
thereof shall be perpetual wastes   
14i have heard a message from the 
lord  
and an ambassador is sent among 
the nations   
gather yourselves together  and 
come against her   
and rise up to the battle   
15for behold  i make thee small 
among the nations   
and despised among men   
16thy terribleness hath deceived 
thee  
even the pride of thy heart   
o thou that dwellest in the clefts of 
the rock   
that holdest the height of the hill   
though thou  shouldest make thy 
nest as high as the eagle   
i will bring thee down from thence  
saith the lord  17and edom shall become an 
astonishment   
every one that passeth by it  
shall be astonished and shall hiss at 
all the plagues thereof   
18as in the overthr ow of sodom and 
gomorrah  
and the neighbour cities thereof  
saith the lord  
no man shall abide there   
neither shall any son of man dwell 
therein   
19behold  he shall come up like a 
lion from the thickets of the 
jordan  
against the strong habitation   
for i will suddenly make him run 
away from it   
and whoso is chosen  him will i 
appoint over it   
for who is like me  and who will 
appoint me a time   
and who is that shepherd that will 
stand before me   
20therefore hear ye the counsel of 
the lord  
that he h ath taken against edom   
and his purposes  that he hath 
purposed against the inhabitants 
of teman   
surely the least of the flock shall 
drag them away   
surely their habitation shall be 
appalled at them   
21the earth quaketh at the noise of 
their fall   
there is a cry  the noise whereof is 
heard in the red sea   jeremiah  
748 
 22behold  he shall come up and 
swoop down as the vulture   
and spread out his wings against 
bozrah   
and the heart of the mighty men of 
edom at that day  
shall be as the heart of a woman in 
her pang s  
 
23of damascus   
 
hamath is ashamed  and arpad   
for they have heard evil tidings  
they are melted away   
there is trouble in the sea   
it cannot be quiet   
24damascus is waxed feeble  she 
turneth herself to flee   
and trembling hath seized on her   
anguish and pangs have taken hold 
of her  as of a woman in travail   
25how is the city of praise left 
unrepaired   
the city of my joy   
26therefore her young men shall fall 
in her broad places   
and all the men of war shall be 
brought to silence in that da y  
saith the lord of hosts   
27and i will kindle a fire in the wall 
of damascus   
and it shall devour the palaces of 
benhadad   
 
28of kedar  and of the kingdoms of 
hazor  which nebuchadrezzar king of 
babylon smote   
thus saith the lord  
arise ye  go up against kedar   and spoil the children of the east   
29their tents and their flocks shall 
they take   
they shall carry away for 
themselves their curtains   
and all their vessels  and their 
camels   
and they shall proclaim against 
them a terror on every sid e  
30flee ye  flit far off  dwell deep   
o ye inhabitants of hazor  saith the 
lord  
for nebuchadrezzar king of 
babylon hath taken counsel 
against you   
and hath conceived a purpose 
against you   
31arise  get you up against a nation 
that is at ease   
that dwelleth without care  saith the 
lord  
that have neither gates nor bars   
that dwell alone   
32and their camels shall be a booty   
and the multitude of their cattle a 
spoil   
and i will scatter unto all winds 
them that have the corners polled   
and i wil l bring their calamity from 
every side of them  saith the 
lord  
33and hazor shall be a dwelling 
place of jackals   
a desolation for ever  no man shall 
abide there   
neither shall any son of man dwell 
therein   
 jeremiah  
749 
 34the word of the lord that came to 
jeremiah  the prophet concerning elam 
in the beginning of the reign of 
zedekiah king of judah  saying   
35thus saith the lord of hosts   
behold  i will break the bow of 
elam  
the chief of their might   
36and i will bring against elam the 
four winds  
from the four q uarters of heaven   
and will scatter them toward all 
those winds   
and there shall be no nation whither 
the dispersed of elam shall not 
come   
37and i will cause elam to be 
dismayed before their enemies   
and before them that seek their life   
and i will b ring evil upon them   
even my fierce anger  saith the 
lord  
and i will send the sword after 
them   
till i have consumed them   
38and i will set my throne in elam   
and will destroy from thence king 
and princes  saith the lord  
39but it shall come to pass  in the end 
of days   
that i will bring back the captivity 
of elam  saith the lord  
 
the word that the lord spoke 
concerning babylon  
concerning the land of the chaldeans  
by jeremiah the prophet   
2declare ye among the nations and 
announce   and set u p a standard   
announce  and conceal not   
say babylon is taken   
bel is put to shame  merodach is 
dismayed   
her images are put to shame  her 
idols are dismayed   
3for out of the north there cometh 
up a nation against her   
which shall make her land de solate   
and none shall dwell therein   
they are fled  they are gone  both 
man and beast   
4in those days  and in that time  
saith the lord  
the children of israel shall come   
they and the children of judah 
together   
they shall go on their way weeping   
and shall seek the lord their god   
5they shall inquire concerning zion  
with their faces hitherward   
come ye  and join yourselves to the 
lord  
in an everlasting covenant that shall 
not be forgotten   
 
6my people hath been lost sheep   
their shepherds have caused them 
to go astray   
they have turned them away on the 
mountains   
they have gone from mountain to 
hill  
they have forgotten their resting 
place   
7all that found them have devoured 
them   50 jeremiah  
750 
 and their adversaries said  we are 
not guilty   
because they have sinned against 
the lord the habitation of justice   
even the lord the hope of their 
fathers   
 
8flee out of the midst of babylon   
and go forth out of the land of the 
chaldeans   
and be as the he goats before the 
flocks   
9for lo i will st ir up and cause to 
come up against babylon  
an assembly of great nations from 
the north country   
and they shall set themselves in 
array against her   
from thence she shall be taken   
their arrows shall be as of a mighty 
man that maketh childless   
none sh all return in vain   
10and chaldea shall be a spoil   
all that spoil her shall be satisfied  
saith the lord  
11because ye are glad  because ye 
rejoice   
o ye that plunder my heritage   
because ye gambol as a heifer at 
grass   
and neigh as strong horses   
12your mother shall be sore 
ashamed   
she that bore you shall be 
confounded   
behold  the hindermost of the 
nations  
shall be a wilderness  a dry land  
and a desert   13because of the wrath of the lord it 
shall not be inhabited   
but it shall be wholly des olate   
every one that goeth by babylon  
shall be appalled and hiss at all her 
plagues   
14set yourselves in array against 
babylon round about   
all ye that bend the bow   
shoot at her  spare no arrows   
for she hath sinned against the 
lord  
15shout again st her round about  she 
hath submitted herself   
her buttresses are fallen  her walls 
are thrown down   
for it is the vengeance of the lord 
take vengeance upon her   
as she hath done  do unto her   
16cut off the sower from babylon   
and him that handleth the sickle in 
the time of harvest   
for fear of the oppressing sword 
they shall turn every one to his 
people   
and they shall flee every one to his 
own land   
 
17israel is a scattered sheep   
the lions have driven him away   
first the king of assyria hath 
devoured him   
and last this nebuchadrezzar king 
of babylon hath broken his bones

hosts  the god of israel   
behold  i will punish the king of 
babylon and his land   jeremiah  
751 
 as i have punished the king of 
assyria   
19and i will  bring israel back to his 
pasture   
and he shall feed on carmel and 
bashan   
and his soul shall be satisfied upon 
the hills of ephraim and in 
gilead   
20in those days  and in that time  
saith the lord  
the iniquity of israel shall be sought 
for and there  shall be none   
and the sins of judah  and they shall 
not be found   
for i will pardon them whom i 
leave as a remnant

 30therefore shall her young men fall 
in her broad places   
and all her men of war shall be 
brought to silence in that day   
saith the lord  
 
31behold  i am against thee  o thou 
most arrogant   
saith the lord g od of hos ts  
for thy day is come   
the time that i will punish thee   
32and the most arrogant shall 
stumble and fall   
and none shall raise him up   
and i will kindle a fire in his cities   
and it shall devour all that are 
round about him   
 
33thus saith the lord of hosts   
the children of israel and the 
children of judah are oppressed 
together   
and all that took them captives hold 
them fast   
they refuse to let them go   
34their redeemer is strong   
the lord of hosts is his name   
he will thoroughly plead their 
cause  
that he may give rest to the earth   
and disquiet the inhabitants of 
babylon   
35a sword is upon the chaldeans  
saith the lord  
and upon the inhabitants of 
babylon  and upon her princes  
and upon her wise men   
36a sword is upon the boasters  and 
they shall become fools   a sword is upon her mighty men  
and they shall be dismayed   
37a sword is upon their horses  and 
upon their chariots   
and upon all the mingled people 
that are in the midst of her   
and they shall become as women   
a sword is upon her treasures  and 
they shall be robbed   
38a drought is upon her waters  and 
they shall be dried up   
for it is a land of graven images   
and they are mad upon things of 
horror   
39therefore the wild cats with the 
jackals shall dwell there   
and the ostri ches shall dwell 
therein  and it shall be no more 
inhabited for ever   
neither shall it be dwelt in from 
generation to generation   
40as when god overthrew sodom 
and gomorrah  
and the neighbour cities thereof  
saith the lord  
so shall no man abide there   
neither shall any son of man dwell 
therein   
 
41behold  a people cometh from the 
north   
and a great nation  and many kings  
shall be roused from the uttermost 
parts of the earth   
42they lay hold on bow and spear   
they are cruel  and have no 
compassion   
their voice is like the roaring sea   
and they ride upon horses   jeremiah  
753 
 set in array  as a man for war   
against thee  o daughter of 
babylon   
43the king of babylon hath heard 
the fame of them   
and his hands wax feeble   
anguish hath taken hold of him   
and pain as of a woman in travail   
44behold  he shall come up like a 
lion from the thickets of the 
jordan  
against the strong habitation   
for i will suddenly make them run 
away from it   
and whoso is chosen  him will i 
appoint over it   
for who is like me  and who will 
appoint me a time   
and who is that shepherd that will 
stand before me   
45therefore hear ye the counsel of 
the lord  
that he hath taken against babylon   
and his purposes  that he hath 
purposed against the land of the 
chaldeans   
surely the l east of the flock shall 
drag them away   
surely their habitation shall be 
appalled at them   
46at the noise of the taking of 
babylon the earth quaketh   
and the cry is heard among the 
nations   
 
thus saith the lord  
behold  i will raise up against 
  babylon   and against them that dwell in aleb
kamai  a destroying wind   
2and i will send unto babylon 
strangers  that shall fan her   
and they shall empty her land   
for in the day of trouble they shall 
be against her round about   
3let the archer bend his bow against 
her  
and let him lift himself up against 
her in his coat of mail   
and spare ye not her young men   
destroy ye utterly all her host   
4and they shall fall down slain in 
the land of the chaldeans   
and thrust through in her streets   
5for israe l is not widowed  nor 
judah   
of his god  of the lord of hosts   
for their land is full of guilt  
against the holy one of israel   
6flee out of the midst of babylon   
and save every man his life   
be not cut off in her iniquity   
for it is the time of the lords 
vengeance   
he will render unto her a 
recompense   
7babylon hath been a golden cup in 
lords hand   
that made all the earth drunken   
the nations have drunk of her wine   
therefore the nations are mad   
                                                      
a that is the heart of them that 
rises up against me according to 
ancient t radition a cipher for casdim 
that is chaldea  51 jeremiah  
754 
 8babylon is suddenly fallen and 
destroyed   
wail for her   
take balm for her pain   
if so be she may be healed   
9we would have healed babylon  
but she is not healed   
forsake her  and let us go every one 
into his own country   
for her judgment reacheth unto 
heaven   
and is lifted up even to the skies   
10the lord hath brought forth our 
victory   
come and let us declare in zion  
the work of the lord our god   
 
11make bright the arrows   
fill the quivers   
the lord hath roused the spirit of 
the kings of the medes   
because his device is against 
babylon  to destroy it   
for it is the vengeance of the lord  
the vengeance of his temple   
12set up a standard against the walls 
of babylon   
make the watch strong   
set the watchmen  prepare the 
ambushes   
for the lord hath both devised and 
done  
that which he  spoke concerning the 
inhabitants of babylon   
13o thou that dwellest upon many 
waters   
abundant in treasures   
thine end is come   
the measure of thy covetousness   14the lord of hosts hath sworn by 
himself   
surely i will fill thee with men  as 
with the  canker worm   
and they shall lift up a shout against 
thee  
 
15he that hath made the earth by his 
power   
that hath established the world by 
his wisdom   
and hath stretched out the heavens 
by his discernment   
16at the sound of his giving a 
multitude of w aters in the 
heavens   
he causeth the vapours to ascend 
from the ends of the earth   
he maketh lightnings at the time of 
the rain   
and bringeth forth the wind out of 
his treasuries   
17every man is proved to be brutish  
for the knowledge  
every goldsmith is put to shame by 
the graven image  
that his molten image is falsehood  
and there is no breath in them   
18they are vanity  a work of 
delusion   
in the time of their visitation they 
shall perish   
19the portion of jacob is not like 
these   
for he is the f ormer of all things   
and israel  is the tribe of his 
inheritance   
the lord of hosts is his name   
 jeremiah  
755 
 20thou art my maul and weapons of 
war  
and with thee will i shatter the 
nations   
and with thee will i destroy 
kingdoms   
21and with thee will i shatter the 
horse and his rider   
and with thee will i shatter the 
chariot and him that rideth 
therein   
22and with thee will i shatter man 
and woman   
and with thee will i shatter the old 
man and the youth   
and with thee will i shatter the 
young man and the maid   
23and with thee will i shatter the 
shepherd and his flock   
and with thee will i shatter the 
husbandman and his yoke of 
oxen   
and with thee will i shatter 
governors and deputies   
24and i will render unto babylon 
and to all the inhabitants of 
chaldea  
all their evil that they have done in 
zion  in your sight   
saith the lord  
 
25behold  i am against thee   
o destroying mountain  saith the 
lord  
which destroyest all the earth   
and i will stretch out my hand upon 
thee  
and roll thee down from the rock s  and will make thee a burnt 
mountain   
26and they shall not take of thee a 
stone for a corner   
nor a stone for foundations   
but thou shalt be desolate for ever  
saith the lord  
 
27set ye up a standard in the land   
blow the horn among the nations   
prepare the nations against her   
call together against her the 
kingdoms of ararat  minni  and 
ashkenaz   
appoint a marshal against her   
cause the horses to come up as the 
rough canker worm   
28prepare against her the nations  the 
kings of the medes   
the governors thereof  and all the 
deputies thereof   
and all the land of his dominion   
29and the land quaketh and is in 
pain  
for the purposes of the lord are 
performed against babylon   
to make the land of babylon a 
desolation  without inhabitant   
30the m ighty men of babylon have 
forborne to fight   
they remain in their strongholds   
their might hath failed  they are 
become as women   
her dwelling places are set on fire   
her bars are broken   
31one post runneth to meet another   
and one messenger to meet an 
other   
to tell the king of babylon  jeremiah  
756 
 that his city is taken on every 
quarter   
32and the fords are seized   
and the castles they have burned 
with fire   
and the men of war are affrighted   
 
33for thus saith the lord of hosts  
the god of israel   
the dau ghter of babylon is like a 
threshing floor  
at the time when it is trodden   
yet a little while  and the time of 
harvest  
shall come for her   
34nebuchadrezzar the king of 
babylon hath devoured me   
he hath crushed me   
he hath set me down as an empty 
vessel  
he hath swallowed me up like a 
dragon   
he hath filled his maw with my 
delicacies   
he hath washed me clean   
35the violence done to me and to 
my flesh be upon babylon   
shall the inhabitant of zion say   
and my blood be upon the 
inhabitants of ch aldea   
shall jerusalem say   
 
36therefore thus saith the lord  
behold  i will plead thy cause   
and take vengeance for thee   
and i will dry up her sea   
and make her fountain dry   
37and babylon shall become heaps   
a dwelling place for jackals   an astonishment  and a hissing   
without inhabitant   
38they shall roar together like young 
lions   
they shall growl as lions whelps   
39with their poison i will prepare 
their feast   
and i will make them drunken  that 
they may be convulsed   
and sleep a perpet ual sleep  and not 
wake   
saith the lord  
40i will bring them down like lambs 
to the slaughter   
like rams with he goats   
41how is sheshach taken   
and the praise of the whole earth 
seized   
how is babylon become an 
astonishment  
among the nations   
42the sea is come up upon babylon   
she is covered with the multitude of 
the waves thereof   
43her cities are become a desolation   
a dry land  and a desert   
a land wherein no man dwelleth   
neither doth any son of man pass 
thereby   
44and i will punish bel i n babylon   
and i will bring forth out of his 
mouth that which he hath 
swallowed up   
and the nations shall not flow any 
more unto him   
yea the wall of babylon shall fall   
45my people  go ye out of the midst 
of her   
and save yourselves every man  jeremiah  
757 
 from the fierce anger of the lord  
46and let not your heart faint  
neither fear ye   
for the rumour that shall be heard in 
the land   
for a rumour shall come one year   
and after that in another year a 
rumour   
and violence in the land  ruler 
against ruler   
47therefore behold  the days come   
that i will do judgment upon the 
graven images of babylon   
and her whole land shall be 
ashamed   
and all her slain shall fall in the 
midst of her   
48then the heaven and the earth  and 
all that is therein   
shall sing fo r joy over babylon   
for the spoilers shall come unto her  
from the north  saith the lord  
49as babylon hath caused the slain 
of israel to fall   
so at babylon shall fall the slain of 
all the land   
50ye that have escaped the sword   
go ye stand not stil l  
remember the lord from afar   
and let jerusalem come into your 
mind   
51we are ashamed  because we 
have heard reproach   
confusion hath covered our faces   
for strangers are come  
into the sanctuaries of the l ords 
house   
 52wherefore  behold  the d ays come  
saith the lord  
that i will do judgment upon her 
graven images   
aand through all her land the 
wounded shall groan   
53though babylon should mount up 
to heaven   
and though she should fortify the 
height of her strength   
yet from me shall spoile rs come 
unto her  saith the lord  
54hark  a cry from babylon   
and great destruction from the land 
of the chaldeans   
55for the lord spoileth babylon   
and destroyeth out of her the great 
voice   
and their waves roar like many 
waters   
the noise of their voice is uttered   
56for the spoiler is come upon her  
even upon babylon   
and her mighty men are taken   
their bows are shattered   
for the lord is a god of 
recompenses   
he will surely requite   
57and i will make drunk her princes 
and her wise men   
her governors and her deputies  and 
her mighty men   
and they shall sleep a perpetual 
sleep  and not wake   
saith the king  whose name is the 
lord of hosts   
 
58thus saith the lord of hosts   jeremiah  
758 
 the broad walls of babylon shall be 
utterly overthrown   
and her hig h gates shall be burned 
with fire   
and the peoples shall labour for 
vanity   
and the nations for the fire   
and they shall be weary   
 
59the word which jeremiah the 
prophet commanded seraiah the son of 
neriah  the son of mahseiah  when he 
went with zedeki ah the king of judah 
to babylon in the fourth year of his 
reign  now seraiah was quartermaster  
60and jeremiah wrote in one book all 
the evil that should come upon 
babylon  even all these words that are 
written concerning babylon  61and 
jeremiah said to se raiah  when thou 
comest to babylon  then see that thou 
read all these words  62and say  o 
lord thou hast spoken concerning 
this place  to cut it off  that none shall 
dwell therein  neither man nor beast  
but that it shall be desolate for ever  
63and it s hall be  when thou hast made 
an end of reading this book  that thou 
shalt bind a stone to it  and cast it into 
the midst of the euphrates  64and thou 
shalt say  thus shall babylon sink  and 
shall not rise again because of the evil 
that i will bring upon he r and they 
shall be weary   
 
thus far are the words of jeremiah   
 
zedekiah was one and twenty 
years old when he began to reign  and he reigned eleven years in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of 
libnah  2and he di d that which was 
evil in the sight of the lord according 
to all that jehoiakim had done  3for 
through the anger of the lord did it 
come to pass in jerusalem and judah  
until he had cast them out from his 
presence  and zedekiah rebelled 
against the king of  babylon  4and it 
came to pass in the ninth year of his 
reign  in the tenth month  in the tenth 
day of the month  that nebuchadrezzar 
king of babylon came  he and all his 
army  against jerusalem  and 
encamped against it  and they built 
forts against it rou nd about  5so the 
city was besieged unto the eleventh 
year of king zedekiah  6in the fourth 
month  in the ninth day of the month  
the famine was sore in the city  so that 
there was no bread for the people of 
the land  7then a breach was made in 
the city  and all the men of war fled  
and went forth out of the city by night 
by the way of the gate between the two 
walls  which was by the king s 
garden now the chaldeans were 
against the city round about and they 
went by the way of the arabah  8but 
the army of th e chaldeans pursued 
after the king  and overtook zedekiah 
in the plains of jericho  and all his 
army was scattered from him  9then 
they took the king  and carried him up 
unto the king of babylon to riblah in 
the land of hamath  and he gave 
judgment upon hi m 10and the king of 52 jeremiah  
759 
 babylon slew the sons of zedekiah 
before his eyes  he slew also all the 
princes of judah in riblah  11and he 
put out the eyes of zedekiah  and the 
king of babylon bound him in fetters  
and carried him to babylon  and put 
him in prison till the day of his death   
12now in the fifth month  in the 
tenth day of the month  which was the 
nineteenth year of king 
nebuchadrezzar  king of babylon  
came nebuzaradan the captain of the 
guard  who stood before the king of 
babylon  into jerusalem  13and he 
burned the house of the lord and the 
kings house  and all the houses of 
jerusalem  even every great man s 
house  burned he with fire  14and all 
the army of the chaldeans  that were 
with the captain of the guard  broke 
down all the walls of jerusale m round 
about  15then nebuzaradan the captain 
of the guard carried away captive of 
the poorest sort of the people  and the 
residue of the people that remained in 
the city  and those that fell away  that 
fell to the king of babylon  and the 
residue of the m ultitude  16but 
nebuzaradan the captain of the guard 
left of the poorest of the land to be 
vinedressers and husbandmen  17and 
the pillars of brass that were in the 
house of the lord and the bases and 
the brazen sea that were in the house 
of the lord did the chaldeans break 
in pieces  and carried all the brass of 
them to babylon  18the pots also  and 
the shovels  and the snuffers  and the 
basins  and the pans  and all the vessels of brass wherewith they 
ministered  took they away  19and the 
cups and the f irepans and the basins  
and the pots  and the candlesticks  and 
the pans  and the bowls that which 
was of gold  in gold  and that which 
was of silver  in silver the captain of 
the guard took away  20the two pillars  
the one sea  and the twelve brazen 
bulls that were under the bases  which 
king solomon had made for the house 
of the l ordthe brass of all these 
vessels was without weight  21and as 
for the pillars  the height of the one 
pillar was eighteen cubits  and a line of 
twelve cubits did compass it  and the 
thickness thereof was four fingers  it 
was hollow  22and a capital of brass 
was upon it  and the height of the one 
capital was five cubits  with network 
and pomegranates upon the capital 
round about  all of brass  and the 
second pillar also had like  unto these  
and pomegranates  23and there were 
ninety and six pomegranates on the 
outside  all the pomegranates were a 
hundred upon the network round 
about   
24and the captain of the guard took 
seraiah the chief priest  and zephaniah 
the second priest  and the three keepers 
of the door  25and out of the city he 
took an officer that was set over the 
men of war  and seven men of them 
that saw the king s face  who were 
found in the city  and the scribe of the 
captain of the host  who mustered the 
people of th e land  and threescore men 
of the people of the land  that were jeremiah  
760 
 found in the midst of the city  26and 
nebuzaradan the captain of the guard 
took them  and brought them to the 
king of babylon to riblah  27and the 
king of babylon smote them  and put 
them to d eath at riblah in the land of 
hamath  so judah was carried away 
captive out of his land  28this is the 
people whom nebuchadrezzar carried 
away captive  in the seventh year three 
thousand jews and three and twenty  
29in the eighteenth year of 
nebuchadrezzar  from jerusalem  eight 
hundred thirty and two persons  30in 
the three and twentieth year of 
nebuchadrezzar nebuzaradan the 
captain of the guard carried away 
captive of the jews seven hundred 
forty and five persons  all the persons 
were four thousand and s ix hundred  31and it came to pass in the seven and 
thirtieth year of the captivity of 
jehoiachin king of judah  in the 
twelfth month  in the five and 
twentieth day of the month  that evil 
merodach king of babylon  in the first 
year of his reign  lifted up the head of 
jehoiachin king of judah  and brought 
him forth out of prison  32and he 
spoke kindly to him  and set his throne 
above the throne of the kings that were 
with him in babylon  33and he 
changed his prison garments  and did 
eat bread before him cont inually all 
the days of his life  34and for his 
allowance  there was a continual 
allowance given him of the king of 
babylon  every day a portion until the 
day of his death  all the days of his 
life   
761 
   
ezekiel  
 
now it came to pass in the 
thirtieth year  in the fourth month  
in the fifth day of the month  as i was 
among the captives by the river 
chebar that the heavens were opened  
and i saw visions of god  2in the fifth 
day of the month  which was the fifth 
year of king jehoiachin s captivity  
3the word of the lord came expressly 
unto ezekiel the priest  the son of 
buzi  in the land of the chaldeans by 
the river chebar  and the hand of the 
lord was there upon him   
4and i looked  and behold  a 
stormy wind came out of the north  a 
great cloud  with a fire flashing up  so 
that a brightness was round about it  
and out of the midst thereof as the 
colour of electrum  out of the midst of 
the fire  5and out of the midst thereof 
came the likeness of fou r living 
creatures  and this was their 
appearance  they had the likeness of a 
man 6and every one had four faces  
and every one of them had four wings  
7and their feet were straight feet  and 
the sole of their feet was like the sole 
of a calf s foot  and t hey sparkled like 
the colour of burnished brass  8and 
they had the hands of a man under 
their wings on their four sides  and as 
for the faces and wings of them four  
9their wings were joined one to 
another  they turned not when they went  they went every o ne straight 
forward  10as for the likeness of their 
faces  they had the face of a man  and 
they four had the face of a lion on the 
right side  and they four had the face 
of an ox on the left side  they four had 
also the face of an eagle  11thus were 
their faces  and their wings were 
stretched upward  two wings of every 
one were joined one to another  and 
two covered their bodies  12and they 
went every one straight forward  
whither the spirit was to go  they went  
they turned not when they went  13as 
for the  likeness of the living creatures  
their appearance was like coals of fire  
burning like the appearance of torches  
it flashed up and down among the 
living creatures  and there was 
brightness to the fire  and out of the 
fire went forth lightning  14and the  
living creatures ran and returned as the 
appearance of a flash of lightning   
15now as i beheld the living 
creatures  behold one wheel at the 
bottom hard by the living creatures  at 
the four faces thereof  16the 
appearance of the wheels and their 
work was  like unto the colour of a 
beryl  and they four had one likeness  
and their appearance and their work 
was as it were a wheel within a wheel  
17when they went  they went toward 
their four sides  they turned not when 1 ezekiel  
762 
 they went  18as for their rings  they 
were high and they were dreadful  and 
they four had their rings full of eyes 
round about  19and when the living 
creatures went  the wheels went hard 
by them  and when the living creatures 
were lifted up from the bottom  the 
wheels were lifted up  20whithersoe ver 
the spirit was to go  as the spirit was to 
go thither  so they went  and the 
wheels were lifted up beside them  for 
the spirit of the living creature was in 
the wheels  21when those went  these 
went  and when those stood  these 
stood  and when those we re lifted up 
from the earth  the wheels were lifted 
up beside them  for the spirit of the 
living creature was in the wheels   
22and over the heads of the living 
creatures there was the likeness of a 
firmament  like the colour of the 
terrible ice  stretched  forth over their 
heads above  23and under the 
firmament were their wings 
conformable the one to the other  this 
one of them had two which covered  
and that one of them had two which 
covered  their bodies  24and when they 
went  i heard the noise of their w ings 
like the noise of great waters  like the 
voice of the almighty  a noise of 
tumult like the noise of a host  when 
they stood  they let down their wings  
25for when there was a voice above 
the firmament that was over their 
heads  as they stood  they le t down 
their wings   
26and above the firmament that was 
over their heads was the likeness of a throne  as the appearance of a sapphire 
stone  and upon the likeness of the 
throne was a likeness as the 
appearance of a man upon it above  
27and i saw as the co lour of electrum  
as the appearance of fire round about 
enclosing it  from the appearance of 
his loins and upward  and from the 
appearance of his loins and downward 
i saw as it were the appearance of fire  
and there was brightness round about 
him 28as the  appearance of the bow 
that is in the cloud in the day of rain  
so was the appearance of the 
brightness round about  this was the 
appearance of the likeness of the glory 
of the lord and when i saw it  i fell 
upon my face  and i heard a voice of 
one that s poke   
and he said unto me  son of 
man stand upon thy feet  and i 
will speak with thee  2and spirit 
entered into me when he spoke unto 
me and set me upon my feet  and i 
heard him that spoke unto me   
3and he said unto me  son of man  
i send thee to the children of israel  to 
rebellious nations  that have rebelled 
against me  they and their fathers have 
transgressed against me  even unto 
this very day  4and the children are 
brazen faced and stiff hearted  i do 
send thee unto them  and thou shalt 
say u nto them  thus saith the lord 
god 5and they  whether they will 
hear or whether they will forbear for 
they are a rebellious house yet shall 
know that there hath been a prophet 
among them   2 ezekiel  
763 
 6and thou  son of man  be not afraid 
of them  neither be afraid of  their 
words  though defiers and despisers be 
with thee  and thou dost dwell among 
scorpions  be not afraid of their words  
nor be dismayed at their looks  for 
they are a rebellious house  7and thou 
shalt speak my words unto them  
whether they will hear  or whether 
they will forbear  for they are most 
rebellious   
8and thou  son of man  hear what i 
say unto thee  be not thou rebellious 
like that rebellious house  open thy 
mouth  and eat that which i give thee  
9and when i looked  behold  a hand 
was put for th unto me  and lo a roll of 
a book was therein  10and he spread it 
before me  and it was written within 
and without  and there was written 
therein lamentations  and moaning  
and woe   
and he said unto me  son of 
man eat that which thou findest  
eat this roll  and go  speak unto the 
house of israel  2so i opened my 
mouth  and he caused me to eat that 
roll 3and he said unto me  son of 
man cause thy belly to eat  and fill thy 
bowels with this roll that i give thee  
then did i eat it  and it was in my 
mouth as honey for sweetness   
4and he said unto me  son of man  
go get thee unto the house of israel  
and speak with my words unto them  
5for thou art not sent to a people of an 
unintelligible speech and of a slow 
tongue  but to the house of israel  6not 
to many peoples of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue  whose 
words thou canst not understand  
surely  if i sent thee to them  they 
would hearken unto thee  7but the 
house of israel will not consent to 
hearken unto thee  for they consent not  
to hearken unto me  for all the house 
of israel are of a hard forehead and of 
a stiff heart  8behold  i have made thy 
face hard against their faces  and thy 
forehead hard against their foreheads  
9as an adamant harder than flint have i 
made thy forehead  fear them not  
neither be dismayed at their looks  for 
they are a rebellious house   
10moreover he said unto me  son 
of man  all my words that i shall speak 
unto thee receive in thy heart  and hear 
with thine ears  11and go  get thee to 
them of the capti vity unto the children 
of thy people  and speak unto them  
and tell them  thus saith the lord 
god whether they will hear  or 
whether they will forbear   
12then a spirit lifted me up  and i 
heard behind me the voice of a great 
rushing  blessed be the gl ory of the 
lord from his place  13also the noise 
of the wings of the living creatures as 
they touched one another  and the 
noise of the wheels beside them  even 
the noise of a great rushing  14so a 
spirit lifted me up  and took me away  
and i went in bitt erness  in the heat of 
my spirit  and the hand of the lord 
was strong upon me  15then i came to 
them of the captivity at tel abib that 
dwelt by the river chebar  and i sat 3 ezekiel  
764 
 where they sat  and i remained there 
appalled among them seven days   
16and it came  to pass at the end of 
seven days  that the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  17son of man  i 
have appointed thee a watchman unto 
the house of israel  and when thou 
shalt hear a word at my mouth  thou 
shalt give them warning from me  
18when i say unt o the wicked  thou 
shalt surely die  and thou givest him 
not warning  nor speakest to warn the 
wicked from his wicked way  to save 
his life  the same wicked man shall die 
in his iniquity  but his blood will i 
require at thy hand  19yet if thou warn 
the wic ked and he turn not from his 
wickedness  nor from his wicked way  
he shall die in his iniquity  but thou 
hast delivered thy soul  20again  when 
a righteous man doth turn from his 
righteousness  and commit iniquity  i 
will lay a stumblingblock before him  
he shall die  because thou hast not 
given him warning  he shall die in his 
sin and his righteous deeds which he 
hath done shall not be remembered  
but his blood will i require at thy hand  
21nevertheless if thou warn the 
righteous man  that the righteous sin 
not and he doth not sin  he shall surely 
live because he took warning  and 
thou hast delivered thy soul   
22and the hand of the lord came 
there upon me  and he said unto me  
arise  go forth into the plain  and i 
will there speak with thee  23then i 
arose  and went forth into the plain  
and behold  the glory of the lord stood there  as the glory which i saw 
by the river chebar  and i fell on my 
face 24then spirit entered into me  and 
set me upon my feet  and he spoke 
with me  and said unto me  go shut 
thyself within thy house  25but thou  
son of man  behold  bands shall be put 
upon thee  and thou shalt be bound 
with them  and thou shalt not go out 
among them  26and i will make thy 
tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth  
that thou shalt be dumb  and shalt not 
be to them a reprover  for they are a 
rebellious house  27but when i speak 
with thee  i will open thy mouth  and 
thou shalt say unto them  thus saith 
the lord g od he that heareth  let him 
hear and he that forbeareth  let him 
forbear  for the y are a rebellious 
house   
thou also  son of man  take thee a 
tile and lay it before thee  and 
trace upon it a city  even jerusalem  
2and lay siege against it  and build 
forts against it  and cast up a mound 
against it  set camps also against it  
and se t battering rams against it round 
about  3and take thou unto thee an iron 
griddle  and set it for a wall of iron 
between thee and the city  and set thy 
face toward it  and it shall be besieged  
and thou shalt lay siege against it  this 
shall be a sign to t he house of israel   
4moreover lie thou upon thy left 
side and lay the iniquity of the house 
of israel upon it  according to the 
number of the days that thou shalt lie 
upon it  thou shalt bear their iniquity  
5for i have appointed the years of their 4 ezekiel  
765 
 iniqu ity to be unto thee a number of 
days even three hundred and ninety 
days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of 
the house of israel  6and again  when 
thou hast accomplished these  thou 
shalt lie on thy right side  and shalt 
bear the iniquity of the house of j udah  
forty days  each day for a year  have i 
appointed it unto thee  7and thou shalt 
set thy face toward the siege of 
jerusalem  with thine arm uncovered  
and thou shalt prophesy against it  
8and behold  i lay bands upon thee  
and thou shalt not turn the e from one 
side to another  till thou hast 
accomplished the days of thy siege  
9take thou also unto thee wheat  and 
barley  and beans  and lentils  and 
millet  and spelt  and put them in one 
vessel  and make thee bread thereof  
according to the number of t he days 
that thou shalt lie upon thy side  even 
three hundred and ninety days  shalt 
thou eat thereof  10and thy food which 
thou shalt eat shall be by weight  
twenty shekels a day  from time to 
time shalt thou eat it  11thou shalt 
drink also water by measu re the sixth 
part of a hin  from time to time shalt 
thou drink  12and thou shalt eat it as 
barley cakes  and thou shalt bake it in 
their sight with dung that cometh out 
of man   
13and the lord said even thus 
shall the children of israel eat their 
bread  unclean  among the nations 
whither i will drive them  14then said 
i ah lord g od behold  my soul hath 
not been polluted  for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of 
that which dieth of itself  or is torn of 
beasts  neither came there abhorre d 
flesh into my mouth  15then he said 
unto me  see i have given thee cow s 
dung for man s dung  and thou shalt 
prepare thy bread thereon  16moreover 
he said unto me  son of man  behold  
i will break the staff of bread in 
jerusalem  and they shall eat bread by 
weight  and with anxiety  and they 
shall drink water by measure  and in 
appalment  17that they may want bread 
and water  and be appalled one with 
another  and pine away in their 
iniquity   
 
and thou  son of man  take thee a 
sharp sword  as a bar bers razor 
shalt thou take it unto thee  and cause 
it to pass upon thy head and upon thy 
beard  then take thee balances to 
weigh  and divide the hair  2a third 
part shalt thou burn in the fire in the 
midst of the city  when the days of the 
siege are fulfi lled and thou shalt take 
a third part  and smite it with the 
sword round about her  and a third part 
thou shalt scatter to the wind  and i 
will draw out a sword after them  
3thou shalt also take thereof a few by 
number  and bind them in thy skirts  
4and o f them again shalt thou take  
and cast them into the midst of the fire  
and burn them in the fire  therefrom 
shall a fire come forth into all the 
house of israel   
5thus saith the lord g od this is 
jerusalem  i have set her in the midst 5 ezekiel  
766 
 of the nations  and countries are round 
about her  6and she hath rebelled 
against mine ordinances in doing 
wickedness more than the nations  and 
against my statutes more than the 
countries that are round about her  for 
they have rejected mine ordinances  
and as for my statut es they have not 
walked in them  7therefore thus saith 
the lord g od because ye have 
outdone the nations that are round 
about you  in that ye have not walked 
in my statutes  neither have kept mine 
ordinances  neither have done after the 
ordinances of the nations that are 
round about you  8therefore thus saith 
the lord g od behold  i even i  am 
against thee  and i will execute 
judgments in the midst of thee in the 
sight of the nations  9and i will do in 
thee that which i have not done  and 
whereunto i will  not do any more the 
like because of all thine abominations  
10therefore the fathers shall eat the 
sons in the midst of thee  and the sons 
shall eat their fathers  and i will 
execute judgments in thee  and the 
whole remnant of thee will i scatter 
unto all  the winds  11wherefore  as i 
live saith the lord g od surely  
because thou hast defiled my 
sanctuary with all thy detestable 
things  and with all thine 
abominations  therefore will i also 
diminish thee  neither shall mine eye 
spare  and i also will have no pity  12a 
third part of thee shall die with the 
pestilence  and with famine shall they 
be consumed in the midst of thee  and a third part shall fall by the sword 
round about thee  and a third part i 
will scatter unto all the winds  and will 
draw out a s word after them  13thus 
shall mine anger spend itself  and i 
will satisfy my fury upon them  and i 
will be eased  and they shall know that 
i the lord have spoken in my zeal  
when i have spent my fury upon them  
14moreover i will make thee an 
amazement and a reproach  among the 
nations that are round about thee  in 
the sight of all that pass by  15so it 
shall be a reproach and a taunt  an 
instruction and an astonishment  unto 
the nations that are round about thee  
when i shall execute judgments in thee 
in an ger and in fury  and in furious 
rebukes  i the lord have spoken it  
16when i shall send upon them the evil 
arrows of famine  that are for 
destruction  which i will send to 
destroy you  and i will increase the 
famine upon you  and will break your 
staff of b read 17and i will send upon 
you famine and evil beasts  and they 
shall bereave thee  and pestilence and 
blood shall pass through thee  and i 
will bring the sword upon thee  i the 
lord have spoken it   
and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  2son of man  
set thy face toward the mountains of 
israel  and prophesy against them  3and 
say ye mountains of israel  hear the 
word of the lord g od thus saith the 
lord g od concerning the mountains 
and concerning the hills  concerning 
the ravines and concern ing the valleys  6 ezekiel  
767 
 behold  i even i  will bring a sword 
upon you  and i will destroy your high 
places  4and your altars shall become 
desolate  and your sun images shall be 
broken  and i will cast down your slain 
men before your idols  5and i will lay 
the ca rcasses of the children of israel 
before their idols  and i will scatter 
your bones round about your altars  6in 
all your dwelling places the cities shall 
be laid waste  and the high places shall 
be desolate  that your altars may be 
laid waste and made des olate  and your 
idols may be broken and cease  and 
your sun images may be hewn down  
and your works may be blotted out  
7and the slain shall fall in the midst of 
you and ye shall know that i am the 
lord 8yet will i leave a remnant  in 
that ye shall have some that escape the 
sword among the nations  when ye 
shall be scattered through the 
countries  9and they that escape of you 
shall remember me among the nations 
whither they shall be carried captives  
how that i have been anguished with 
their straying hear t which hath 
departed from me  and with their eyes  
which are gone astray after their idols  
and they shall loathe themselves in 
their own sight for the evils which they 
have committed in all their 
abominations  10and they shall know 
that i am the lord i have not said in 
vain that i would do this evil unto 
them   
11thus saith the lord g od smite 
with thy hand  and stamp with thy 
foot and say  alas because of all the evil abominations of the house of 
israel  for they shall fall by the sword  
by the famin e and by the pestilence  
12he that is far off shall die of the 
pestilence  and he that is near shall fall 
by the sword  and he that remaineth 
and is besieged shall die by the 
famine  thus will i spend my fury 
upon them  13and ye shall know that i 
am the lord when their slain men 
shall be among their idols round about 
their altars  upon every high hill  in all 
the tops of the mountains  and under 
every leafy tree  and under every thick 
terebinth  the place where they did 
offer sweet savour to all their ido ls 
14and i will stretch out my hand upon 
them  and make the land desolate and 
waste  more than the wilderness of 
diblah  throughout all their 
habitations  and they shall know that i 
am the lord  
moreover the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2and 
thou son of man  thus saith the lord 
god concerning the land of israel  an 
end the end is come upon the four 
corners of the land  3now is the end 
upon thee  and i will send mine anger 
upon thee  and will judge thee 
according to thy ways  and i will bri ng 
upon thee all thine abominations  4and 
mine eye shall not spare thee  neither 
will i have pity  but i will bring thy 
ways upon thee  and thine 
abominations shall be in the midst of 
thee and ye shall know that i am the 
lord  7 ezekiel  
768 
 5thus saith the lord g od an evil  a 
singular evil  behold  it cometh  6an 
end is come  the end is come  it 
awaketh against thee  behold  it 
cometh  7the turn is come unto thee  o 
inhabitant of the land  the time is 
come  the day of tumult is near  and 
not of joyful shouting upon th e 
mountains  8now will i shortly pour 
out my fury upon thee  and spend 
mine anger upon thee  and will judge 
thee according to thy ways  and i will 
bring upon thee all thine abominations  
9and mine eye shall not spare  neither 
will i have pity  i will bring  upon thee 
according to thy ways  and thine 
abominations shall be in the midst of 
thee and ye shall know that i the lord 
do smite  10behold the day  behold  it 
cometh  the turn is come forth  the rod 
hath blossomed  arrogancy hath 
budded  11violence is ri sen up into a 
rod of wickedness  nought cometh 
from them  nor from their tumult  nor 
from their turmoil  neither is there 
eminency among them  12the time is 
come  the day draweth near  let not the 
buyer rejoice  nor the seller mourn  for 
wrath is upon all the multitude thereof  
13for the seller shall not return to that 
which is sold  although they be yet 
alive  for the vision is touching the 
whole multitude thereof  which shall 
not return  neither shall any stand 
possessed of the iniquity of his life  
14they have blown the horn  and have 
made all ready  but none goeth to the 
battle  for my wrath is upon all the 
multitude thereof  15the sword is without  and the pestilence and the 
famine within  he that is in the field 
shall die with the sword  and he that is  
in the city  famine and pestilence shall 
devour him  16but they that shall at all 
escape of them  shall be on the 
mountains like doves of the valleys  all 
of them moaning  every one in his 
iniquity  17all hands shall be slack  and 
all knees shall drip wit h water  18they 
shall also gird themselves with 
sackcloth  and horror shall cover them  
and shame shall be upon all faces  and 
baldness upon all their heads  19they 
shall cast their silver in the streets  and 
their gold shall be as an unclean thing  
their silver and their gold shall not be 
able to deliver them in the day of the 
wrath of the lord they shall not 
satisfy their souls  neither fill their 
bowels  because it hath been the 
stumblingblock of their iniquity  20and 
as for the beauty of their ornament  
which was set for a pride  they made 
the images of their abominations and 
their detestable things thereof  
therefore have i made it unto them as 
an unclean thing  21and i will give it 
into the hands of the strangers for a 
prey and to the wicked of the e arth for 
a spoil  and they shall profane it  22i 
will also turn my face from them  and 
they shall profane my secret place  
and robbers shall enter into it  and 
profane it   
23make the chain  for the land is full 
of bloody crimes  and the city is full of 
violence  24wherefore i will bring the 
worst of the nations  and they shall ezekiel  
769 
 possess their houses  i will also make 
the pride of the strong to cease  and 
their holy places shall be profaned  
25horror cometh  and they shall seek 
peace  and there shall be none  
26calamity shall come upon calamity  
and rumour shall be upon rumour  and 
they shall seek a vision of the prophet  
and instruction shall perish from the 
priest  and counsel from the elders  
27the king shall mourn  and the prince 
shall be clothed with appa lment  and 
the hands of the people of the land 
shall be enfeebled  i will do unto them 
after their way  and according to their 
deserts will i judge them  and they 
shall know that i am the lord  
and it came to pass in the sixth 
year in the sixth month  in the 
fifth day of the month  as i sat in my 
house  and the elders of judah sat 
before me  that the hand of the lord 
god fell there upon me  2then i 
beheld  and lo a likeness as the 
appearance of fire  from the 
appearance of his loins and downward  
fire and from his loins and upward  as 
the appearance of brightness  as the 
colour of electrum  3and the form of a 
hand was put forth  and i was taken by 
a lock of my head  and a spirit lifted 
me up between the earth and the 
heaven  and brought me in the visio ns 
of god to jerusalem  to the door of the 
gate of the inner court that looketh 
toward the north  where was the seat 
of the image of jealousy  which 
provoketh to jealousy  4and behold  
the glory of the god of israel was there  according to the vision that  i 
saw in the plain  5then said he unto 
me son of man  lift up thine eyes 
now the way toward the north  so i 
lifted up mine eyes the way toward the 
north  and behold northward of the 
gate of the altar this image of jealousy 
in the entry   
6and he said u nto me  son of man  
seest thou what they do  even the great 
abominations that the house of israel 
do commit here  that i should go far 
off from my sanctuary  but thou shalt 
again see yet greater abominations  
7and he brought me to the door of the 
court  and when i looked  behold a 
hole in the wall  8then said he unto 
me son of man  dig now in the wall  
and when i had digged in the wall  
behold a door  9and he said unto me  
go in  and see the wicked 
abominations that they do here  10so i 
went in and s aw and behold every 
detestable form of creeping things and 
beasts  and all the idols of the house of 
israel  portrayed upon the wall round 
about  11and there stood before them 
seventy men of the elders of the house 
of israel  and in the midst of them 
stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan  
every man with his censer in his hand  
and a thick cloud of incense went up  
12then said he unto me  son of man  
hast thou seen what the elders of the 
house of israel do in the dark  every 
man in his chambers of imagery  for 
they say  the lord seeth us not  the 
lord hath forsaken the land  13he said 
also unto me  thou shalt again see yet 8 ezekiel  
770 
 greater abominations which they do  
14then he brought me to the door of 
the gate of the l ords house which 
was toward the north  and behold 
there sat the women weeping for 
tammuz  15then said he unto me  
hast thou seen this  o son of man  
thou shalt again see yet greater 
abominations than these  16and he 
brought me into the inner court of the 
lords house  and behold  at the door 
of the temple of the lord between the 
porch and the altar  were about five 
and twenty men  with their backs 
toward the temple of the lord and 
their faces toward the east  and they 
worshipped the sun toward the east  
17then he said unto me  hast thou 
seen th is o son of man  is it a light 
thing to the house of judah that they 
commit the abominations which they 
commit here in that they fill the land 
with violence  and provoke me still 
more  and lo they put the branch to 
their nose  18therefore will i also de al 
in fury  mine eye shall not spare  
neither will i have pity  and though 
they cry in mine ears with a loud 
voice  yet will i not hear them   
then he called in mine ears with a 
loud voice  saying  cause ye 
them that have charge over the city to 
draw n ear every man with his 
destroying weapon in his hand  2and 
behold  six men came from the way of 
the upper gate  which lieth toward the 
north  every man with his weapon of 
destruction in his hand  and one man 
in the midst of them clothed in linen  with a  writer s inkhorn on his side  
and they went in  and stood beside the 
brazen altar  3and the glory of the god 
of israel was gone up from the cherub  
whereupon it was  to the threshold of 
the house  and he called to the man 
clothed in linen  who had the wri ters 
inkhorn on his side  4and the lord 
said unto him  go through the midst 
of the city  through the midst of 
jerusalem  and set a mark upon the 
foreheads of the men that sigh and that 
cry for all the abominations that are 
done in the midst thereof  5and to the 
others he said in my hearing  go ye 
through the city after him  and smite  
let not your eye spare  neither have ye 
pity 6slay utterly the old man  the 
young man and the maiden  and little 
children and women  but come not 
near any man upon whom i s the mark  
and begin at my sanctuary  then they 
began at the elders that were before the 
house  7and he said unto them  
defile the house  and fill the courts 
with the slain  go ye forth  and they 
went forth  and smote in the city  8and 
it came to pass  while they were 
smiting  and i was left  that i fell upon 
my face  and cried  and said  ah lord 
god wilt thou destroy all the residue 
of israel in thy pouring out of thy 
fury upon jerusalem  9then said he 
unto me  the iniquity of the house of 
israel a nd judah is exceeding great  
and the land is full of blood  and the 
city full of wresting of judgment  for 
they say  the lord hath forsaken the 
land and the lord seeth not  10and as 9 ezekiel  
771 
 for me also  mine eye shall not spare  
neither will i have pity  but i wi ll bring 
their way upon their head  11and 
behold  the man clothed in linen  who 
had the inkhorn on his side  reported  
saying  i have done according to all 
that thou hast commanded me   
then i looked  and behold  
upon the firmament that was 
over th e head of the cherubim  there 
appeared above them as it were a 
sapphire stone  as the appearance of 
the likeness of a throne  2and he 
spoke unto the man clothed in linen  
and said  go in between the 
wheelwork  even under the cherub  
and fill both thy hand s with coals of 
fire from between the cherubim  and 
dash them against the city  and he 
went in in my sight  3now the 
cherubim stood on the right side of the 
house  when the man went in  and the 
cloud filled the inner court  4and the 
glory of the lord moun ted up from the 
cherub to the threshold of the house  
and the house was filled with the 
cloud  and the court was full of the 
brightness of the l ords glory  5and 
the sound of the wings of the cherubim 
was heard even to the outer court  as 
the voice of god almighty when he 
speaketh  6and it came to pass  when 
he commanded the man clothed in 
linen  saying  take fire from between 
the wheelwork  from between the 
cherubim  that he went in  and stood 
beside a wheel  7and the cherub 
stretched forth his hand from  between 
the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim  and took 
thereof  and put it into the hands of 
him that was clothed in linen  who 
took it and went out  8and there 
appeared in the cherubim the form of a 
mans hand under their wings  9and i 
looked  and behold four wheels beside 
the cherubim  one wheel beside one 
cherub  and another wheel beside 
another cherub  and the appearance of 
the wheels was as the colour of a beryl 
stone  10and as for their appearance  
they four had one likeness  as if a 
wheel had been within a wheel  
11when they went  they went toward 
their four sides  they turned not as they 
went  but to the place whither the head 
looked they followed it  they turned 
not as they went  12and their whole 
body  and their backs  and thei r hands  
and their wings  and the wheels were 
full of eyes round about  even the 
wheels that they four had  13as for the 
wheels  they were called in my hearing 
the wheelwork  14and every one had 
four faces  the first face was the face 
of the cherub  and th e second face was 
the face of a man  and the third the 
face of a lion  and the fourth the face 
of an eagle  15and the cherubim 
mounted up this is the living creature 
that i saw by the river chebar  16and 
when the cherubim went  the wheels 
went beside them  and when the 
cherubim lifted up their wings to 
mount up from the earth  the same 
wheels also turned not from beside 
them  17when they stood  these stood  
and when they mounted up  these 10 ezekiel  
772 
 mounted up with them  for the spirit of 
the living creature was in th em 18and 
the glory of the lord went forth from 
off the threshold of the house  and 
stood over the cherubim  19and the 
cherubim lifted up their wings  and 
mounted up from the earth in my sight 
when they went forth  and the wheels 
beside them  and they stoo d at the door 
of the east gate of the l ords house  
and the glory of the god of israel was 
over them above  20this is the living 
creature that i saw under the god of 
israel by the river chebar  and i knew 
that they were cherubim  21every one 
had four faces  apiece  and every one 
four wings  and the likeness of the 
hands of a man was under their wings  
22and as for the likeness of their faces  
they were the faces which i saw by the 
river chebar  their appearances and 
themselves  they went every one 
straight f orward   
then a spirit lifted me up  and 
brought me unto the east gate 
of the l ords house  which looketh 
eastward  and behold at the door of the 
gate five and twenty men  and i saw in 
the midst of them jaazaniah the son of 
azzur  and pelatiah the son o f 
benaiah  princes of the people  2and 
he said unto me  son of man  these 
are the men that devise iniquity  and 
that give wicked counsel in this city  
3that say  the time is not near to build 
houses  this city is the caldron  and we 
are the flesh  4theref ore prophesy 
against them  prophesy  o son of 
man 5and the spirit of the lord fell upon me  and he said unto me  
speak  thus saith the lord thus 
have ye said  o house of israel  for i 
know the things that come into your 
mind  6ye have multiplied your s lain 
in this city  and ye have filled the 
streets thereof with the slain  
7therefore thus saith the lord g od 
your slain whom ye have laid in the 
midst of it  they are the flesh  and this 
city is the caldron  but ye shall be 
brought forth out of the midst of it  
8ye have feared the sword  and the 
sword will i bring upon you  saith the 
lord g od 9and i will bring you forth 
out of the midst thereof  and deliver 
you into the hands of strangers  and 
will execute judgments among you  
10ye shall fall by the sword  i will 
judge you upon the border of israel  
and ye shall know that i am the lord 
11though this city shall not be your 
caldron  ye shall be the flesh in the 
midst thereof  i will judge you upon 
the border of israel  12and ye shall 
know that i am the lord for ye have 
not walked in my statutes  neither 
have ye executed mine ordinances  but 
have done after the ordinances of the 
nations that are round about you  
13and it came to pass  when i 
prophesied  that pelatiah the son of 
benaiah died  then fell i dow n upon 
my face  and cried with a loud voice  
and said  ah lord g od wilt thou 
make a full end of the remnant of 
israel   
14and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  15son of man  as for 11 ezekiel  
773 
 thy brethren  even thy brethren  the 
men of thy kindred  and a ll the house 
of israel  all of them  concerning 
whom the inhabitants of jerusalem 
have said  get you far from the lord 
unto us is this land given for a 
possession  16therefore say  thus saith 
the lord g od although i have 
removed them far off among the 
nations  and although i have scattered 
them among the countries  yet have i 
been to them as a little sanctuary in the 
countries where they are come  
17therefore say  thus saith the lord 
god i will even gather you from the 
peoples  and assemble you out of th e 
countries where ye have been 
scattered  and i will give you the land 
of israel  18and they shall come 
thither  and they shall take away all the 
detestable things thereof and all the 
abominations thereof from thence  
19and i will give them one heart  and i 
will put a new spirit within you  and i 
will remove the stony heart out of their 
flesh  and will give them a heart of 
flesh  20that they may walk in my 
statutes  and keep mine ordinances  
and do them  and they shall be my 
people  and i will be their god  21but 
as for them whose heart walketh after 
the heart of their detestable things and 
their abominations  i will bring their 
way upon their own heads  saith the 
lord g od  
22then did the cherubim lift up their 
wings  and the wheels were beside 
them  and t he glory of the god of 
israel was over them above  23and the glory of the lord went up from the 
midst of the city  and stood upon the 
mountain which is on the east side of 
the city  24and a spirit lifted me up  
and brought me in the vision by the 
spirit of  god into chaldea  to them of 
the captivity  so the vision that i had 
seen went up from me  25then i spoke 
unto them of the captivity all the 
things that the lord had shown me   
the word of the lord also 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  thou dwellest  in the midst of 
the rebellious house  that have eyes to 
see and see not  that have ears to hear  
and hear not  for they are a rebellious 
house  3therefore  thou son of man  
prepare thee stuff for exile  and 
remove as though for exile by day in 
their sigh t and thou shalt remove from 
thy place to another place in their 
sight  it may be they will perceive  for 
they are a rebellious house  4and thou 
shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in 
their sight  as stuff for exile  and thou 
shalt go forth thyself at even  in their 
sight  as when men go forth into exile  
5dig thou through the wall in their 
sight  and carry out thereby  6in their 
sight shalt thou bear it upon thy 
shoulder  and carry it forth in the 
darkness  thou shalt cover thy face  
that thou see not the g round  for i have 
set thee for a sign unto the house of 
israel  7and i did so as i was 
commanded  i brought forth my stuff 
by day  as stuff for exile  and in the 
even i digged through the wall with 
my hand  i carried out in the darkness  12 ezekiel  
774 
 and bore it upon my shoulder in their 
sight   
8and in the morning came the word 
of the lord unto me  saying  9son of 
man hath not the house of israel  the 
rebellious house  said unto thee  what 
doest thou  10say thou unto them  
thus saith the lord g od concerning 
the pri nce even this burden  in 
jerusalem  and all the house of israel 
among whom they are  11say i am 
your sign  like as i have done  so shall 
it be done unto them they shall go 
into exile  into captivity  12and the 
prince that is among them shall bear 
upon hi s shoulder  and go forth in the 
darkness  they shall dig through the 
wall to carry out thereby  he shall 
cover his face  that he see not the 
ground with his eyes  13my net also 
will i spread upon him  and he shall be 
taken in my snare  and i will bring 
him to babylon to the land of the 
chaldeans  yet shall he not see it  
though he shall die there  14and i will 
disperse toward every wind all that are 
round about him to help him  and all 
his troops  and i will draw out the 
sword after them  15and they shall 
know that i am the lord when i shall 
scatter them among the nations  and 
disperse them in the countries  16but i 
will leave a few men of them from the 
sword  from the famine  and from the 
pestilence  that they may declare all 
their abominations among the n ations 
whither they come  and they shall 
know that i am the lord  17moreover the word of the lord 
came to me  saying  18son of man  eat 
thy bread with quaking  and drink thy 
water with trembling and with anxiety  
19and say unto the people of the land  
thus saith the lord g od concerning 
the inhabitants of jerusalem in the land 
of israel  they shall eat their bread 
with anxiety  and drink their water 
with appalment  that her land may be 
desolate from all that is therein  
because of the violence of all them  that 
dwell therein  20and the cities that are 
inhabited shall be laid waste  and the 
land shall be desolate  and ye shall 
know that i am the lord  
21and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  22son of man  what 
is that proverb that ye have in the l and 
of israel  saying  the days are 
prolonged  and every vision faileth  
23tell them therefore  thus saith the 
lord g od i will make this proverb to 
cease  and they shall no more use it as 
a proverb in israel  but say unto them  
the days are at hand  and t he word of 
every vision  24for there shall be no 
more any vain vision nor smooth 
divination within the house of israel  
25for i am the lord i will speak  what 
word soever it be that i shall speak  
and it shall be performed  it shall be no 
more delayed  for in your days  o 
rebellious house  will i speak the 
word  and will perform it  saith the 
lord g od  
26again the word of the lord came 
to me  saying  27son of man  behold  
they of the house of israel say  the ezekiel  
775 
 vision that he seeth is for many days to 
come  and he prophesieth of times that 
are far off  28therefore say unto them  
thus saith the lord g od there shall 
none of my words be delayed any 
more  but the word which i shall speak 
shall be performed  saith the lord 
god  
and the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  prophesy against the prophets 
of israel that prophesy  and say thou 
unto them that prophesy out of their 
own heart  hear ye the word of the 
lord 3thus saith the lord g od woe 
unto the vile prophets  that follow their 
own s pirit and things which they have 
not seen  4o israel  thy prophets have 
been like foxes in ruins  5ye have not 
gone up into the breaches  neither 
made up the hedge for the house of 
israel  to stand in the battle in the day 
of the lord 6they have seen van ity 
and lying divination  that say  the 
lord saith  and the lord hath not sent 
them  yet they hope that the word 
would be confirmed  7have ye not 
seen a vain vision  and have ye not 
spoken a lying divination  whereas ye 
say the lord saith  albeit i have n ot 
spoken   
8therefore thus saith the lord g od 
because ye have spoken vanity  and 
seen lies  therefore  behold  i am 
against you  saith the lord g od 9and 
my hand shall be against the prophets 
that see vanity  and that divine lies  
they shall not be in th e council of my 
people  neither shall they be written in the register of the house of israel  
neither shall they enter into the land of 
israel  and ye shall know that i am the 
lord g od 10because  even because 
they have led my people astray  
saying  peace  and there is no peace  
and when it buildeth up a slight wall  
behold  they daub it with whited 
plaster  11say unto them that daub it 
with whited plaster  that it shall fall  
there shall be an overflowing shower  
and ye  o great hailstones  shall fall  
and a stormy wind shall break forth  
12and lo when the wall is fallen  shall 
it not be said unto you  where is the 
daubing wherewith ye have daubed it  
13therefore thus saith the lord g od i 
will even cause a stormy wind to break 
forth in my fury  and there  shall be an 
overflowing shower in mine anger  
and great hailstones in fury to 
consume it  14so will i break down the 
wall that ye have daubed with whited 
plaster  and bring it down to the 
ground  so that the foundation thereof 
shall be uncovered  and it s hall fall  
and ye shall be consumed in the midst 
thereof  and ye shall know that i am 
the lord 15thus will i spend my fury 
upon the wall  and upon them that 
have daubed it with whited plaster  
and i will say unto you  the wall is no 
more  neither they tha t daubed it  16to 
wit the prophets of israel that 
prophesy concerning jerusalem  and 
that see visions of peace for her  and 
there is no peace  saith the lord g od  
17and thou  son of man  set thy face 
against the daughters of thy people  13 ezekiel  
776 
 that prophesy out  of their own heart  
and prophesy thou against them  18and 
say thus saith the lord g od woe to 
the women that sew cushions upon all 
elbows  and make pads for the head of 
persons of every stature to hunt souls  
will ye hunt the souls of my people  
and save  souls alive for yourselves  
19and ye have profaned me among my 
people for handfuls of barley and for 
crumbs of bread  to slay the souls that 
should not die  and to save the souls 
alive that should not live  by your 
lying to my people that hearken unto 
lies 20wherefore thus saith the lord 
god behold  i am against your 
cushions  wherewith ye hunt the souls 
as birds  and i will tear them from your 
arms  and i will let the souls go  even 
the souls that ye hunt as birds  21your 
pads also will i tear  and deli ver my 
people out of your hand  and they shall 
be no more in your hand to be hunted  
and ye shall know that i am the lord 
22because with lies ye have cowed the 
heart of the righteous  when i have not 
grieved him  and strengthened the 
hands of the wicked  that he should not 
return from his wicked way  that he be 
saved alive  23therefore ye shall no 
more see vanity  nor divine 
divinations  and i will deliver my 
people out of your hand  and ye shall 
know that i am the lord  
then came certain of the 
elder s of israel unto me  and 
sat before me  2and the word of the 
lord came unto me  saying  3son of 
man these men have set up their idols in their mind  and put the 
stumblingblock of their iniquity before 
their face  should i be inquired of at all 
by them  4therefore speak unto them  
and say unto them  thus saith the lord 
god every man of the house of israel 
that setteth up his idols in his mind  
and putteth the stumblingblock of his 
iniquity before his face  and cometh to 
the prophet i the lord will answer 
him that cometh according to the 
multitude of his idols  5that i may take 
the house of israel in their own heart  
because they are all turned away from 
me through their idols   
6therefore say unto the house of 
israel  thus saith the lord g od return 
ye and turn yourselves from your 
idols  and turn away your faces from 
all your abominations  7for every one 
of the house of israel  or of the 
strangers that sojourn in israel  that 
separateth himself from me  and 
taketh his idols into his heart  and 
putteth the  stumblingblock of his 
iniquity before his face  and cometh to 
the prophet  that he inquire for him of 
mei the lord will answer him by 
myself  8and i will set my face against 
that man  and will make him a sign 
and a proverb  and i will cut him off 
from th e midst of my people  and ye 
shall know that i am the lord 9and 
when the prophet is enticed and 
speaketh a word  i the lord have 
enticed that prophet  and i will stretch 
out my hand upon him  and will 
destroy him from the midst of my 
people israel  10and they shall bear 14 ezekiel  
777 
 their iniquity  the iniquity of the 
prophet shall be even as the iniquity of 
him that inquireth  11that the house of 
israel may go no more astray from me  
neither defile themselves any more 
with all their transgressions  but that 
they may b e my people  and i may be 
their god  saith the lord g od  
12and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  13son of man  when 
a land sinneth against me by 
trespassing grievously  and i stretch 
out my hand upon it  and break the 
staff of the bread thereof  and send 
famine upon it  and cut off from it man 
and beast  14though these three men  
noah  daniel  and job  were in it  they 
should deliver but their own souls by 
their righteousness  saith the lord 
god 15if i cause evil beasts to pass 
through the land  and they bereave it  
and it be desolate  so that no man may 
pass through because of the beasts  
16though these three men were in it  as 
i live  saith the lord g od they shall 
deliver neither sons nor daughters  
they only shall be delivered  but the 
land shall be desolate  17or if i bring a 
sword upon that land  and say  let the 
sword go through the land  so that i cut 
off from it man and beast  18though 
these three men were in it  as i live  
saith the lord g od they shall deliver 
neither sons nor daughter s but they 
only shall be delivered themselves  
19or if i send a pestilence into that 
land and pour out my fury upon it in 
blood  to cut off from it man and beast  
20though noah  daniel  and job  were in it as i live  saith the lord g od they 
shall deliv er neither son nor daughter  
they shall but deliver their own souls 
by their righteousness  21for thus saith 
the lord g od how much more when i 
send my four sore judgments against 
jerusalem  the sword  and the famine  
and the evil beasts  and the pestilenc e 
to cut off from it man and beast  
22and behold  though there be left a 
remnant therein that shall be brought 
forth  both sons and daughters  behold  
when they come forth unto you  and ye 
see their way and their doings  then ye 
shall be comforted concer ning the evil 
that i have brought upon jerusalem  
even concerning all that i have brought 
upon it  23and they shall comfort you  
when ye see their way and their 
doings  and ye shall know that i have 
not done without cause all that i have 
done in it  saith the lord g od  
and the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  what is the vine tree more 
than any tree  the vine branch which 
grew up among the trees of the forest  
3shall wood be taken thereof to make 
any work  or will men take a pin of it 
to hang any vessel thereon  4behold  it 
is cast into the fire for fuel  the fire 
hath devoured both the ends of it  and 
the midst of it is singed  is it profitable 
for any work  5behold  when it was 
whole  it was meet for no work  how 
much less  when th e fire hath devoured 
it and it is singed  shall it yet be meet 
for any work  6therefore thus saith the 
lord g od as the vine tree among the 15 ezekiel  
778 
 trees of the forest  which i have given 
to the fire for fuel  so do i give the 
inhabitants of jerusalem  7and i wil l 
set my face against them  out of the 
fire are they come forth  and the fire 
shall devour them  and ye shall know 
that i am the lord when i set my face 
against them  8and i will make the 
land desolate  because they have acted 
treacherously  saith the lor d g od  
again the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  cause jerusalem to know her 
abominations  3and say  thus saith the 
lord g od unto jerusalem  thine origin 
and thy nativity is of the land of the 
canaanite  the amorite was thy father  
and thy mother was a hittite  4and as 
for thy nativity  in the day thou wast 
born thy navel was not cut  neither 
wast thou washed in water for 
cleansing  thou was not salted at all  
nor swaddled at all  5no eye pitied 
thee to do any of these unto thee  to 
have compassion upon thee  but thou 
wast cast out in the open field in the 
loathsomeness of thy person  in the 
day that thou wast born   
6and when i passed by thee  and 
saw thee wallowing in thy blood  i 
said unto thee  in thy blood  live yea 
i said u nto thee  in thy blood  live 7i 
cause thee to increase  even as the 
growth of the field  and thou didst 
increase and grow up  and thou camest 
to excellent beauty  thy breasts were 
fashioned  and thy hair was grown  yet 
thou wast naked and bare  8now when 
i passed by thee  and looked upon thee and behold  thy time was the 
time of love  i spread my skirt over 
thee and covered thy nakedness  yea i 
swore unto thee  and entered into a 
covenant with thee  saith the lord 
god and thou becamest mine  9then 
washed i thee with water  yea i 
cleansed away thy blood from thee  
and i anointed thee with oil  10i clothed 
thee also with richly woven work  and 
shod thee with sealskin  and i wound 
fine linen about thy head  and covered 
thee with silk  11i decked thee als o 
with ornaments  and i put bracelets 
upon thy hands  and a chain on thy 
neck  12and i put a ring upon thy nose  
and earrings in thine ears  and a 
beautiful crown upon thy head  13thus 
wast thou decked with gold and silver  
and thy raiment was of fine line n and 
silk and richly woven work  thou didst 
eat fine flour  and honey  and oil  and 
thou didst wax exceeding beautiful  
and thou wast meet for royal estate  
14and thy renown went forth among 
the nations for thy beauty  for it was 
perfect  through my spl endour which i 
had put upon thee  saith the lord g od  
15but thou didst trust in thy beauty 
and play the harlot because of thy 
renown  and didst pour out thy 
harlotries on every one that passed by  
his it was  16and thou didst take of thy 
garments  and did st make for thee high 
places decked with divers colours  and 
didst play the harlot upon them  the 
like things shall not come  neither shall 
it be so  17thou didst also take thy fair 
jewels of my gold and of my silver  16 ezekiel  
779 
 which i had given thee  and madest for  
thee images of men  and didst play the 
harlot with them  18and thou didst take 
thy richly woven garments and cover 
them  and didst set mine oil and mine 
incense before them  19my bread also 
which i gave thee  fine flour  and oil  
and honey  wherewith i fe d thee  thou 
didst even set it before them for a 
sweet savour  and thus it was  saith the 
lord g od 20moreover thou hast taken 
thy sons and thy daughters  whom thou 
hast borne unto me  and these hast 
thou sacrificed unto them to be 
devoured  were thy harlo tries a small 
matter  21that thou hast slain my 
children  and delivered them up  in 
setting them apart unto them  22and in 
all thine abominations and thy 
harlotries thou hast not remembered 
the days of thy youth  when thou wast 
naked and bare  and wast wal lowing in 
thy blood  23and it came to pass after 
all thy wickedness woe woe unto 
thee saith the lord g od 24that thou 
hast built unto thee an eminent place  
and hast made thee a lofty place in 
every street  25thou hast built thy lofty 
place at every head  of the way  and 
hast made thy beauty an abomination  
and hast opened thy feet to every one 
that passed by  and multiplied thy 
harlotries  26thou hast also played the 
harlot with the egyptians  thy 
neighbours  great of flesh  and hast 
multiplied thy harlot ry to provoke me  
27behold  therefore i have stretched 
out my hand over thee  and have 
diminished thine allowance  and delivered thee unto the will of them 
that hate thee  the daughters of the 
philistines  that are ashamed of thy 
lewd way  28thou hast pla yed the 
harlot also with the assyrians  without 
having enough  yea thou hast played 
the harlot with them  and yet thou wast 
not satisfied  29thou hast moreover 
multiplied thy harlotry with the land of 
traffic  even with chaldea  and yet 
thou didst not hav e enough herewith  
30how weak is thy heart  saith the lord 
god seeing thou doest all these things  
the work of a wanton harlot  31in that 
thou buildest thine eminent place in 
the head of every way  and makest thy 
lofty place in every street  and hast not 
been as a harlot that enhanceth her 
hire 32thou wife that committest 
adultery  that takest strangers instead 
of thy husband  33to all harlots gifts 
are given  but thou hast given thy gifts 
to all thy lovers  and hast bribed them 
to come unto thee from eve ry side in 
thy harlotries  34and the contrary is in 
thee from other women  in that thou 
didst solicit to harlotry  and wast not 
solicited  and in that thou givest hire  
and no hire is given unto thee  thus 
thou art contrary   
35wherefore  o harlot  hear th e word 
of the lord 36thus saith the lord 
god because thy filthiness was 
poured out  and thy nakedness 
uncovered through thy harlotries with 
thy lovers  and because of all the idols 
of thy abominations  and for the blood 
of thy children  that thou didst g ive 
unto them  37therefore behold  i will ezekiel  
780 
 gather all thy lovers  unto whom thou 
hast been pleasant  and all them that 
thou hast loved  with all them that thou 
hast hated  i will even gather them 
against thee from every side  and will 
uncover thy nakedness unto them  that 
they may see all thy nakedness  38and 
i will judge thee  as women that break 
wedlock and shed blood are judged  
and i will bring upon thee the blood of 
fury and jealousy  39i will also give 
thee into their hand  and they shall 
throw down th ine eminent place  and 
break down thy lofty places  and they 
shall strip thee of thy clothes  and take 
thy fair jewels  and they shall leave 
thee naked and bare  40they shall also 
bring up an assembly against thee  and 
they shall stone thee with stones  and 
thrust thee through with their swords  
41and they shall burn thy houses with 
fire and execute judgments upon thee 
in the sight of many women  and i will 
cause thee to cease from playing the 
harlot  and thou shalt also give no hire 
any more  42so will i satisfy my fury 
upon thee  and my jealousy shall 
depart from thee  and i will be quiet  
and will be no more angry  43because 
thou hast not remembered the days of 
thy youth  but hast fretted me in all 
these things  lo therefore i also will 
bring thy way up on thy head  saith the 
lord g od or hast thou not committed 
this lewdness above all thine 
abominations   
44behold  every one that useth 
proverbs shall use this proverb against 
thee saying  as the mother  so her daughter  45thou art thy mother s 
daughter  that loatheth her husband 
and her children  and thou art the sister 
of thy sisters  who loathed their 
husbands and their children  your 
mother was a hittite  and your father 
an amorite  46and thine elder sister is 
samaria  that dwelleth at thy left hand  
she and her daughters  and thy 
younger sister  that dwelleth at thy 
right hand  is sodom and her 
daughters  47yet hast thou not walked 
in their ways  nor done after their 
abominations  but in a very little while 
thou didst deal more corruptly than 
they in a ll thy ways  48as i live  saith 
the lord g od sodom thy sister hath 
not done  she nor her daughters  as 
thou hast done  thou and thy 
daughters  49behold  this was the 
iniquity of thy sister sodom  pride  
fulness of bread  and careless ease was 
in her and i n her daughters  neither did 
she strengthen the hand of the poor 
and needy  50and they were haughty  
and committed abomination before 
me therefore i removed them when i 
saw it  51neither hath samaria 
committed even half of thy sins  but 
thou hast multipli ed thine 
abominations more than they  and hast 
justified thy sisters by all thine 
abominations which thou hast done  
52thou also  bear thine own shame  in 
that thou hast given judgment for thy 
sisters  through thy sins that thou hast 
committed more abomina ble than they  
they are more righteous than thou  yea 
be thou also confounded  and bear thy ezekiel  
781 
 shame  in that thou hast justified thy 
sisters   
53and i will turn their captivity  the 
captivity of sodom and her daughters  
and the captivity of samaria and her 
daughters  and the captivity of thy 
captives in the midst of them  54that 
thou mayest bear thine own shame  
and mayest be ashamed because of all 
that thou hast done  in that thou art a 
comfort unto them  55and thy sisters  
sodom and her daughters  shall re turn 
to their former estate  and samaria and 
her daughters shall return to their 
former estate  and thou and thy 
daughters shall return to your former 
estate  56for thy sister sodom was not 
mentioned by thy mouth in the day of 
thy pride  57before thy wicke dness was 
uncovered  as at the time of the taunt 
of the daughters of aram  and of all 
that are round about her  the daughters 
of the philistines  that have thee in 
disdain round about  58thou hast borne 
thy lewdness and thine abominations  
saith the lord  
59for thus saith the lord g od i will 
even deal with thee as thou hast done  
who hast despised the oath in breaking 
the covenant  60nevertheless i will 
remember my covenant with thee in 
the days of thy youth  and i will 
establish unto thee an everlasting 
covenant  61then shalt thou remember 
thy ways  and be ashamed  when thou 
shalt receive thy sisters  thine elder 
sisters and thy younger  and i will give 
them unto thee for daughters  but not 
because of thy covenant  62and i will establish my covenant with thee and 
thou shalt know that i am the lord 
63that thou mayest remember  and be 
confounded  and never open thy mouth 
any more  because of thy shame  when 
i have forgiven thee all that thou hast 
done  saith the lord g od  
and the word of the lord 
came  unto me  saying  2son 
of man  put forth a riddle  and speak a 
parable unto the house of israel  3and 
say thus saith the lord g od  
a great eagle with great wings  
and long pinions   
full of feathers  which had divers 
colours   
came unto lebanon   
and to ok the top of the cedar   
4he cropped off the topmost of the 
young twigs thereof   
and carried it into a land of traffic   
he set it in a city of merchants   
5he took also of the seed of the 
land  
and planted it in a fruitful soil   
he placed it beside ma ny waters   
he set it as a slip   
6and it grew  and became a 
spreading vine  
of low stature   
whose tendrils might turn toward 
him  
and the roots thereof be under him   
so it became a vine  and brought 
forth branches   
and shot forth sprigs   
 
7there was also another great eagle 
with great wings  17 ezekiel  
782 
 and many feathers   
and behold  this vine did bend  
its roots toward him   
and shot forth its branches toward 
him from the beds of its 
plantation   
that he might water it   
8it was planted in a good soil  
by man y waters   
that it might bring forth branches  
and that it might bear fruit   
that it might be a stately vine   
9say thou  thus saith the lord g od 
shall it prosper   
shall he not pull up the roots 
thereof   
and cut off the fruit thereof  that it 
wither   
yea wither in all its sprouting 
leaves   
neither shall great power or much 
people be at hand  
when it is plucked up by the roots 
thereof   
10yea behold  being planted  shall it 
prosper   
shall it not utterly wither  when the 
east wind toucheth it   
in the beds where it grew it shall 
wither   
11moreover the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  12say now to 
the rebellious house  know ye not 
what these things mean  tell them  
behold  the king of babylon came to 
jerusalem  and took the king thereof  
and t he princes thereof  and brought 
them to him to babylon  13and he took 
of the seed royal  and made a covenant with him  and brought him under an 
oath and the mighty of the land he 
took away  14that his might be a lowly 
kingdom  that it might not lift itsel f up 
but that by keeping his covenant it 
might stand  15but he rebelled against 
him in sending his ambassadors into 
egypt  that they might give him horses 
and much people  shall he prosper  
shall he escape that doeth such things  
shall he break the covena nt and yet 
escape  16as i live  saith the lord g od 
surely in the place where the king 
dwelleth that made him king  whose 
oath he despised  and whose covenant 
he broke  even with him in the midst 
of babylon he shall die  17neither shall 
pharaoh with his m ighty army and 
great company succour him in the war  
when they cast up mounds and build 
forts to cut off many souls  18seeing he 
hath despised the oath by breaking the 
covenant  when  lo he had given his 
hand  and hath done all these things  
he shall not  escape  19therefore thus 
saith the lord g od as i live  surely 
mine oath that he hath despised  and 
my covenant that he hath broken  i 
will even bring it upon his own head  
20and i will spread my net upon him  
and he shall be taken in my snare  and 
i will  bring him to babylon  and will 
plead with him there for his treachery 
that he hath committed against me  
21and all his mighty men in all his 
bands shall fall by the sword  and they 
that remain shall be scattered toward 
every wind  and ye shall know that i  
the lord have spoken it  22thus saith ezekiel  
783 
 the lord g od moreover i will take  
even i  of the lofty top of the cedar  
and will set it  i will crop off from the 
topmost of its young twigs a tender 
one and i will plant it upon a high 
mountain and eminent  23in the 
mountain of the height of israel will i 
plant it  and it shall bring forth boughs  
and bear fruit  and be a stately cedar  
and under it shall dwell all fowl of 
every wing  in the shadow of the 
branches thereof shall they dwell  
24and all the trees of t he field shall 
know that i the lord have brought 
down the high tree  have exalted the 
low tree  have dried up the green tree  
and have made the dry tree to flourish  
i the lord have spoken and have done 
it  
and the word of the lord 
came unto me  sayin g 2what 
mean ye  that ye use this proverb in the 
land of israel  saying   
the fathers have eaten sour grapes   
and the children s teeth are set on 
edge   
3as i live  saith the lord g od ye shall 
not have occasion any more to use this 
proverb in israel  4behold  all souls are 
mine  as the soul of the father  so also 
the soul of the son is mine  the soul 
that sinneth  it shall die   
5but if a man be just  and do that 
which is lawful and right  6and hath 
not eaten upon the mountains  neither 
hath lifted up h is eyes to the idols of 
the house of israel  neither hath defiled 
his neighbour s wife  neither hath 
come near to a woman in her impurity  7and hath not wronged any  but hath 
restored his pledge for a debt  hath 
taken nought by robbery  hath given 
his brea d to the hungry  and hath 
covered the naked with a garment  8he 
that hath not given forth upon interest  
neither hath taken any increase  that 
hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity  
hath executed true justice between 
man and man  9hath walked in my 
statute s and hath kept mine 
ordinances  to deal truly  he is just  he 
shall surely live  saith the lord g od  
10if he beget a son that is a robber  a 
shedder of blood  and that doeth to a 
brother any of these things  11whereas 
he himself had not done any of thes e 
things  for he hath even eaten upon the 
mountains  and defiled his neighbour s 
wife 12hath wronged the poor and 
needy  hath taken by robbery  hath not 
restored the pledge  and hath lifted up 
his eyes to the idols  hath committed 
abomination  13hath give n forth upon 
interest  and hath taken increase  shall 
he then live  he shall not live he hath 
done all these abominations  he shall 
surely be put to death  his blood shall 
be upon him   
14now  lo if he beget a son  that 
seeth all his father s sins  which he 
hath done  and considereth  and doeth 
not such like  15that hath not eaten 
upon the mountains  neither hath lifted 
up his eyes to the idols of the house of 
israel  hath not defiled his neighbour s 
wife 16neither hath wronged any  hath 
not taken aught t o pledge  neither hath 
taken by robbery  but hath given his 18 ezekiel  
784 
 bread to the hungry  and hath covered 
the naked with a garment  17that hath 
withdrawn his hand from the poor  that 
hath not received interest nor increase  
hath executed mine ordinances  hath 
walk ed in my statutes  he shall not die 
for the iniquity of his father  he shall 
surely live  18as for his father  because 
he cruelly oppressed  committed 
robbery on his brother  and did that 
which is not good among his people  
behold  he dieth for his iniquit y 19yet 
say ye  why doth not the son bear the 
iniquity of the father with him  when 
the son hath done that which is lawful 
and right  and hath kept all my 
statutes  and hath done them  he shall 
surely live  20the soul that sinneth  it 
shall die  the son s hall not bear the 
iniquity of the father with him  neither 
shall the father bear the iniquity of the 
son with him  the righteousness of the 
righteous shall be upon him  and the 
wickedness of the wicked shall be 
upon him   
21but if the wicked turn from all his 
sins that he hath committed  and keep 
all my statutes  and do that which is 
lawful and right  he shall surely live  
he shall not die  22none of his 
transgressions that he hath committed 
shall be remembered against him  for 
his righteousness that he hat h done he 
shall live  23have i any pleasure at all 
that the wicked should die  saith the 
lord g od and not rather that he 
should return from his ways  and live   
24but when the righteous turneth 
away from his righteousness  and committeth iniquity  and doe th 
according to all the abominations that 
the wicked man doeth  shall he live  
none of his righteous deeds that he 
hath done shall be remembered  for his 
trespass that he trespassed  and for his 
sin that he hath sinned  for them shall 
he die  25yet ye say  the way of the 
lord is not equal  hear now  o house 
of israel  is it my way that is not 
equal  is it not your ways that are 
unequal  26when the righteous man 
turneth away from his righteousness  
and committeth iniquity  he shall die 
therefor  for his iniq uity that he hath 
done shall he die  27again  when the 
wicked man turneth away from his 
wickedness that he hath committed  
and doeth that which is lawful and 
right  he shall save his soul alive  
28because he considereth  and turneth 
away from all his trans gressions that 
he hath committed  he shall surely 
live he shall not die  29yet saith the 
house of israel  the way of the lord is 
not equal  o house of israel  is it my 
ways that are not equal  is it not your 
ways that are unequal  30therefore i 
will judge  you o house of israel  
every one according to his ways  saith 
the lord g od return ye  and turn 
yourselves from all your 
transgressions  so shall they not be a 
stumblingblock of iniquity unto you  
31cast away from you all your 
transgressions  wherein ye have 
transgressed  and make you a new 
heart and a new spirit  for why will ye 
die o house of israel  32for i have no ezekiel  
785 
 pleasure in the death of him that dieth  
saith the lord g od wherefore turn 
yourselves  and live   
moreover  take thou up a 
lamentation  for the princes of 
israel  2and say   
how was thy mother a lioness   
among lions she couched   
in the midst of the young lions  
she reared her whelps   
3and she brought up one of her 
whelps   
he became a young lion   
and he learned to catch the prey   
he devoured men   
4then the nations assembled against 
him  
he was taken in their pit   
and they brought him with hooks  
unto the land of egypt   
 
5now when she saw that she was 
disappointed   
and her hope was lost   
then she took another of her 
whelps   
and made him a young lion   
6and he went up and down among 
the lions   
he became a young lion   
and he learned to catch the prey   
he devoured men   
7and he knew their castles   
and laid waste their cities   
and the land was desolate   
and the fulness thereof   
because of the noise of his roaring   
 8then the nations cried out against 
him  
on every side from the provinces   
and they spread their net over him   
he was taken in their pit   
9and they put him in a cage with 
hooks   
and brought him to the king of 
babylon   
that they might bring him into 
strongholds   
so that his voice should no more be 
heard  
upon the mountains of israel   
 
10thy mother was like a vine  in thy 
likeness   
planted by the waters   
she was fruitful and full of branches  
by reason of many  waters   
11and she had strong rods  
to be sceptres for them that bore 
rule  
and her stature was exalted  
among the thick branches   
and she was seen in her height  
with the multitude of her tendrils   
12but she was plucked up in fury   
she was cast down to the ground   
and the east wind dried up her fruit   
her strong rods were broken off and 
withered   
the fire consumed her   
13and now she is planted in the 
wilderness   
in a dry and thirsty ground   
14and fire is gone out of the rod of 
her branches   
it hath devoured her fruit   19 ezekiel  
786 
 so that there is in her no strong rod  
to be a sceptre to rule   
this is a lamentation  and it was for a 
lamentation   
and it came to pass in the 
seventh year  in the fifth 
month  the tenth day of the month  that 
certain of th e elders of israel came to 
inquire of the lord and sat before me  
2and the word of the lord came unto 
me saying  3son of man  speak unto 
the elders of israel  and say unto them  
thus saith the lord g od are ye come 
to inquire of me  as i live  saith the  
lord g od i will not be inquired of by 
you 4wilt thou judge them  son of 
man wilt thou judge them  cause them 
to know the abominations of their 
fathers  5and say unto them  thus saith 
the lord g od in the day when i chose 
israel  and lifted up my hand u nto the 
seed of the house of jacob  and made 
myself known unto them in the land of 
egypt  when i lifted up my hand unto 
them  saying  i am the lord your god  
6in that day i lifted up my hand unto 
them  to bring them forth out of the 
land of egypt into a la nd that i had 
sought out for them  flowing with milk 
and honey  which is the beauty of all 
lands  7and i said unto them  cast ye 
away every man the detestable things 
of his eyes  and defile not yourselves 
with the idols of egypt  i am the lord 
your god  8but they rebelled against 
me and would not hearken unto me  
they did not every man cast away the 
detestable things of their eyes  neither 
did they forsake the idols of egypt  then i said i would pour out my fury 
upon them  to spend my anger upon 
them in th e midst of the land of egypt  
9but i wrought for my name s sake  
that it should not be profaned in the 
sight of the nations  among whom they 
were  in whose sight i made myself 
known unto them  so as to bring them 
forth out of the land of egypt  10so i 
caused them to go forth out of the land 
of egypt  and brought them into the 
wilderness  11and i gave them my 
statutes  and taught them mine 
ordinances  which if a man do  he shall 
live by them  12moreover also i gave 
them my sabbaths  to be a sign 
between me a nd them  that they might 
know that i am the lord that sanctify 
them  13but the house of israel rebelled 
against me in the wilderness  they 
walked not in my statutes  and they 
rejected mine ordinances  which if a 
man do  he shall live by them  and my 
sabbat hs they greatly profaned  then i 
said i would pour out my fury upon 
them in the wilderness  to consume 
them  14but i wrought for my name s 
sake that it should not be profaned in 
the sight of the nations  in whose sight 
i brought them out  15yet also i lif ted 
up my hand unto them in the 
wilderness  that i would not bring 
them into the land which i had given 
them  flowing with milk and honey  
which is the beauty of all lands  
16because they rejected mine 
ordinances  and walked not in my 
statutes  and profane d my sabbaths 
for their heart went after their idols  20 ezekiel  
787 
 17nevertheless mine eye spared them 
from destroying them  neither did i 
make a full end of them in the 
wilderness  18and i said unto their 
children in the wilderness  walk ye 
not in the statutes of your  fathers  
neither observe their ordinances  nor 
defile yourselves with their idols  19i 
am the lord your god  walk in my 
statutes  and keep mine ordinances  
and do them  20and hallow my 
sabbaths  and they shall be a sign 
between me and you  that ye may 
know that i am the lord your god  
21but the children rebelled against me  
they walked not in my statutes  neither 
kept mine ordinances to do them  
which if a man do  he shall live by 
them  they profaned my sabbaths  then 
i said i would pour out my fury upon 
them to spend my anger upon them in 
the wilderness  22nevertheless i 
withdrew my hand  and wrought for 
my name s sake  that it should not be 
profaned in the sight of the nations  in 
whose sight i brought them forth  23i 
lifted up my hand unto them also in 
the wilderness  that i would scatter 
them among the nations  and disperse 
them through the countries  24because 
they had not executed mine 
ordinances  but had rejected my 
statutes  and had profaned my 
sabbaths  and their eyes were after 
their fathers idols  25wherefore i gave 
them also statutes that were not good  
and ordinances whereby they should 
not live  26and i polluted them in their 
own gifts  in that they set apart all that openeth the womb  that i might 
destroy them  to the end that they 
might know that i am the lord 
27therefore  son of man  speak unto 
the house of israel  and say unto them  
thus saith the lord g od in this 
moreover have your fathers 
blasphemed me  in that they dealt 
treacherously with me  28for when i 
had brought them into the land  which 
i lifted up my hand to give unto them  
then they saw every high hill  and 
every thick tree  and they offered there 
their sacrifices  and there they 
presented the provocation of their 
offering  there also they made their 
sweet savour  and there they  poured 
out their drink offerings  29then i said 
unto them  what meaneth the high 
place whereunto ye go  so the name 
thereof is called bamah unto this day   
30wherefore say unto the house of 
israel  thus saith the lord g od when 
ye pollute yourselves after  the manner 
of your fathers  and go after their 
abominations  31and when  in offering 
your gifts  in making your sons to pass 
through the fire  ye pollute yourselves 
with all your idols  unto this day  shall 
i then be inquired of by you  o house 
of israel  as i live  saith the lord g od 
i will not be inquired of by you  32and 
that which cometh into your mind 
shall not be at all  in that ye say  we 
will be as the nations  as the families 
of the countries  to serve wood and 
stone  33as i live  saith the lord god 
surely with a mighty hand  and with an 
outstretched arm  and with fury poured ezekiel  
788 
 out will i be king over you  34and i 
will bring you out from the peoples  
and will gather you out of the 
countries wherein ye are scattered  
with a mighty hand  and with an  
outstretched arm  and with fury poured 
out 35and i will bring you into the 
wilderness of the peoples  and there 
will i plead with you face to face  
36like as i pleaded with your fathers in 
the wilderness of the land of egypt  so 
will i plead with you  saith the lord 
god 37and i will cause you to pass 
under the rod  and i will bring you into 
the bond of the covenant  38and i will 
purge out from among you the rebels  
and them that transgress against me  i 
will bring them forth out of the land 
where they so journ  but they shall not 
enter into the land of israel  and ye 
shall know that i am the lord 39as for 
you o house of israel  thus saith the 
lord g od go ye  serve every one his 
idols  even because ye will not hearken 
unto me  but my holy name shall ye 
no more profane with your gifts  and 
with your idols  40for in my holy 
mountain  in the mountain of the 
height of israel  saith the lord g od 
there shall all the house of israel  all of 
them  serve me in the land  there will i 
accept them  and there will i require 
your heave offerings  and the first of 
your gifts  with all your holy things  
41with your sweet savour will i accept 
you when i bring you out from the 
peoples  and gather you out of the 
countries wherein ye have been 
scattered  and i will be sanct ified in you in the sight of the nations  42and 
ye shall know that i am the lord 
when i shall bring you into the land of 
israel  into the country which i lifted 
up my hand to give unto your fathers  
43and there shall ye remember your 
ways  and all your do ings wherein ye 
have polluted yourselves  and ye shall 
loathe yourselves in your own sight for 
all your evils that ye have committed  
44and ye shall know that i am the 
lord when i have wrought with you 
for my name s sake  not according to 
your evil ways  nor according to your 
corrupt doings  o ye house of israel  
saith the lord g od  
and the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  set thy face toward the south  
and preach toward the south  and 
prophesy against the forest of the field 
in the south  3and say to the forest of 
the south  hear the word of the lord 
thus saith the lord g od behold  i 
will kindle a fire in thee  and it shall 
devour every green tree in thee  and 
every dry tree  it shall not be 
quenched  even a flaming flame  and 
all faces from the south to the north 
shall be seared thereby  4all flesh shall 
see that i the lord have kindled it  it 
shall not be quenched  5then said i  
ah lord g od they say of me  is he 
not a maker of parables   
6then the word of the lord came 
unto me saying  7son of man  set thy 
face toward jerusalem  and preach 
toward the sanctuaries  and prophesy 
against the land of israel  8say to the 21 ezekiel  
789 
 land of israel  thus saith the lord 
behold  i am against thee  and will 
draw forth my sword out of its sheath  
and will cut off from thee the righteous 
and the wicked  9seeing then that i will 
cut off from thee the righteous and the 
wicked  therefore shall my sword go 
forth out of its sheath against all flesh 
from the south to the north  10and all 
flesh shall kno w that i the lord have 
drawn forth my sword out of its 
sheath  it shall not return any more  
11sigh therefore  thou son of man  with 
the breaking of thy loins and with 
bitterness shalt thou sigh before their 
eyes 12and it shall be  when they say 
unto thee  wherefore sighest thou  
that thou shalt say  because of the 
tidings  for it cometh  and every heart 
shall melt  and all hands shall be slack  
and every spirit shall be faint  and all 
knees shall drip with water  behold  it 
cometh  and it shall be done  saith the 
lord g od  
13and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  14son of man  
prophesy  and say  thus saith the 
lord say  
a sword  a sword  it is sharpened   
and also furbished   
15it is sharpened that it may make a 
sore slaughter   
it is furbishe d that it may glitter  
or shall we make mirth  
against the rod of my son  
contemning every tree   
16 and it is given to be furbished   
that it may be handled   
the sword  it is sharpened   yea it is furbished   
to give it into the hand of the 
slayer   
17cry and wail  son of man  for it is 
upon my people  it is upon all the 
princes of israel  they are thrust down 
to the sword with my people  smite 
therefore upon thy thigh  18for there is 
a trial  and what if it contemn even the 
rod it shall be no more  saith the lord 
god 19thou therefore  son of man  
prophesy  and smite thy hands 
together  and let the sword be doubled 
the third time  the sword of those to be 
slain  it is the sword of the great one 
that is to be slain  which compasseth 
them about  20i have  set the point of 
the sword against all their gates  that 
their heart may melt  and their 
stumblings be multiplied  ah it is 
made glittering  it is sharpened for 
slaughter  21go thee one way to the 
right  or direct thyself to the left  
whither is thy face  set 22i will also 
smite my hands together  and i will 
satisfy my fury  i the lord have 
spoken it   
23and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  24now  thou son of 
man make thee two ways  that the 
sword of the king of babylon may 
come  they twain s hall come forth out 
of one land  and mark a signpost  mark 
it clear at the head of the way to the 
city 25thou shalt make a way  that the 
sword may come to rabbah of the 
children of ammon  and to judah in 
jerusalem the fortified  26for the king 
of babylon standeth at the parting of ezekiel  
790 
 the way  at the head of the two ways  
to use divination  he shaketh the 
arrows to and fro  he inquireth of the 
teraphim  he looketh in the liver  27in 
his right hand is the lot jerusalem  to 
set battering rams  to open the mouth 
for the slaughter  to lift up the voice 
with shouting  to set battering rams 
against the gates  to cast up mounds  to 
build forts  28and it shall be unto them 
as a false divination in their sight  who 
have weeks upon weeks  but it 
bringeth iniquity to reme mbrance  that 
they may be taken   
29therefore thus saith the lord g od 
because ye have made your iniquity to 
be remembered  in that your 
transgressions are uncovered  so that 
your sins do appear in all your doings  
because that ye are come to 
remembrance  ye shall be taken with 
the hand  30and thou  o wicked one  
that art to be slain  the prince of israel  
whose day is come  in the time of the 
iniquity of the end  31thus saith the 
lord g od the mitre shall be removed  
and the crown taken off  this shall be 
no more the same  that which is low 
shall be exalted  and that which is high 
abased  32a ruin  a ruin  a ruin  will i 
make it  this also shall be no more  
until he come whose right it is  and i 
will give it him   
33and thou  son of man  prophesy  
and say  thus saith the lord g od 
concerning the children of ammon  
and concerning their taunt  and say 
thou  
o sword  o sword keen edged   furbished for the slaughter   
to the uttermost  because of the 
glitterings   
34while they see falsehood unto 
thee  
while the y divine lies unto thee   
to lay thee upon the necks of the 
wicked that are to be slain   
whose day is come  in the time of 
the iniquity of the end   
35cause it to return into its sheath  
in the place where thou wast 
created  in the land of thine 
origin   
will i judge thee   
36and i will pour out my 
indignation upon thee   
i will blow upon thee with the fire 
of my wrath   
and i will deliver thee into the hand 
of brutish men   
skilful to destroy   
37thou shalt be for fuel to the fire   
thy blood shall be i n the midst of 
the land   
thou shalt be no more remembered   
for i the lord have spoken it   
 
moreover the word of the 
lord came unto me  saying  
2now  thou son of man  wilt thou 
judge  wilt thou judge the bloody city  
then cause her to know all her 
abominations  3and thou shalt say  
thus saith the lord g od o city that 
sheddest blood in the midst of thee  
that thy time may come  and that 
makest idols unto thyself to defile 
thee 4thou art become guilty in thy 22 ezekiel  
791 
 blood that thou hast shed  and art 
defile d in thine idols which thou hast 
made  and thou hast caused thy days to 
draw near  and art come even unto thy 
years  therefore have i made thee a 
reproach unto the nations  and a 
mocking to all the countries  5those 
that are near  and those that are far 
from thee  shall mock thee  thou 
defiled of name and full of tumult   
6behold  the princes of israel  every 
one according to his might  have been 
in thee to shed blood  7in thee have 
they made light of father and mother  
in the midst of thee have they dealt by 
oppression with the stranger  in thee 
have they wronged the fatherless and 
the widow  8thou hast despised my 
holy things  and hast profaned my 
sabbaths  9in thee have been 
talebearers to shed blood  and in thee 
they have eaten upon the mountains  in 
the midst of thee they have committed 
lewdness  10in thee have they 
uncovered their fathers nakedness  in 
thee have they humbled her that was 
unclean in her impurity  11and each 
hath committed abomination with his 
neighbour s wife  and each hath 
lewdly defile d his daughter inlaw 
and each in thee hath humbled his 
sister  his father s daughter  12in thee 
have they taken gifts to shed blood  
thou hast taken interest and increase  
and thou hast greedily gained of thy 
neighbours by oppression  and hast 
forgotten me saith the lord g od  
13behold  therefore  i have smitten 
my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made  and at thy blood 
which hath been in the midst of thee  
14can thy heart endure  or can thy 
hands be strong  in the days that i shall 
deal with t hee i the lord have spoken 
it and will do it  15and i will scatter 
thee among the nations  and disperse 
thee through the countries  and i will 
consume thy filthiness out of thee  
16and thou shalt be profaned in 
thyself  in the sight of the nations  and 
thou shalt know that i am the lord  
17and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  18son of man  the 
house of israel is become dross unto 
me all of them are brass and tin and 
iron and lead  in the midst of the 
furnace  they are the dross of silver  
19therefore thus saith the lord g od 
because ye are all become dross  
therefore  behold  i will gather you 
into the midst of jerusalem  20as they 
gather silver and brass and iron and 
lead and tin into the midst of the 
furnace  to blow the fire upon it  to 
melt it so will i gather you in mine 
anger and in my fury  and i will cast 
you in  and melt you  21yea i will 
gather you  and blow upon you with 
the fire of my wrath  and ye shall be 
melted in the midst thereof  22as silver 
is melted in the midst of the fu rnace  
so shall ye be melted in the midst 
thereof  and ye shall know that i the 
lord have poured out my fury upon 
you  
23and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  24son of man  say 
unto her  thou art a land that is not ezekiel  
792 
 cleansed  nor rained upon in the day of 
indignation  25there is a conspiracy of 
her prophets in the midst thereof  like 
a roaring lion ravening the prey  they 
have devoured souls  they take 
treasure and precious things  they have 
made her widows many in the midst 
thereof  26her priest s have done 
violence to my law  and have profaned 
my holy things  they have put no 
difference between the holy and the 
common  neither have they taught 
difference between the unclean and the 
clean  and have hid their eyes from my 
sabbaths  and i am profane d among 
them  27her princes in the midst 
thereof are like wolves ravening the 
prey to shed blood  and to destroy 
souls  so as to get dishonest gain  
28and her prophets have daubed for 
them with whited plaster  seeing 
falsehood  and divining lies unto them  
saying  thus saith the lord g od when 
the lord hath not spoken  29the people 
of the land have used oppression  and 
exercised robbery  and have wronged 
the poor and needy  and have 
oppressed the stranger unlawfully  
30and i sought for a man among them  
that should make up the hedge  and 
stand in the breach before me for the 
land that i should not destroy it  but i 
found none  31therefore have i poured 
out mine indignation upon them  i 
have consumed them with the fire of 
my wrath  their own way have i 
brought upon their heads  saith the 
lord g od  
 and the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  there were two women  the 
daughters of one mother  3and they 
committed harlotries in egypt  they 
committed harlotries in their youth  
there were th eir bosoms pressed  and 
there their virgin breasts were bruised  
4and the names of them were oholah 
the elder  and oholibah her sister  and 
they became mine  and they bore sons 
and daughters  and as for their names  
samaria is aoholah  and jerusalem 
boholi bah  
5and oholah played the harlot when 
she was mine  and she doted on her 
lovers  on the assyrians  warriors  
6clothed with blue  governors and 
rulers  handsome young men all of 
them  horsemen riding upon horses  
7and she bestowed her harlotries upon 
them the choicest men of assyria all 
of them  and on whomsoever she 
doted  with all their idols she defiled 
herself  8neither hath she left her 
harlotries brought from egypt  for in 
her youth they lay with her  and they 
bruised her virgin breasts  and they 
poured out their lust upon her  
9wherefore i delivered her into the 
hand of her lovers  into the hand of the 
assyrians  upon whom she doted  
10these uncovered her nakedness  they 
took her sons and her daughters  and 
her they slew with the sword  and she 
                                                      
a that is her tent  
b that is my tent  is in her  23 ezekiel  
793 
 became a byword among women  for 
judgments were executed upon her   
11and her sister oholibah saw this  
yet was she more corrupt in her doting 
than she  and in her harlotries more 
than her sister in her harlotries  12she 
doted upon the assyrians  governors 
and rulers  warriors  clothed most 
gorgeously  horsemen riding upon 
horses  all of them handsome young 
men 13and i saw that she was defiled  
they both took one way  14and she 
increased her harlotries  for she saw 
men portrayed upon the wall  the 
images of t he chaldeans portrayed 
with vermilion  15girded with girdles 
upon their loins  with pendant turbans 
upon their heads  all of them captains 
to look upon  the likeness of the sons 
of babylon  even of chaldea  the land 
of their nativity  16and as soon as she 
saw them she doted upon them  and 
sent messengers unto them into 
chaldea  17and the babylonians came 
to her into the bed of love  and they 
defiled her with their lust  and she was 
polluted with them  and her soul was 
alienated from them  18so she 
uncovered  her harlotries  and 
uncovered her nakedness  then my 
soul was alienated from her  like as 
my soul was alienated from her sister  
19yet she multiplied her harlotries  
remembering the days of her youth  
wherein she had played the harlot in 
the land of egypt  20and she doted 
upon concubinage with them  whose 
flesh is as the flesh of asses  and 
whose issue is like the issue of horses  21thus thou didst call to remembrance 
the lewdness of thy youth  when they 
from egypt bruised thy breasts for the 
bosom of thy youth   
22therefore  o oholibah  thus saith 
the lord g od behold  i will raise up 
thy lovers against thee  from whom thy 
soul is alienated  and i will bring them 
against thee on every side  23the 
babylonians and all the chaldeans  
pekod and shoa and koa  and all the 
assyrians with them  handsome young 
men governors and rulers all of them  
captains and councillors  all of them 
riding upon horses  24and they shall 
come against thee with hosts  chariots  
and wheels  and with an assembly of 
peoples  they shall  set themselves in 
array against thee with buckler and 
shield and helmet round about  and i 
will commit the judgment unto them  
and they shall judge thee according to 
their judgments  25and i will set my 
jealousy against thee  and they shall 
deal with thee  in fury  they shall take 
away thy nose and thine ears  and thy 
residue shall fall by the sword  they 
shall take thy sons and thy daughters  
and thy residue shall be devoured by 
the fire  26they shall also strip thee of 
thy clothes  and take away thy fair 
jewels  27thus will i make thy 
lewdness to cease from thee  and thy 
harlotry brought from the land of 
egypt  so that thou shalt not lift up 
thine eyes unto them  nor remember 
egypt any more   
28for thus saith the lord g od 
behold  i will deliver thee into the ezekiel  
794 
 hand of them whom thou hatest  into 
the hand of them from whom thy soul 
is alienated  29and they shall deal with 
thee in hatred  and shall take away all 
thy labour  and shall leave thee naked 
and bare  and the nakedness of thy 
harlotries shall be uncov ered both thy 
lewdness and thy harlotries  30these 
things shall be done unto thee  for that 
thou hast gone astray after the nations  
and because thou art polluted with 
their idols  31in the way of thy sister 
hast thou walked  therefore will i give 
her cup  into thy hand  32thus saith the 
lord g od  
thou shalt drink of thy sister s cup   
which is deep and large   
thou shalt be for a scorn and a 
derision   
it is full to the uttermost   
33thou shalt be filled with 
drunkenness and sorrow   
with the cup of aston ishment and 
appalment   
with the cup of thy sister samaria   
34thou shalt even drink it and drain 
it  
and thou shalt craunch the sherds 
thereof   
and shalt tear thy breasts   
for i have spoken it   
saith the lord g od  
35therefore thus saith the lord g od 
because thou hast forgotten me  and 
cast me behind thy back  therefore 
bear thou also thy lewdness and thy 
harlotries   
36the lord said moreover unto me  
son of man  wilt thou judge oholah and oholibah  then declare unto them 
their abominations  37for t hey have 
committed adultery  and blood is in 
their hands  and with their idols have 
they committed adultery  and their 
sons whom they bore unto me  they 
have also set apart unto them to be 
devoured  38moreover this they have 
done unto me  they have defile d my 
sanctuary in the same day  and have 
profaned my sabbaths  39for when 
they had slain their children to their 
idols  then they came the same day 
into my sanctuary to profane it  and 
lo thus have they done in the midst of 
my house  40and furthermore ye  have 
sent for men that come from far  unto 
whom a messenger was sent  and lo 
they came  for whom thou didst wash 
thyself  paint thine eyes  and deck 
thyself with ornaments  41and sattest 
upon a stately bed  with a table 
prepared before it  whereupon tho u 
didst set mine incense and mine oil  
42and the voice of a multitude being at 
ease was therein  and for the sake of 
men they were so many  brought 
drunken from the wilderness  they put 
bracelets upon their hands  and 
beautiful crowns upon their heads  
43then said i of her that was worn out 
by adulteries  still they commit 
harlotries with her  even her  44for 
every one went in unto her  as men go 
in unto a harlot  so went they in unto 
oholah and unto oholibah  the lewd 
women  45but righteous men  they 
shall judge them as adulteresses are 
judged  and as women that shed blood ezekiel  
795 
 are judged  because they are 
adulteresses  and blood is in their 
hands   
46for thus saith the lord g od an 
assembly shall be brought up against 
them  and they shall be made a horror 
and a spoil  47and the assembly shall 
stone them with stones  and despatch 
them with their swords  they shall slay 
their sons and their daughters  and 
burn up their houses with fire  48thus 
will i cause lewdness to cease out of 
the land  that all women may be taught 
not to do after your lewdness  49and 
your lewdness shall be recompensed 
upon you  and ye shall bear the sins of 
your idols  and ye shall know that i am 
the lord g od  
and the word of the lord 
came unto me in the ninth 
year in the tenth month  in the tenth 
day of the month  saying  2son of 
man write thee the name of the day  
even of this selfsame day  this 
selfsame day the king of babylon hath 
invested jerusalem  3and utter a 
parable concerning the rebellious 
house  and say unto them  thus sait h 
the lord g od  
set on the pot  set it on   
and also pour water into it   
4gather into it the pieces belonging 
to it  
even every good piece  the thigh  
and the shoulder   
fill it with the choice bones   
5take the choice of the flock   
and pile also the b ones under it   
make it boil well   that the bones thereof may also be 
seethed in the midst of it   
6wherefore thus saith the lord g od 
woe to the bloody city  to the pot 
whose filth is therein  and whose filth 
is not gone out of it  bring it out piece 
by piece  no lot is fallen upon it  7for 
her blood is in the midst of her  she set 
it upon the bare rock  she poured it not 
upon the ground  to cover it with dust  
8that it might cause fury to come up  
that vengeance might be taken  i have 
set her blood upon the bare rock  that it 
should not be covered  9therefore thus 
saith the lord g od woe to the bloody 
city i also will make the pile great  
10heaping on the wood  kindling the 
fire that the flesh may be consumed  
and preparing the mixture  that the 
bones a lso may be burned  11then will i 
set it empty upon the coals thereof  
that it may be hot  and the bottom 
thereof may burn  and that the 
impurity of it may be molten in it  that 
the filth of it may be consumed12it 
hath wearied itself with toil  yet its 
great filth goeth not forth out of it  yea 
its noisome filth  13because of thy 
filthy lewdness  because i have purged 
thee and thou wast not purged  thou 
shalt not be purged from thy filthiness 
any more  till i have satisfied my fury 
upon thee  14i the lord have spoken it  
it shall come to pass  and i will do it  i 
will not go back  neither will i spare  
neither will i repent  according to thy 
ways  and according to thy doings  
shall they judge thee  saith the lord 
god  24 ezekiel  
796 
 15also the word of the lord came 
unto me saying  16son of man  
behold  i take away from thee the 
desire of thine eyes with a stroke  yet 
neither shalt thou make lamentation 
nor weep  neither shall thy tears run 
down  17sigh in silence  make no 
mourning for the dead  bind thy 
headtire upon th ee and put thy shoes 
upon thy feet  and cover not thine 
upper lip  and eat not the bread of 
men 18so i spoke unto the people in 
the morning  and at even my wife 
died and i did in the morning as i was 
commanded  19and the people said 
unto me  wilt thou  not tell us what 
these things are to us  that thou doest 
so 20then i said unto them  the 
word of the lord came unto me  
saying  21speak unto the house of 
israel  thus saith the lord g od 
behold  i will profane my sanctuary  
the pride of your power  the desire of 
your eyes  and the longing of your 
soul and your sons and your daughters 
whom ye have left behind shall fall by 
the sword  22and ye shall do as i have 
done  ye shall not cover your upper 
lips nor eat the bread of men  23and 
your tires shall be  upon your heads  
and your shoes upon your feet  ye shall 
not make lamentation nor weep  but ye 
shall pine away in your iniquities  and 
moan one toward another  24thus shall 
ezekiel be unto you a sign  according 
to all that he hath done shall ye do  
when t his cometh  then shall ye know 
that i am the lord g od  25and thou  son of man  shall it not 
be in the day when i take from them 
their stronghold  the joy of their glory  
the desire of their eyes  and the 
yearning of their soul  their sons and 
their daught ers 26that in that day he 
that escapeth shall come unto thee  to 
cause thee to hear it with thine ears  
27in that day shall thy mouth be 
opened together with him that is 
escaped  and thou shalt speak  and be 
no more dumb  so shalt thou be a sign 
unto them  and they shall know that i 
am the lord  
 
and the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  set thy face toward the 
children of ammon  and prophesy 
against them  3and say unto the 
children of ammon  hear the word of 
the lord g od thus sait h the lord 
god because thou saidst  aha against 
my sanctuary  when it was profaned  
and against the land of israel  when it 
was made desolate  and against the 
house of judah  when they went into 
captivity  4therefore  behold  i will 
deliver thee to the c hildren of the east 
for a possession  and they shall set 
their encampments in thee  and make 
their dwellings in thee  they shall eat 
thy fruit  and they shall drink thy milk  
5and i will make rabbah a pasture for 
camels  and the children of ammon a 
couchin gplace for flocks  and ye shall 
know that i am the lord 6for thus 
saith the lord g od because thou hast 
clapped thy hands  and stamped with 25 ezekiel  
797 
 the feet  and rejoiced with all the 
disdain of thy soul against the land of 
israel  7therefore  behold  i stretch out 
my hand upon thee  and will deliver 
thee for a spoil to the nations  and i 
will cut thee off from the peoples  and 
i will cause thee to perish out of the 
countries  i will destroy thee  and thou 
shalt know that i am the lord  
8thus saith the lord g od because 
that moab and seir do say  behold  the 
house of judah is like unto all the 
nations  9therefore  behold  i will open 
the flank of moab on the side of the 
cities  on the side of his cities which 
are on his frontiers  the beauteous 
country of beth jeshimoth  baalmeon  
and kiriathaim  10together with the 
children of ammon  unto the children 
of the east  and i will give them for a 
possession  that the children of 
ammon may not be remembered 
among the nations  11and i will execute 
judgments upon moab  and they shall 
know that i am the lord  
12thus saith the lord g od because 
that edom hath dealt against the house 
of judah by taking vengeance  and 
hath greatly offended  and revenged 
himself upon them  13therefore thus 
saith the lord g od i will stretch o ut 
my hand upon edom  and will cut off 
man and beast from it  and i will make 
it desolate from teman  even unto 
dedan shall they fall by the sword  
14and i will lay my vengeance upon 
edom by the hand of my people israel  
and they shall do in edom according  to 
mine anger and according to my fury  and they shall know my vengeance  
saith the lord g od  
15thus saith the lord g od because 
the philistines have dealt by revenge  
and have taken vengeance with disdain 
of soul to destroy  for the old hatred  
16theref ore thus saith the lord g od 
behold  i will stretch out my hand 
upon the philistines  and i will cut off 
the cherethites  and destroy the 
remnant of the sea coast  17and i will 
execute great vengeance upon them 
with furious rebukes  and they shall 
know tha t i am the lord when i shall 
lay my vengeance upon them   
and it came to pass in the 
eleventh year  in the first day 
of the month  that the word of the 
lord came unto me  saying  2son of 
man because that tyre hath said 
against jerusalem   
aha she is broken that was the gate 
of the peoples   
she is turned unto me

wherein is made a breach   
11with the hoofs of his horses  
shall he tread down all thy streets   he shall slay thy people with the 
sword   
and the pillars of thy strength

and lay away their robes  and strip off 
their richly woven garments  they shall 
clothe themselves with trembling  they 
shall sit upon the ground  and shall 
tremble every moment  and be 
appalled at thee   ezekiel  
799 
 17and they shall take up a 
lamentation for thee  and say to thee   
how art thou destroyed  that wast 
peopled from the seas   
the renowned city   
that wast strong in the sea   
thou and thy inhabitants   
that caused your terror to be  
on all that inhabit the earth   
18now shall the isles tremble  
in the day of thy fall   
yea the isles that are in the sea  
shall be affrighted at thy going out   
19for thus saith the lord g od when i 
shall make thee a desolate city  like the 
cities that a re not inhabited  when i 
shall bring up the deep upon thee  and 
the great waters shall cover thee  
20then will i bring thee down with 
them that descend into the pit  to the 
people of old time  and will make thee 
to dwell in the nether parts of the 
earth  like the places that are desolate 
of old  with them that go down to the 
pit that thou be not inhabited  and i 
will set glory in the land of the living  
21i will make thee a terror  and thou

thus saith the lord g od  
because thy heart is lifted up   
and thou hast said  i am a god   
i sit in the seat of god   
in the heart of the seas   
yet thou art man  and not god   
though thou didst set thy heart as 
the heart of god   
3behold  thou art wiser than daniel   
there is no secret that they can hide 
from thee   
4by thy wisdom and by thy 
discernment  
thou hast gotten thee riches   
and hast gotten gold and silver  
into thy treasures   
5in thy great wisdom by thy traffic  
hast thou increased thy riches   
and thy heart is lifted up because of 
thy ric hes  
6therefore thus saith the lord g od  
because thou hast set thy heart  
as the heart of god   
7therefore  behold  i will bring 
strangers upon thee   
the terrible of the nations   
and they shall draw their swords 
against the beauty of thy wisdom   
and they shall defile thy brightness   28 ezekiel  
802 
 8they shall bring thee down to the 
pit  
and thou shalt die the deaths of 
them that are slain   
in the heart of the seas   
9wilt thou yet say before him that 
slayeth thee   
i am god   
but thou art man  and not god   
in the  hand of them that defile thee   
10thou shalt die the deaths of the 
uncircumcised

for i have spoken  saith the lord 
god  
11moreover the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  12son of man  take

sapphire  the carbuncle  and the 
smaragd  and gold  the workmanship 
of thy settings and of thy sockets was 
in thee  in the day that thou wast

wast the far covering cherub  and i set 
thee so that thou  wast upon the holy 
mountain of god  thou hast walked up 
and down in the midst of stones of fire  
15thou wast perfect in thy ways from 
the day that thou wast created  till 
unrighteousness was found in thee  
16by the multitude of thy traffic they 
filled the  midst of thee with violence  and thou hast sinned  therefore have i 
cast thee as profane out of the 
mountain of god  and i have destroyed 
thee o covering cherub  from the 
midst of the stones of fire  17thy heart 
was lifted up because of thy beauty  
thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by 
reason of thy brightness  i have cast 
thee to the ground  i have laid thee 
before kings  that they may gaze upon 
thee 18by the multitude of thine 
iniquities  in the unrighteousness of 
thy traffic  thou hast profaned thy 
sanctu aries  therefore have i brought 
forth a fire from the midst of thee  it 
hath devoured thee  and i have turned 
thee to ashes upon the earth in the 
sight of all them that behold thee  19all 
they that know thee among the peoples

be any more   
20and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  21son of man  set thy 
face toward zidon  and prophesy 
against it  22and say  thus saith the 
lord g od  
behold  i am against thee  o zidon   
and i w ill be glorified in the midst 
of thee   
and they shall know that i am the 
lord when i shall have executed 
judgments in her  and shall be 
sanctified in her   
23for i will send into her pestilence  
and blood in her streets   
and the wounded shall fall in th e 
midst of her  ezekiel

 by the sword upon her on every 
side and they shall know that i am the 
lord 24and there shall be no more a 
pricking brier unto the house of israel  
nor a piercing thorn of any that are 
round about them  that did have them 
in disdain  and t hey shall know that i 
am the lord g od  
25thus saith the lord g od when i 
shall have gathered the house of israel 
from the peoples among whom they 
are scattered  and shall be sanctified in 
them in the sight of the nations  then 
shall they dwell in their ow n land 
which i gave to my servant jacob  
26and they shall dwell safely therein  
and shall build houses  and plant 
vineyards  yea they shall dwell safely  
when i have executed judgments upon 
all those that have them in disdain 
round about them  and they sh all know 
that i am the lord their god   
in the tenth year  in the tenth 
month  in the twelfth day of 
the month  the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  2son of man  set thy 
face against pharaoh king of egypt  
and prophesy against him  and against 
all egypt  3speak  and say  thus saith 
the lord g od  
behold  i am against thee  pharaoh  
king of egypt   
the great dragon that lieth  
in the midst of his rivers   
that hath said  my river is mine 
own  
and i have made it for myself   
4and i will put hooks in thy jaws  
and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales  and i will bring 
thee up out of the midst of thy rivers  
and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick 
unto thy scales  5and i will cast thee 
into the wilderness   
thee and all the  fish of thy rivers   
thou shalt fall upon the open field   
thou shalt not be brought together  
nor gathered   
to the beasts of the earth and to the 
fowls of the heaven  
have i given thee for food   
6and all the inhabitants of egypt 
shall know  
that i am t he lord  
because they have been a staff of 
reed  
to the house of israel   
7when they take hold of thee with 
the hand  thou dost break   
and rend all their shoulders   
and when they lean upon thee  thou 
breakest   
and makest all their loins to be at a 
stand  
8therefore thus saith the lord g od 
behold  i will bring a sword upon thee  
and will cut off from thee man and 
beast  9and the land of egypt shall be 
desolate and waste  and they shall 
know that i am the lord because he 
hath said  the river is mine  and i have 
made it  10therefore  behold  i am 
against thee  and against thy rivers  
and i will make the land of egypt 
utterly waste and desolate  from 
migdol to syene even unto the border 
of ethiopia  11no foot of man shall 
pass through it  nor foot of beas t shall 29 ezekiel  
804 
 pass through it  neither shall it be 
inhabited forty years  12and i will 
make the land of egypt desolate in the 
midst of the countries that are desolate  
and her cities among the cities that are 
laid waste shall be desolate forty 
years  and i will scatter the egyptians 
among the nations  and will disperse 
them through the countries   
13for thus saith the lord g od at the 
end of forty years will i gather the 
egyptians from the peoples whither 
they were scattered  14and i will turn 
the captivity of eg ypt and will cause 
them to return into the land of pathros  
into the land of their origin  and they 
shall be there a lowly kingdom  15it 
shall be the lowliest of the kingdoms  
neither shall it any more lift itself up 
above the nations  and i will diminish  
them  that they shall no more rule over 
the nations  16and it shall be no more 
the confidence of the house of israel  
bringing iniquity to remembrance  
when they turn after them  and they 
shall know that i am the lord g od  
17and it came to pass in the s even 
and twentieth year  in the first month  
in the first day of the month  the word 
of the lord came unto me  saying  
18son of man  nebuchadrezzar king of 
babylon caused his army to serve a 
great service against tyre  every head 
was made bald  and every shoulder 
was peeled  yet had he no wages  nor 
his army  from tyre  for the service 
that he had served against it  
19therefore thus saith the lord g od 
behold  i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  
and he shall carry off her abu ndance  
and take her spoil  and take her prey  
and it shall be the wages for his army  
20i have given him the land of egypt as 
his hire for which he served  because 
they wrought for me  saith the lord 
god  
21in that day will i cause a horn to 
shoot up unt o the house of israel  and i 
will give thee the opening of the 
mouth in the midst of them  and they 
shall know that i am the lord  
and the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  prophesy  and say  thus saith 
the lord g od  
wail ye  woe w orth the day   
3for the day is near   
even the day of the lord is near   
a day of clouds  it shall be the time 
of the nations   
4and a sword shall come upon 
egypt   
and convulsion shall be in ethiopia   
when the slain shall fall in egypt   
and they shall t ake away her 
abundance   
and her foundation shall be broken 
down   
5ethiopia  and put  and lud  and all the 
mingled people  and cub  and the 
children of the land that is in league  
shall fall with them by the sword   
6thus saith the lord  
they also that u phold egypt shall 
fall  
and the pride of her power shall 
come down   30 ezekiel  
805 
 from migdol to syene shall they 
fall in it by the sword   
saith the lord g od  
7and they shall be desolate in the 
midst of the countries that are 
desolate   
and her cities shall be in th e midst 
of the cities that are wasted   
8and they shall know that i am the 
lord  
when i have set a fire in egypt   
and all her helpers are destroyed   
9in that day shall messengers go 
forth from before me in ships  
to make the confident ethiopians 
afraid   
and there shall come convulsion 
upon them in the day of egypt   
for lo it cometh   
 
10thus saith the lord g od  
i will also make the multitude of 
egypt to cease   
by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king 
of babylon   
11he and his people with him  the 
terribl e of the nations   
shall be brought in to destroy the 
land  
and they shall draw their swords 
against egypt   
and fill the land with the slain   
12and i will make the rivers dry   
and will give the land over into the 
hand of evil men   
and i will make the land desolate   
and all that is therein  by the hand 
of strangers   
i the lord have spoken it    
13thus saith the lord g od  
i will also destroy the idols   
and i will cause the things of 
nought to cease from noph   
and there shall be no more a prince 
out of the land of egypt   
and i will put a fear in the land of 
egypt   
14and i will make pathros desolate   
and will set a fire in zoan   
and will execute judgments in no   
15and i will pour my fury upon sin  
the stronghold of egypt   
and i will cut off the m ultitude of

16and i will set a fire in egypt   
sin shall be in great convulsion   
and no shall be rent asunder   
and in noph shall come adversaries

18at tehaphnehes also the day shall 
withdraw itself   
when i shall break there the yokes 
of egypt   
and the pride of her power shall 
cease in her   
as for her  a cloud shall cover her   
and her daughters shall go into 
captivity   
19thus will i execute judgments in 
egypt   
and they shall know that i am the 
lord  
 ezekiel  
806 
 20and it came to pass in the eleventh 
year in the first month  in the seventh 
day of the month  that the word of the 
lord came unto me  saying  21son of 
man i have brok en the arm of pharaoh 
king of egypt  and lo it hath not been 
bound up to be healed  to put a roller  
that it be bound up and wax strong  
that it hold the sword  22therefore thus 
saith the lord g od behold  i am 
against pharaoh king of egypt  and 
will bre ak his arms  the strong  and 
that which was broken  and i will 
cause the sword to fall out of his hand  
23and i will scatter the egyptians 
among the nations  and will disperse 
them through the countries  24and i 
will strengthen the arms of the king of 
baby lon and put my sword in his 
hand  but i will break the arms of 
pharaoh  and he shall groan before him 
with the groanings of a deadly 
wounded man  25and i will hold up the 
arms of the king of babylon  and the 
arms of pharaoh shall fall down  and 
they shall  know that i am the lord 
when i shall put my sword into the 
hand of the king of babylon  and he 
shall stretch it out upon the land of 
egypt  26and i will scatter the 
egyptians among the nations  and 
disperse them through the countries  
and they shall know  that i am the 
lord  
and it came to pass in the 
eleventh year  in the third 
month  in the first day of the month  
that the word of the lord came unto 
me saying  2son of man  say unto pharaoh king of egypt  and to his 
multitude   
whom art thou like i n thy 
greatness   
3behold  the assyrian was a cedar in 
lebanon   
with fair branches  and with a 
shadowing shroud   
and of a high stature   
and its top was among the thick 
boughs   
4the waters nourished it   
the deep made it to grow   
her rivers ran round  
about her plantation   
and she sent out her conduits  
unto all the trees of the field   
5therefore its stature was exalted  
above all the trees of the field   
and its boughs were multiplied   
and its branches became long   
because of the multitude of water s 
when it shot them forth   
6all the fowls of heaven made  
their nests in its boughs   
and all the beasts of the field did 
bring forth their young  
under its branches   
and under its shadow dwelt  
all great nations   
7thus was it fair in its greatness   
in the length of its branches   
for its root was  
by many waters   
8the cedars in the garden of god  
could not hide it   
the cypress trees were not  
like its boughs   
and the plane trees were not  31 ezekiel  
807 
 as its branches   
nor was any tree in the garden of 
god  
like unto it in its beauty   
9i made it fair  
by the multitude of its branches   
so that all the trees of eden   
that were in the garden of god  
envied it   
10therefore thus saith the lord g od 
because thou art exalted in stature  and 
he hath set his top amon g the thick 
boughs  and his heart is lifted up in his 
height  11i do even deliver him into the 
hand of the mighty one of the nations  
he shall surely deal with him  i do 
drive him out according to his 
wickedness  12and strangers  the 
terrible of the nation s do cut him off  
and cast him down  upon the 
mountains and in all the valleys his 
branches are fallen  and his boughs lie 
broken in all the channels of the land  
and all the peoples of the earth do go 
down from his shadow  and do leave 
him 13upon his ca rcass all the fowls 
of the heaven do dwell  and upon his 
branches are all the beasts of the field  
14to the end that none of all the trees 
by the waters exalt themselves in their 
stature  neither set their top among the 
thick boughs  nor that their mighty 
ones stand up in their height  even all 
that drink water  for they are all 
delivered unto death  to the nether 
parts of the earth  in the midst of the 
children of men  with them that go 
down to the pit   15thus saith the lord g od in the 
day when he went d own to the nether 
world i caused the deep to mourn and 
cover itself for him  and i restrained 
the rivers thereof  and the great waters 
were stayed  and i caused lebanon to 
mourn for him  and all the trees of the 
field fainted for him  16i made the 
nations to shake at the sound of his 
fall when i cast him down to the 
nether world with them that descend 
into the pit  and all the trees of eden  
the choice and best of lebanon  all 
that drink water  were comforted in the 
nether parts of the earth  17they also 
went down into the nether world with 
him unto them that are slain by the 
sword  yea they that were in his arm  
that dwelt under his shadow in the 
midst of the nations   
18to whom art thou thus like in 
glory and in greatness among the trees 
of eden  yet sha ll thou be brought 
down with the trees of eden unto the 
nether parts of the earth  thou shalt lie 
in the midst of the uncircumcised  with 
them that are slain by the sword  this 
is pharaoh and all his multitude  saith 
the lord g od  
and it came to pass in the 
twelfth year  in the twelfth 
month  in the first day of the month  
that the word of the lord came unto 
me saying  2son of man  take up a 
lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt  
and say unto him   
thou didst liken thyself unto a 
young lion of the na tions   32 ezekiel  
808 
 whereas thou art as a dragon in the 
seas  
and thou didst gush forth with thy 
rivers   
and didst trouble the waters with 
thy feet   
and foul their rivers   
3thus saith the lord g od  
i will therefore spread out my net 
over thee  
with a company of m any peoples   
and they shall bring thee up in my 
net  
4and i will cast thee upon the land   
i will hurl thee upon the open field   
and will cause all the fowls of the 
heaven to settle upon thee   
and i will fill the beasts of the 
whole earth with thee   
5and i will lay thy flesh upon the 
mountains   
and fill the valleys with thy 
foulness   
6i will also water with thy blood the 
land wherein thou swimmest  
even to the mountains   
and the channels shall be full of 
thee  
7and when i shall extinguish thee  i 
will cover the heaven   
and make the stars thereof black   
i will cover the sun with a cloud   
and the moon shall not give her 
light  
8all the bright lights of heaven  
will i make black over thee   
and set darkness upon thy land   
saith the lord g od  9i will also vex the hearts of many 
peoples  when i shall bring thy 
destruction among the nations  into the 
countries which thou hast not known  
10yea i will make many peoples 
appalled at thee  and their kings shall 
be horribly afraid for thee  when i 
shall b randish my sword before them  
and they shall tremble at every 
moment  every man for his own life  in 
the day of thy fall   
11for thus saith the lord g od the 
sword of the king of babylon shall 
come upon thee  12by the swords of 
the mighty will i cause thy multitude 
to fall   
the terrible of the nations are they 
all  
and they shall spoil the pride of 
egypt   
and all the multitude thereof shall 
be destroyed   
13i will destroy also all the beasts 
thereof  
from beside many waters   
neither shall the foot of ma n trouble 
them any more   
nor the hoofs of beasts trouble 
them   
14then will i make their waters to 
settle   
and cause their rivers to run like oil   
saith the lord g od  
15when i shall make the land of 
egypt desolate and waste   
a land destitute of that w hereof it 
was full   
when i shall smite all them that 
dwell therein   ezekiel  
809 
 then shall they know that i am the 
lord  
16this is the lamentation wherewith 
they shall lament   
the daughters of the nations shall 
lament therewith   
for egypt  and for all her multitu de 
shall they lament therewith   
saith the lord g od  
 
17it came to pass also in the twelfth 
year in the fifteenth day of the month  
that the word of the lord came unto 
me saying  18son of man  wail for the 
multitude of egypt  and cast them 
down  even  her with the daughters of 
the mighty nations  unto the nether 
parts of the earth  with them that go 
down into the pit   
19whom dost thou pass in beauty   
go down  and be thou laid with the 
   uncircumcised   
20they shall fall in the midst of them 
that ar e slain by the sword  she is 
delivered to the sword  draw her down 
and all her multitudes  21the strong 
among the mighty shall speak of him 
out of the midst of the nether world 
with them that helped him  they are 
gone down  they lie still  even the 
uncircu mcised  slain by the sword  
22asshur is there and all her company  
their graves are round about them  all 
of them slain  fallen by the sword  
23whose graves are set in the uttermost 
parts of the pit  and her company is 
round about her grave  all of them 
slain fallen by the sword  who caused 
terror in the land of the living  24there is elam and all her multitude round 
about her grave  all of them slain  
fallen by the sword  who are gone 
down uncircumcised into the nether 
parts of the earth  who caused their  
terror in the land of the living  yet 
have they borne their shame with them 
that go down to the pit  25they have 
set her a bed in the midst of the slain 
with all her multitude  her graves are 
round about them  all of them 
uncircumcised  slain by the sword  
because their terror was caused in the 
land of the living  yet have they borne 
their shame with them that go down to 
the pit  they are put in the midst of 
them that are slain  26there is 
meshech  tubal  and all her multitude  
her graves are round about t hem all of 
them uncircumcised  slain by the 
sword  because they caused their terror 
in the land of the living  27and they 
that are inferior to the uncircumcised 
shall not lie with the mighty that are 
gone down to the nether world with 
their weapons of war  whose swords 
are laid under their heads  and whose 
iniquities are upon their bones  
because the terror of the mighty was in 
the land of the living  28but thou  in the 
midst of the uncircumcised shalt thou 
be broken and lie  even with them that 
are slain by the sword  29there is 
edom  her kings and all her princes  
who for all their might are laid with 
them that are slain by the sword  they 
shall lie with the uncircumcised  and 
with them that go down to the pit  
30there are the princes of the north  all ezekiel  
810 
 of them  and all the zidonians  who are 
gone down with the slain  ashamed for 
all the terror which they caused by 
their might  and they lie uncircumcised 
with them that are slain by the sword  
and bear their shame with them that go 
down to the pit  31these s hall pharaoh 
see and shall be comforted over all his 
multitude  even pharaoh and all his 
army  slain by the sword  saith the 
lord g od 32for i have put my terror 
in the land of the living  and he shall 
be laid in the midst of the 
uncircumcised  with them that are 
slain by the sword  even pharaoh and 
all his multitude  saith the lord g od  
 
and the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  speak to the children of thy 
people  and say unto them  when i 
bring the sword upon a land  if the 
peopl e of the land take a man from 
among them  and set him for their 
watchman  3if when he seeth the 
sword come upon the land  he blow 
the horn  and warn the people  4then 
whosoever heareth the sound of the 
horn and taketh not warning  if the 
sword come  and take him away  his 
blood shall be upon his own head  5he 
heard the sound of the horn  and took 
not warning  his blood shall be upon 
him whereas if he had taken warning  
he would have delivered his soul  6but 
if the watchman see the sword come  
and blow no t the horn  and the people 
be not warned  and the sword do come  
and take any person from among them  he is taken away in his iniquity  but his 
blood will i require at the watchman s 
hand   
7so thou  son of man  i have set thee 
a watchman unto the house of  israel  
therefore  when thou shalt hear the 
word at my mouth  warn them from 
me 8when i say unto the wicked  o 
wicked man  thou shalt surely die  and 
thou dost not speak to warn the wicked 
from his way  that wicked man shall 
die in his iniquity  but his blood will i 
require at thy hand  9nevertheless  if 
thou warn the wicked of his way to 
turn from it  and he turn not from his 
way he shall die in his iniquity  but 
thou hast delivered thy soul   
10therefore  o thou son of man  say 
unto the house of israel  thus ye 
speak  saying  our transgressions and 
our sins are upon us  and we pine away 
in them  how then can we live  11say 
unto them  as i live  saith the lord 
god i have no pleasure in the death of 
the wicked  but that the wicked turn 
from his way and l ive turn ye  turn ye 
from your evil ways  for why will ye 
die o house of israel   
12and thou  son of man  say unto the 
children of thy people  the 
righteousness of the righteous shall not 
deliver him in the day of his 
transgression  and as for the 
wicked ness of the wicked  he shall not 
stumble thereby in the day that he 
turneth from his wickedness  neither 
shall he that is righteous be able to live 
thereby in the day that he sinneth  
13when i say to the righteous  that he 33 ezekiel  
811 
 shall surely live  if he trust to  his 
righteousness  and commit iniquity  
none of his righteous deeds shall be 
remembered  but for his iniquity that 
he hath committed  for it shall he die  
14again  when i say unto the wicked  
thou shalt surely die  if he turn from 
his sin  and do that whi ch is lawful and 
right  15if the wicked restore the 
pledge  give back that which he had 
taken by robbery  walk in the statutes 
of life  committing no iniquity  he 
shall surely live  he shall not die  
16none of his sins that he hath 
committed shall be remem bered 
against him  he hath done that which is 
lawful and right  he shall surely live  
17yet the children of thy people say  
the way of the lord is not equal  but 
as for them  their way is not equal  
18when the righteous turneth from his 
righteousness  and committeth 
iniquity  he shall even die thereby  
19and when the wicked turneth from 
his wickedness  and doeth that which 
is lawful and right  he shall live 
thereby  20yet ye say  the way of the 
lord is not equal  o house of israel  i 
will judge you every on e after his 
ways   
21and it came to pass in the twelfth 
year of our captivity  in the tenth 
month  in the fifth day of the month  
that one that had escaped out of 
jerusalem came unto me  saying  the 
city is smitten  22now the hand of the 
lord had been u pon me in the 
evening  before he that was escaped 
came  and he had opened my mouth against his coming to me in the 
morning  and my mouth was opened  
and i was no more dumb  23then the 
word of the lord came unto me  
saying  24son of man  they that 
inhabit those waste places in the land 
of israel speak  saying  abraham was 
one and he inherited the land  but we 
are many  the land is given us for 
inheritance  25wherefore say unto 
them  thus saith the lord g od ye eat 
with the blood  and lift up your eyes 
unto your idols  and shed blood  and 
shall ye possess the land  26ye stand 
upon your sword  ye work 
abomination  and ye defile every one 
his neighbour s wife  and shall ye 
possess the land  27thus shalt thou say 
unto them  thus saith the lord g od 
as i live  surely they that are in the 
waste places shall fall by the sword  
and him that is in the open field will i 
give to the beasts to be devoured  and 
they that are in the strongholds and in 
the caves shall die of the pestilence  
28and i will make the land most 
desolate  and the pride of her power 
shall cease  and the mountains of 
israel shall be desolate  so that none 
shall pass through  29then shall they 
know that i am the lord when i have 
made the land most desolate  because 
of all their abominations which th ey 
have committed   
30and as for thee  son of man  the 
children of thy people that talk of thee 
by the walls and in the doors of the 
houses  and speak one to another  
every one to his brother  saying  ezekiel  
812 
 come  i pray you  and hear what is the 
word that cometh  forth from the lord 
31and come unto thee as the people 
cometh  and sit before thee as my 
people  and hear thy words  but do 
them not for with their mouth they 
show much love  but their heart goeth 
after their covetousness  32and lo thou 
art unto them a s a love song of one 
that hath a pleasant voice  and can play 
well on an instrument  so they hear thy 
words  but they do them not  33when 
this cometh to pass behold  it 
cometh then shall they know that a 
prophet hath been among them   
and the word of t he lord 
came unto me  saying  2son 
of man  prophesy against the 
shepherds of israel  prophesy  and say 
unto them  even to the shepherds  thus 
saith the lord g od woe unto the 
shepherds of israel that have fed 
themselves  should not the shepherds 
feed the sheep  3ye did eat the fat  and 
ye clothed you with the wool  ye killed 
the fatlings  but ye fed not the sheep  
4the weak have ye not strengthened  
neither have ye healed that which was 
sick neither have ye bound up that 
which was broken  neither have ye 
brought back that which was driven 
away  neither have ye sought that 
which was lost  but with force have ye 
ruled over them and with rigour  5so 
were they scattered  because there was 
no shepherd  and they became food to 
all the beasts of the field  and we re 
scattered  6my sheep wandered 
through all the mountains  and upon every high hill  yea upon all the face 
of the earth were my sheep scattered  
and there was none that did search or 
seek 7therefore  ye shepherds  hear 
the word of the lord 8as i live  saith 
the lord g od surely forasmuch as my 
sheep became a prey  and my sheep 
became food to all the beasts of the 
field because there was no shepherd  
neither did my shepherds search for 
my sheep  but the shepherds fed 
themselves  and fed not my sheep  
9therefore  ye shepherds  hear the word 
of the lord 10thus saith the lord 
god behold  i am against the 
shepherds  and i will require my sheep 
at their hand  and cause them to cease 
from feeding the sheep  neither shall 
the shepherds feed themselves any 
more and i will deliver my sheep 
from their mouth  that they may not be 
food for them   
11for thus saith the lord g od 
behold  here am i  and i will search 
for my sheep  and seek them out  12as 
a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the 
day that he is among his  sheep that are 
separated  so will i seek out my sheep  
and i will deliver them out of all 
places whither they have been 
scattered in the day of clouds and thick 
darkness  13and i will bring them out 
from the peoples  and gather them 
from the countries  and will bring them 
into their own land  and i will feed 
them upon the mountains of israel  by 
the streams  and in all the habitable 
places of the country  14i will feed 
them in a good pasture  and upon the 34 ezekiel  
813 
 high mountains of israel shall their 
fold be  there  shall they lie down in a 
good fold  and in a fat pasture shall 
they feed upon the mountains of israel  
15i will feed my sheep  and i will 
cause them to lie down  saith the lord 
god 16i will seek that which was lost  
and will bring back that which was 
driven away  and will bind up that 
which was broken  and will strengthen 
that which was sick  and the fat and 
the strong i will destroy  i will feed 
them in justice  17and as for you  o 
my flock  thus saith the lord g od 
behold  i judge between cattle and 
cattle even the rams and the he goats  
18seemeth it a small thing unto you to 
have fed upon the good pasture  but ye 
must tread down with your feet the 
residue of your pasture  and to have 
drunk of the settled waters  but ye 
must foul the residue with your f eet 
19and as for my sheep  they eat that 
which ye have trodden with your feet  
and they drink that which ye have 
fouled with your feet   
20therefore thus saith the lord g od 
unto them  behold  i even i  will 
judge between the fat cattle and the 
lean cattl e 21because ye thrust with 
side and with shoulder  and push all 
the weak with your horns  till ye have 
scattered them abroad  22therefore will 
i save my flock  and they shall no 
more be a prey  and i will judge 
between cattle and cattle  23and i will 
set up one shepherd over them  and he 
shall feed them  even my servant 
david  he shall feed them  and he shall be their shepherd  24and i the lord 
will be their god  and my servant 
david prince among them  i the lord 
have spoken  25and i will make with 
them a covenant of peace  and will 
cause evil beasts to cease out of the 
land and they shall dwell safely in the 
wilderness  and sleep in the woods  
26and i will make them and the places 
round about my hill a blessing  and i 
will cause the shower to come down in  
its season  there shall be showers of 
blessing  27and the tree of the field 
shall yield its fruit  and the earth shall 
yield her produce  and they shall be 
safe in their land  and they shall know 
that i am the lord when i have 
broken the bars of their yo ke and have 
delivered them out of the hand of those 
that made bondmen of them  28and 
they shall no more be a prey to the 
nations  neither shall the beast of the 
earth devour them  but they shall dwell 
safely  and none shall make them 
afraid  29and i will raise up unto them 
a plantation for renown  and they shall 
be no more consumed with hunger in 
the land  neither bear the shame of the 
nations any more  30and they shall 
know that i the lord their god am 
with them  and that they  the house of 
israel  are my  people  saith the lord 
god 31and ye my sheep  the sheep of 
my pasture  are men  and i am your 
god saith the lord g od  
 
moreover the word of the 
lord came unto me  saying  
2son of man  set thy face against 35 ezekiel  
814 
 mount seir  and prophesy against it  
3and say unto it  thus saith the lord 
god behold  i am against thee  o 
mount seir  and i will stretch out my 
hand against thee  and i will make thee 
most desolate  4i will lay thy cities 
waste  and thou shalt be desolate  and 
thou shalt know that i am the lord 
5because thou hast had a hatred of old  
and hast hurled the children of israel 
unto the power of the sword in the 
time of their calamity  in the time of 
the iniquity of the end  6therefore  as i 
live saith the lord g od i will prepare 
thee unto blood  and blood shall 
pursue thee  surely thou hast hated 
thine own blood  therefore blood shall 
pursue thee  7thus will i make mount 
seir most desolate  and cut off from it 
him that passeth through and him that 
returneth  8and i will fill his 
mountains with his slain  in thy hills 
and in thy valleys and in all thy 
streams shall they fall that are slain 
with the sword  9i will make thee 
perpetual desolations  and thy cities 
shall not return  and ye shall know that 
i am the lord 10because thou hast 
said these two  nations and these two 
countries shall be mine  and we will 
possess it  whereas the lord was there  
11therefore  as i live  saith the lord 
god i will do according to thine anger 
and according to thine envy  which 
thou hast used out of thy hatred against 
them and i will make myself known 
among them  when i shall judge thee  
12and thou shalt know that i the lord 
have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains 
of israel  saying  they are laid 
desolate  they are given us to devour  
13and ye have magnified yourselves 
against me with your mouth  and have 
multiplied your words against me  i 
have heard it  14thus saith the lord 
god when the whole earth rejoiceth  i 
will make thee desolate  15as thou 
didst rejoice over the inheritance o f the 
house of israel  because it was 
desolate  so will i do unto thee  thou 
shalt be desolate  o mount seir  and all 
edom  even all of it  and they shall 
know that i am the lord  
 
and thou  son of man  
prophesy unto the mountains 
of israel  and say  ye mountains of 
israel  hear the word of the lord 
2thus saith the lord g od because the 
enemy hath said against you  aha 
even the ancient high places are ours 
in possession  3therefore prophesy  and 
say thus saith the lord g od because  
even because they  have made you 
desolate  and swallowed you up on 
every side  that ye might be a 
possession unto the rest of the nations  
and ye are taken up in the lips of 
talkers  and the evil report of the 
people  4therefore  ye mountains of 
israel  hear the word of the  lord g od 
thus saith the lord g od to the 
mountains and to the hills  to the 
streams and to the valleys  to the 
desolate wastes and to the cities that 
are forsaken  which are become a prey 
and derision to the residue of the 36 ezekiel  
815 
 nations that are round about  5therefore 
thus saith the lord g od surely in the 
fire of my jealousy have i spoken 
against the residue of the nations  and 
against all edom  that have appointed 
my land unto themselves for a 
possession with the joy of all their 
heart  with disdain of soul  to cast it 
out for a prey  6therefore prophesy 
concerning the land of israel  and say 
unto the mountains and to the hills  to 
the streams and to the valleys  thus 
saith the lord g od behold  i have 
spoken in my jealousy and in my fury  
because ye have born e the shame of 
the nations  7therefore thus saith the 
lord g od i have lifted up my hand  
surely the nations that are round about 
you they shall bear their shame  8but 
ye o mountains of israel  ye shall 
shoot forth your branches  and yield 
your fruit to my people israel  for they 
are at hand to come  9for behold  i am 
for you  and i will turn unto you  and 
ye shall be tilled and sown  10and i will 
multiply men upon you  all the house 
of israel  even all of it  and the cities 
shall be inhabited  and the w aste 
places shall be builded  11and i will 
multiply upon you man and beast  and 
they shall increase and be fruitful  and 
i will cause you to be inhabited after 
your former estate  and will do better 
unto you than at your beginnings  and 
ye shall know that i am the lord 
12yea i will cause men to walk upon 
you even my people israel  and they 
shall possess thee  and thou shalt be 
their inheritance  and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of 
children  13thus saith the lord g od 
because they say unto y ou thou land 
art a devourer of men  and hast been a 
bereaver of thy nations  14therefore 
thou shalt devour men no more  
neither bereave thy nations any more  
saith the lord g od 15neither will i 
suffer the shame of the nations any 
more to be heard against  thee neither 
shalt thou bear the reproach of the 
peoples any more  neither shalt thou 
cause thy nations to stumble any more  
saith the lord g od  
16moreover the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  17son of man  
when the house of israel dwelt in thei r 
own land  they defiled it by their way 
and by their doings  their way before 
me was as the uncleanness of a 
woman in her impurity  18wherefore i 
poured out my fury upon them for the 
blood which they had shed upon the 
land and because they had defiled it  
with their idols  19and i scattered them 
among the nations  and they were 
dispersed through the countries  
according to their way and according 
to their doings i judged them  20and 
when they came unto the nations  
whither they came  they profaned my 
holy name  in that men said of them  
these are the people of the lord and 
are gone forth out of his land  21but i 
had pity for my holy name  which the 
house of israel had profaned among 
the nations  whither they came  
22therefore say unto the house of 
israel  thus saith the lord g od i do ezekiel  
816 
 not this for your sake  o house of 
israel  but for my holy name  which ye 
have profaned among the nations  
whither ye came  23and i will sanctify 
my great name  which hath been 
profaned among the nations  which ye 
have profane d in the midst of them  
and the nations shall know that i am 
the lord saith the lord g od when i 
shall be sanctified in you before their 
eyes 24for i will take you from among 
the nations  and gather you out of all 
the countries  and will bring you into 
your own land  25and i will sprinkle 
clean water upon you  and ye shall be 
clean  from all your uncleannesses  
and from all your idols  will i cleanse 
you 26a new heart also will i give 
you and a new spirit will i put within 
you and i will take away the stony 
heart out of your flesh  and i will give 
you a heart of flesh  27and i will put 
my spirit within you  and cause you to 
walk in my statutes  and ye shall keep 
mine ordinances  and do them  28and 
ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to 
your fathers  and ye shall be my 
people  and i will be your god  29and i 
will save you from all your 
uncleannesses  and i will call for the 
corn and will increase it  and lay no 
famine upon you  30and i will multiply 
the fruit of the tree  and the increase of 
the field  that ye may receive no more 
the reproach of famine among the 
nations  31then shall ye remember 
your evil ways  and your doings that 
were not good  and ye shall loathe 
yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations  
32not for y our sake do i this  saith the 
lord g od be it known unto you  be

a desolation in the sight of all that 
passed by  35and they shall say  this 
land that was desolate is become like 
the garden of eden  and the waste and

the hand of the lord was 
upon me  and the lord carried 
me out in a spirit  and set me down in 
the midst of the valley  and it was full 
of bones  2and he caused me to pass 
by them round about  and behold  
there were very many in the open 37 ezekiel

came together  bone to its bone  8and i 
beheld  and lo there were sinews 
upon them  and flesh came up  and

breathe  upon these slain  that they may 
live 10so i prophesied as he 
commanded me  and the breath came 
into them  and they lived  and stood up 
upon their feet  an exceeding great 
host 11then he said unto me  son of 
man these bones are the whole house 
of isra el behold  they say  our bones 
are dried up  and our hope is lost  we 
are clean cut off  12therefore 
prophesy  and say unto them  thus

shall they be divided into two 
kingdoms any more at all  23neither 
shall they defile themselves any more 
with their idols  nor with their

field neither cut down any out of the 
forests  for they shall make fires of the 
weapons  and they shall spoil those  that spoiled them  and rob those that 
robbed them  saith the lord g od  
11and it shall come to pass in that 
day that i will give unto gog a place

know that the house of israel went into 
captivity for their iniquity  because 
they broke faith with me  and i hid my

breach of faith which they have 
committed against me  when they 
shall dwell safely in their land  and none shall make them afraid  27when i 
have brought them back from the 
peoples  and gathered them out of their 
enemies lands  and am sanctified in 
them in the sight of many nations  
28and they shall know that i am the 
lord their god  in that i caused them 
to go into captivity among the nation s 
and have gathered them unto their own 
land and i will leave none of them any 
more there  29neither will i hide my 
face any more from them  for i have 
poured out my spirit upon the house of 
israel  saith the lord g od

toward the place that was left  one 
door toward the north  and another 
door toward the south  and the breadth 
of the place that was left was five 
cubits round about   
12and the building that was before 
the separate place at the side toward 
the west was seventy cubits broad  and 
the wall of the building was five cubits 
thick round about  and the length 
thereof ninety cubits   
13and he measured the house  a 
hundred cubits long  and the separate 
place  and the building  with the walls 
thereof  a hundred cubits long  14also 
the breadth of the face of the house 
and of the separate place toward  the 
east a hundred cubits  15and he 
measured the length of the building 
before the separate place which was at 
the back thereof  and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the 
other side  a hundred cubits   
now the temple  and the inner place  
and the porches of the court  16the 
jambs  and the narrow windows  and 
the galleries  that they three had round 
about  over against the jambs there 
was a veneering of wood round about  
and from the ground up to the 
windows  and the windows were 
covered  17to the space above the door  
even unto the inner house  and 
without  and on all the wall round 
about within and without  by measure  
18and it was made with cherubim and 
palm trees  and a palm tree was 
between cherub and cherub  and every 
cherub had two faces  19so that there 
was the face of a man toward the 
palm tree on the one side  and the face 
of a young lion toward the palm tree 
on the other side  thus was it made 
through all the house round about  
20from the ground unto above the door 
were cherubim and pal mtrees made  
and so on the wall of the temple  21as 
for the temple  the jambs were 
squared  and the face of the sanctuary 
had an appearance such as is the 
appearance   
22the altar  three cubits high  and 
the length thereof two cubits  was of 
wood  and so the corners thereof  the 
length thereof  and the walls thereof  
were also of wood  and he said unto 
me this is the table that is before the 
lord  
23and the temple and the sanctuary 
had two doors  24and the doors had ezekiel  
826 
 two leaves apiece  two turning 
leaves two leaves for the one door  
and two leaves for the other  25and 
there were made on them  on the doors 
of the temple  cherubim and palm 
trees  like as were made upon the 
walls  and there were thick beams of 
wood upon the face of the porch 
without  26and there were narrow 
windows and palm trees on the one 
side and on the other side  on the sides 
of the porch  there were also the 
brackets of the house  and the thick 
beams   
then he brought me forth into 
the outer court  the way 
toward the north  and h e brought me 
into the chamber that was over against 
the separate place  and which was over 
against the building  toward the north  
2even to the front of the length of a 
hundred cubits  with the door on the 
north  and the breadth of fifty cubits  
3over agai nst the twenty cubits which 
belonged to the inner court  and over 
against the pavement which belonged 
to the outer court  with gallery against 
gallery in three stories  4and before 
the chambers was a walk of ten cubits 
breadth inward  a way of one cubit  
and their doors were toward the north  
5now the upper chambers were 
shorter  for the galleries took away 
from these  more than from the lower 
and the middlemost  in the building  
6for they were in three stories  and 
they had not pillars as the pillars of th e 
courts  therefore room was taken away 
from the lowest and the middlemost  in comparison with the ground  7and the 
wall that was without by the side of 
the chambers  toward the outer court in 
front of the chambers  the length 
thereof was fifty cubits  8for the length 
of the chambers that were toward the 
outer court was fifty cubits  and lo 
before the temple were a hundred 
cubits  9and from under these 
chambers was the entry on the east 
side as one goeth into them from the 
outer court  10in the breadth o f the wall 
of the court toward the east  before the 
separate place  and before the building  
there were chambers  11with a way 
before them  like the appearance of the 
chambers which were toward the 
north  as long as they  and as broad as 
they with all the ir goings out  and 
according to their fashions  and as 
their doors  12so were also the doors of 
the chambers that were toward the 
south  there was a door in the head of 
the way  even the way directly before 
the wall  toward the way from the east  
as one en tereth into them   
13then said he unto me  the north 
chambers and the south chambers  
which are before the separate place  
they are the holy chambers  where the 
priests that are near unto the lord 
shall eat the most holy things  there 
shall they lay the m ost holy things  and 
the meal offering  and the sin offering  
and the guilt offering  for the place is 
holy 14when the priests enter in  then 
shall they not go out of the holy place 
into the outer court  but there they 
shall lay their garments wherein the y 42 ezekiel  
827 
 minister  for they are holy  and they 
shall put on other garments  and shall 
approach to that which pertaineth to 
the people   
15now when he had made an end of 
measuring the inner house  he brought 
me forth by the way of the gate whose 
prospect is towar d the east  and 
measured it round about  16he 
measured the east side with the 
measuring reed  five hundred reeds  
with the measuring reed round about  
17he measured the north side  five 
hundred reeds  with the measuring 
reed round about  18he measured the 
south side  five hundred reeds  with 
the measuring reed  19he turned about 
to the west side  and measured five 
hundred reeds with the measuring 
reed 20he measured it by the four 
sides  it had a wall round about  the 
length five hundred  and the breadth 
five hundred  to make a separation 
between that which was holy and that 
which was common   
afterward he brought me to 
the gate  even the gate that 
looketh toward the east  2and behold  
the glory of the god of israel came 
from the way of the east  and his  
voice was like the sound of many 
waters  and the earth did shine with 
his glory  3and the appearance of the 
vision which i saw was like the vision 
that i saw when i came to destroy the 
city and the visions were like the 
vision that i saw by the river che bar 
and i fell upon my face  4and the glory 
of the lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is 
toward the east  5and a spirit took me 
up and brought me into the inner 
court  and behold  the glory of the 
lord filled the house  6and i heard 
one speaking unto me out of the house  
and a man stood by me  7and he said 
unto me  son of man  this is the place 
of my throne  and the place of the 
soles of my feet  where i will dwell in 
the midst of the children of israel for 
ever and the hous e of israel shall no 
more defile my holy name  neither 
they nor their kings  by their harlotry  
and by the carcasses of their kings in 
their high places  8in their setting of 
their threshold by my threshold  and 
their door post beside my door post 
and th ere was but the wall between me 
and them  and they have defiled my 
holy name by their abominations 
which they have committed  wherefore 
i have consumed them in mine anger  
9now let them put away their harlotry  
and the carcasses of their kings  far 
from me  and i will dwell in the midst 
of them for ever   
10thou  son of man  show the house 
to the house of israel  that they may be 
ashamed of their iniquities  and let 
them measure accurately  11and if they 
be ashamed of all that they have done  
make known unt o them the form of the 
house  and the fashion thereof  and the 
goings out thereof  and the comings in 
thereof  and all the forms thereof  and 
all the ordinances thereof  and all the 
forms thereof  and all the laws thereof  
and write it in their sight  that they 43 ezekiel  
828 
 may keep the whole form thereof  and 
all the ordinances thereof  and do 
them   
12this is the law of the house  upon 
the top of the mountain the whole limit 
thereof round about shall be most holy  
behold  this is the law of the house   
13and these are  the measures of the 
altar by cubits the cubit is a cubit and 
a handbreadth  the bottom shall be a 
cubit  and the breadth a cubit  and the 
border thereof by the edge thereof 
round about a span  and this shall be 
the base of the altar  14and from the 
bottom  upon the ground to the lower 
settle shall be two cubits  and the 
breadth one cubit  and from the lesser 
settle to the greater settle shall be four 
cubits  and the breadth a cubit  15and 
the hearth shall be four cubits  and 
from the hearth and upward there  shall 
be four horns  16and the hearth shall 
be twelve cubits long by twelve broad  
square in the four sides thereof  17and 
the settle shall be fourteen cubits long 
by fourteen broad in the four sides 
thereof  and the border about it shall 
be half a cubit  and the bottom thereof 
shall be a cubit about  and the steps 
thereof shall look toward the east   
18and he said unto me  son of 
man thus saith the lord g od these 
are the ordinances of the altar in the 
day when they shall make it  to offer 
burnt offeri ngs thereon  and to dash 
blood against it  19thou shalt give to 
the priests the levites that are of the 
seed of zadok  who are near unto me  
to minister unto me  saith the lord god a young bullock for a sin 
offering  20and thou shalt take of the 
blood the reof and put it on the four 
horns of it  and on the four corners of 
the settle  and upon the border round 
about  thus shalt thou purify it and 
make atonement for it  21thou shalt 
also take the bullock of the sin 
offering  and it shall be burnt in the 
appo inted place of the house  without 
the sanctuary  22and on the second day 
thou shalt offer a he goat without 
blemish for a sin offering  and they 
shall purify the altar  as they did purify 
it with the bullock  23when thou hast 
made an end of purifying it  thou shalt 
offer a young bullock without blemish  
and a ram out of the flock without 
blemish  24and thou shalt present them 
before the lord and the priests shall 
cast salt upon them  and they shall 
offer them up for a burnt offering unto 
the lord 25seven days shalt thou 
prepare every day a goat for a sin 
offering  they shall also prepare a 
young bullock  and a ram out of the 
flock  without blemish  26seven days 
shall they make atonement for the altar 
and cleanse it  so shall they consecrate 
it 27and when they have accomplished 
the days  it shall be that upon the 
eighth day  and forward  the priests 
shall make your burnt offerings upon 
the altar  and your peace offerings  
and i will accept you  saith the lord 
god  
then he brought me back the 
way of the  outer gate of the 
sanctuary  which looketh toward the 44 ezekiel  
829 
 east and it was shut  2and the lord 
said unto me  this gate shall be shut  
it shall not be opened  neither shall any 
man enter in by it  for the lord the 
god of israel  hath entered in by it  
theref ore it shall be shut  3as for the 
prince  being a prince  he shall sit 
therein to eat bread before the lord 
he shall enter by the way of the porch 
of the gate  and shall go out by the 
way of the same   
4then he brought me the way of the 
north gate before  the house  and i 
looked  and behold  the glory of the 
lord filled the house of the lord and 
i fell upon my face  5and the lord 
said unto me  son of man  mark well  
and behold with thine eyes  and hear 
with thine ears all that i say unto thee 
concerning  all the ordinances of the 
house of the lord and all the laws 
thereof  and mark well the entering in 
of the house  with every going forth of 
the sanctuary  6and thou shalt say to 
the rebellious  even to the house of 
israel  thus saith the lord g od o ye 
house of israel  let it suffice you of all 
your abominations  7in that ye have 
brought in aliens  uncircumcised in 
heart and uncircumcised in flesh  to be 
in my sanctuary  to profane it  even 
my house  when ye offer my bread  
the fat and the blood  and they  have 
broken my covenant  to add unto all 
your abominations  8and ye have not 
kept the charge of my holy things  but 
ye have set keepers of my charge in 
my sanctuary to please yourselves   9thus saith the lord g od no alien  
uncircumcised in heart and 
uncircumcised in flesh  shall enter into 
my sanctuary  even any alien that is 
among the children of israel  10but the 
levites  that went far from me  when 
israel went astray  that went astray 
from me after their idols  they shall 
bear their iniquity  11and the y shall be 
ministers in my sanctuary  having 
charge at the gates of the house  and 
ministering in the house  they shall 
slay the burnt offering and the 
sacrifice for the people  and they shall 
stand before them to minister unto 
them  12because they ministe red unto 
them before their idols  and became a 
stumblingblock of iniquity unto the 
house of israel  therefore have i lifted 
up my hand against them  saith the 
lord g od and they shall bear their 
iniquity  13and they shall not come 
near unto me  to minister  unto me in 
the priest s office  nor to come near to 
any of my holy things  unto the things 
that are most holy  but they shall bear 
their shame  and their abominations 
which they have committed  14and i 
will make them keepers of the charge 
of the house  for all the service thereof  
and for all that shall be done therein   
15but the priests the levites  the 
sons of zadok  that kept the charge of 
my sanctuary when the children of 
israel went astray from me  they shall 
come near to me to minister unto me  
and they shall stand before me to offer 
unto me the fat and the blood  saith the 
lord g od 16they shall enter into my ezekiel  
830 
 sanctuary  and they shall come near to 
my table  to minister unto me  and 
they shall keep my charge  17and it 
shall be that when they enter in  at the 
gates of the inner court  they shall be 
clothed with linen garments  and no 
wool shall come upon them  while 
they minister in the gates of the inner 
court  and within  18they shall have 
linen tires upon their heads  and shall 
have linen breeches up on their loins  
they shall not gird themselves with any 
thing that causeth sweat  19and when 
they go forth into the outer court  even 
into the outer court to the people  they 
shall put off their garments wherein 
they minister  and lay them in the holy 
cham bers and they shall put on other 
garments  that they sanctify not the 
people with their garments  20neither 
shall they shave their heads  nor suffer 
their locks to grow long  they shall 
only poll their heads  21neither shall 
any priest drink wine  when th ey enter 
into the inner court  22neither shall 
they take for their wives a widow  nor 
her that is put away  but they shall take 
virgins of the seed of the house of 
israel  or a widow that is the widow of 
a priest  23and they shall teach my 
people the diffe rence between the holy 
and the common  and cause them to 
discern between the unclean and the 
clean  24and in a controversy they 
shall stand to judge  according to mine 
ordinances shall they judge it  and they 
shall keep my laws and my statutes in 
all my ap pointed seasons  and they 
shall hallow my sabbaths  25and they shall come near no dead person to 
defile themselves  but for father  or for 
mother  or for son  or for daughter  for 
brother  or for sister that hath had no 
husband  they may defile themselves  
26and after he is cleansed  they shall 
reckon unto him seven days  27and in 
the day that he goeth into the 
sanctuary  into the inner court  to 
minister in the sanctuary  he shall offer 
his sin offering  saith the lord g od 
28and it shall be unto them for an 
inheritance  i am their inheritance  and 
ye shall give them no possession in 
israel  i am their possession  29the 
meal offering  and the sin offering  
and the guilt offering  they even they  
shall eat  and every devoted thing in 
israel shall be theirs  30and the first of 
all the first fruits of every thing  and 
every heave offering of every thing  of 
all your offerings  shall be for the 
priests  ye shall also give unto the 
priest the first of your dough  to cause 
a blessing to rest on thy house  31the

19then he brought me through the 
entry  which was at the side of the 
gate into the holy chambers for the 
priests  which looked toward the north  
and behold  there was a place on the 
hinder part westward  20and he said 
unto me  this is the place where the 
priests shall boil the guilt offering and 
the sin offering  where they shall bake 
the meal offering  that they bring them 
not forth into the outer court  to 
sanctify the people   
21then he brought me forth into the 
outer court  and caused me to pass by 
the four corners of the court  and 
behold  in every corner of the court 
there was a court  22in the four corners 
of the court there were courts incl osed ezekiel  
834 
 forty cubits long and thirty broad  
these four in the corners were of one 
measure  23and there was a row of 
masonry round about in them  round 
about the four  and it was made with 
boiling places under the rows round 
about  24then said he unto me  these 
are the boiling places  where the 
ministers of the house shall boil the 
sacrifices of the people   
and he brought me back unto 
the door of the house  and 
behold  waters issued out from under 
the threshold of the house eastward  
for the forefront o f the house looked 
toward the east  and the waters came 
down from under  from the right side 
of the house  on the south of the altar  
2then brought he me out by the way of 
the gate northward  and led me round 
by the way without unto the outer gate  
by the way of the gate that looketh 
toward the east  and behold  there 
trickled forth waters on the right side   
3when the man went forth eastward 
with the line in his hand  he measured 
a thousand cubits  and he caused me to 
pass through the waters  waters that 
were to the ankles  4again he 
measured a thousand  and caused me 
to pass through the waters  waters that 
were to the knees  again he measured 
a thousand  and caused me to pass 
through waters that were to the loins  
5afterward he measured a thousand  
and it  was a river that i could not pass 
through  for the waters were risen  
waters to swim in  a river that could 
not be passed through  6and he said unto me  hast thou seen this  o son of 
man then he led me  and caused me 
to return to the bank of the river   
7now when i had been brought 
back  behold  upon the bank of the 
river were very many trees on the one 
side and on the other  8then said he 
unto me  these waters issue forth 
toward the eastern region  and shall go 
down into the arabah  and when they 
shall enter into the sea  into the sea of 
the putrid waters  the waters shall be 
healed  9and it shall come to pass  that 
every living creature wherewith it 
swarmeth  whithersoever the rivers 
shall come  shall live  and there shall 
be a very great multitude of  fish for 
these waters are come thither  that all 
things be healed and may live 
whithersoever the river cometh  10and 
it shall come to pass  that fishers shall 
stand by it from en gedi even unto en 
eglaim  there shall be a place for the 
spreading of nets  their fish shall be 
after their kinds  as the fish of the 
great sea  exceeding many  11but the 
miry places thereof  and the marshes 
thereof  shall not be healed  they shall 
be given for salt  12and by the river 
upon the bank thereof  on this side and 
on that side  shall grow every tree for 
food whose leaf shall not wither  
neither shall the fruit thereof fail  it 
shall bring forth new fruit every 
month  because the waters thereof 
issue out of the sanctuary  and the fruit 
thereof shall be for food  and the  leaf 
thereof for healing   47 ezekiel

hosea  
 
the word  of the lord that came 
unto hosea the son of beeri  in 
the days of uzziah  jotham  ahaz  and 
hezekiah  kings of judah  and in the 
days of jeroboam the son of joash  
king of israel   
2when the lord spoke at first with 
hosea  the lord said unto hosea  go 
take unto thee a wife of harlotry and 
children of harlotry  for the land doth 
commit great harlotry  departing from 
the lord 3so he went and took 
gomer the daughter of diblaim  and 
she conceived  and bore him a son  
4and the lord said unto him  call his 
name jezreel  for yet a little while  and 
i will visit the blood of jezreel upon 
the house of jehu  and will cause to 
cease the kingdom of the house of 
israel  5and it shall come to pass at 
that day  that i will break the bow of 
israel in the valley of jezreel  6and 
she conceived again  and bore a 
daughter  and he said unto him  call 
her name aloruhamah  for i will no 
more have compassion upon the house 
of israel  that i should in any wise 
pardon them  7but i will have 
compassion u pon the house of judah  
and will save them by the lord their 
god and will not save them by bow  
                                                      
a that is that hath not obtained 
compassion  nor by sword  nor by battle  nor by 
horses  nor by horsemen  8now when 
she had weaned lo ruhamah  she 
conceived  and bore a son  9and he 
said call his name bloammi  for ye 
are not my people  and i will not be 
yours   
 
yet the number of the children of 
israel shall be as the sand of the 
sea which cannot be measured nor 
numbered  and it shall come to pass 
that instead of that which was said 
unto them  ye are not my people  it 
shall be said unto them  ye are the 
children of the living god  2and the 
children of judah and the children of 
israel shall be gathered together  and 
they shall appoint themselves one 
head  and shall go up out of the land  
for gre at shall be the day of jezreel  
3say ye unto your brethren  cammi  
and to your sisters  druhamah   
 
4plead with your mother  plead   
for she is not my wife  neither am i 
her husband   
and let her put away her harlotries 
from her face   
                                                      
b that is not my people  
c that is my people  
d that is that hath obtained 
compassion  1 
2 hosea  
839 
 and her adulteri es from between her 
breasts   
5lest i strip her naked   
and set her as in the day that she 
was born   
and make her as a wilderness   
and set her like a dry land   
and slay her with thirst   
6and i will not have compassion 
upon her children   
for they are c hildren of harlotry   
7for their mother hath played the 
harlot   
she that conceived them hath done 
shamefully   
for she said  i will go after my 
lovers   
that give me my bread and my 
water   
my wool and my flax  mine oil and 
my drink   
8therefore  behold  i will hedge up 
thy way with thorns   
and i will make a wall against her   
that she shall not find her paths   
9and she shall run after her lovers  
but she shall not overtake them   
and she shall seek them  but shall 
not find them   
then shall she say  i will go and 
return to my first husband   
for then was it better with me than 
now  
10for she did not know that it was i 
that gave her  
the corn  and the wine  and the oil   
and multiplied unto her silver and 
gold  
which they used for baal   11therefore  will i take back my corn 
in the time thereof   
and my wine in the season thereof   
and will snatch away my wool and 
my flax  
given to cover her nakedness   
12and now will i uncover her shame 
in the sight of her lovers   
and none shall deliver her out of 
my hand   
13i will also cause all her mirth to 
cease   
her feasts  her new moons  and her 
sabbaths   
and all her appointed seasons   
14and i will lay waste her vines and 
her fig trees   
whereof she hath said  these are 
my hire  
that my lovers have given me   
and i will make them a forest   
and the beasts of the field shall eat 
them   
15and i will visit upon her the days 
of the baalim   
wherein she offered unto them   
and decked herself with her ear 
rings and her jewels   
and went after her lovers   
and for got me  saith the lord  
16therefore  behold  i will allure 
her  
and bring her into the wilderness   
and speak tenderly unto her   
17and i will give her her vineyards 
from thence   hosea  
840 
 and the valley of aachor for a door 
of hope   
and she shall respond there  as in 
the days of her youth   
and as in the day when she came up 
out of the land of egypt   
 
18and it shall be at that day  saith 
the lord  
that thou shalt call me bishi  
and shalt call me no more cbaali   
19for i will take away the names of 
the baalim out of her mouth   
and they shall no more be 
mentioned by their name   
20and in that day will i make a 
covenant for them  
with the beasts of the field  and 
with the fowls of heaven   
and with the creeping things of the 
ground   
and i will break the bow and  the 
sword and the battle out of the 
land  
and will make them to lie down 
safely   
21and i will betroth thee unto me 
for ever   
yea i will betroth thee unto me in 
righteousness  and in justice   
and in lovingkindness  and in 
compassion   
22and i will bet roth thee unto me in 
faithfulness   
and thou shalt know the lord  
                                                      
a that is troubling  
b that is my husband  
c that is my master  23and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
i will respond  saith the lord i will 
respond to the heavens   
and they shall respond to the earth   
24and the earth shall respond to the 
corn and the wine  and the oil   
and they shall respond to djezreel   
25and i will sow her unto me in the 
land  
and i will have compassion upon 
her that had not obtained 
compassion   
and i will say to them that were not 
my people  thou art my 
people   
and they  shall say  thou art my 
god  
 
and the lord said unto me  go 
yet love a woman beloved of her 
friend and an adulteress  even as the 
lord loveth the children of israel  
though they turn unto other gods  and 
love cakes of raisins  2so i bought her 
to me  for fifteen pieces of silver and a 
homer of barley  and a half homer of 
barley  3and i said unto her  thou 
shalt sit solitary for me many days  
thou shalt not play the harlot  and thou 
shalt not be any man s wife  nor will i 
be thine  4for the children of israel 
shall sit solitary many days without 
king and without prince  and without 
sacrifice  and without pillar  and 
without ephod or teraphim  5afterward 
shall the children of israel return  and 
                                                      
d that is whom god soweth  3 hosea  
841 
 seek the lord their god  and david 
their king  and shall come trembling 
unto the lord and to his goodness in 
the end of days   
 
hear the word of the lord ye 
 children of israel   
for the lord hath a controversy 
with the inhabitants of the land   
because there is no truth  nor mercy   
nor knowledge of god in t he land   
2swearing and lying  and killing  
and stealing  and committing 
adultery   
they break all bounds  and blood 
toucheth blood   
3therefore doth the land mourn   
and every one that dwelleth therein 
doth languish   
with the beasts of the field  and the  
fowls of heaven   
yea the fishes of the sea also are 
taken away   
 
4yet let no man strive  neither let 
any man reprove   
for thy people are as they that strive 
with the priest   
5therefore shalt thou stumble in the 
day  
and the prophet also shall stumbl e 
with thee in the night   
and i will destroy thy mother   
6my people are destroyed for lack of 
knowledge   
because thou hast rejected 
knowledge   
i will also reject thee  that thou shalt 
be no priest to me   seeing thou hast forgotten the law 
of thy god   
i also will forget thy children   
 
7the more they were increased  the 
more they sinned against me   
i will change their glory into shame   
8they feed on the sin of my people   
and set their heart on their iniquity   
9and it is like people  like priest   
and i will punish him for his ways   
and will recompense him his 
doings   
10and they shall eat  and not have 
enough   
they shall commit harlotry  and 
shall not increase   
because they have left off to take 
heed to the lord  
11harlotry  wine  and new wine t ake 
away the heart   
12my people ask counsel at their 
stock   
and their staff declareth unto them   
for the spirit of harlotry hath caused 
them to err   
and they have gone astray from 
under their god   
13they sacrifice upon the tops of the 
mountains   
and offer upon the hills   
under oaks and poplars and 
terebinths   
because the shadow thereof is good   
therefore your daughters commit 
harlotry   
and your daughters inlaw commit 
adultery   4 hosea  
842 
 14i will not punish your daughters 
when they commit harlotry   
nor yo ur daughters inlaw when 
they commit adultery   
for they themselves consort with 
lewd women   
and they sacrifice with harlots   
and the people that is without 
understanding is distraught   
 
15though thou  israel  play the 
harlot   
yet let not judah become guilty   
and come not ye unto gilgal   
neither go ye up to beth aven   
nor swear  as the lord liveth   
16for israel is stubborn like a 
stubborn heifer   
now shall the lord feed them as a 
lamb in a large place   
17ephraim is joined to idols   
let him alon e  
18when their carouse is over   
they take to harlotry   
her rulers deeply love dishonour   
19the wind hath bound her up in her 
skirts   
and they shall be ashamed because 
of their sacrifices   
 
hear this  o ye priests   
and attend  ye house of israel   
and give ear  o house of the king   
for unto you pertaineth the 
judgment   
for ye have been a snare on mizpah   
and a net spread upon tabor   
2and they that fall away are gone 
deep in making slaughter   and i am rejected of them all   
3i even i  know eph raim  
and israel is not hid from me   
for now  o ephraim  thou hast 
committed harlotry   
israel is defiled   
4their doings will not suffer them  
to return unto their god   
for the spirit of harlotry is within 
them   
and they know not the lord  
5but the p ride of israel shall testify 
to his face   
and israel and ephraim shall 
stumble in their iniquity   
judah also shall stumble with them   
6with their flocks and with their 
herds they shall go  
to seek the lord but they shall not 
find him   
he hath withdraw n himself from 
them   
7they have dealt treacherously 
against the lord  
for they have begotten strange 
children   
now shall the new moon devour 
them with their portions   
 
8blow ye the horn in gibeah   
and the trumpet in ramah   
sound an alarm at beth aven   
behind thee  o benjamin    
9ephraim shall be desolate in the 
day of rebuke   
among the tribes of israel do i 
make known that which shall 
surely be   5 hosea  
843 
 10the princes of judah are like them 
that remove the landmark   
i will pour out my wrath upon them 
like water   
11oppressed is ephraim  crushed in 
his right   
because he willingly walked after 
filth  
12therefore am i unto ephraim as a 
moth   
and to the house of judah as 
rottenness   
13and when ephraim saw his 
sickness   
and judah his wound   
ephraim went to assyria   
and sent to king contentious   
but he is not able to heal you   
neither shall he cure you of your 
wound   
14for i will be unto ephraim as a 
lion  
and as a young lion to the house of 
judah   
i even i  will tear and go away   
i will take away  and there shall be 
none to deliver   
15i will go and return to my place   
till they acknowledge their guilt  
and seek my face   
in their trouble they will seek me 
earnestly   
come  and let us return unto the 
 lord  
for he hath torn  and he will heal 
us  
he hath smitten  and he will bind us 
up  
2after two days will he revive us   on the third day he will raise us up  
that we may live in his presence   
3and let us know  eagerly strive to 
know the lord  
his going forth is sure as the 
morning   
and he s hall come unto us as the 
rain  
as the latter rain that watereth the 
earth   
 
4o ephraim  what shall i do unto 
thee  
o judah  what shall i do unto thee   
for your goodness is as a morning 
cloud   
and as the dew that early passeth 
away   
5therefore have i  hewed them by 
the prophets   
i have slain them by the words of 
my mouth   
and thy judgment goeth forth as the 
light  
6for i desire mercy  and not 
sacrifice   
and the knowledge of god rather 
than burnt offerings   
 
7but they like men have 
transgressed the  covenant   
there have they dealt treacherously 
against me   
8gilead is a city of them that work 
iniquity   
it is covered with footprints of 
blood   
9and as troops of robbers wait for a 
man  6 hosea  
844 
 so doth the company of priests   
they murder in the way toward 
shechem   
yea they commit enormity   
10in the house of israel i have seen a 
horrible thing   
there harlotry is found in ephraim  
israel is defiled   
11also  o judah  there is a harvest 
appointed for thee   
 
when i would turn the captivity of 
my people   
when i would heal israel   
then is the iniquity of ephraim  
   uncovered   
and the wickedness of samaria   
for they commit falsehood   
and the thief entereth in   
and the troop of robbers maketh a 
raid without   
2and let them not say to their 
heart  
i reme mber all their wickedness   
now their own doings have beset 
them about   
they are before my face   
3they make the king glad with their 
wickedness   
and the princes with their lies   
4they are all adulterers   
as an oven heated by the baker   
who ceaseth to  stir  
from the kneading of the dough 
until it be leavened   
5on the day of our king  
the princes make him sick with the 
heat of wine   he stretcheth out his hand with 
scorners   
6for they have made ready their 
heart like an oven  while they lie 
in wait   
their baker sleepeth all the night   
in the morning it burneth as a 
flaming fire   
7they are all hot as an oven   
and devour their judges   
all their kings are fallen   
there is none among them that 
calleth unto me   
 
8ephraim  he mixeth himself with 
the p eoples   
ephraim is become a cake not 
turned   
9strangers have devoured his 
strength   
and he knoweth it not   
yea gray hairs are here and there 
upon him   
and he knoweth it not   
10and the pride of israel testifieth to 
his face   
but they have not return ed unto the 
lord their god   
nor sought him  for all this   
11and ephraim is become like a 
silly dove  without understanding   
they call unto egypt  they go to 
assyria   
12even as they go  i will spread my 
net upon them   
i will bring them down as the fowl s 
of the heaven   7 hosea  
845 
 i will chastise them  as their 
congregation hath been made to 
hear  
13woe unto them  for they have 
strayed from me   
destruction unto them  for they 
have transgressed against me   
shall i then redeem them   
seeing they have spoken lies a gainst 
me  
14and they have not cried unto me 
with their heart   
though they wail upon their beds   
they assemble themselves for corn 
and wine  they rebel against me   
15though i have trained and 
strengthened their arms   
yet do they devise evil against me   
16they return  but not upwards   
they are become like a deceitful 
bow  
their princes shall fall by the sword 
for the rage of their tongue   
this shall be their derision in the 
land of egypt   
 
set the horn to thy mouth   
as a vulture he cometh agains t 
 the  house of the lord  
because they have transgressed my 
covenant   
and trespassed against my law   
2will they cry unto me   
my god  we israel know thee   
3israel hath cast off that which is 
good   
the enemy shall pursue him   
4they have set up king s but not 
from me   they have made princes  and i knew 
it not   
of their silver and their gold have 
they made them idols   
that they may be cut off   
5thy calf  o samaria  is cast off   
mine anger is kindled against them   
how long will it be ere they att ain to 
innocency   
6for from israel is even this   
the craftsman made it  and it is no 
god  
yea the calf of samaria shall be 
broken in shivers   
7for they sow the wind  and they 
shall reap the whirlwind   
it hath no stalk  the bud that shall 
yield no mea l  
if so be it yield  strangers shall 
swallow it up   
 
8israel is swallowed up   
now are they become among the 
nations  
as a vessel wherein is no value   
9for they are gone up to assyria   
like a wild ass alone by himself   
ephraim hath hired lovers   
10yea though they hire among the 
nations   
now will i gather them up   
and they begin to be minished  
by reason of the burden of king and 
princes   
11for ephraim hath multiplied altars 
to sin   
yea altars have been unto him to 
sin  8 hosea  
846 
 12though i write for him  never so 
many things of my law   
they are accounted as a stranger s  
13as for the sacrifices that are made 
by fire unto me   
let them sacrifice flesh and eat it   
for the lord accepteth them not   
now will he remember their 
iniquity  and punish their sin s  
they shall return to egypt   
14for israel hath forgotten his 
maker   
and builded palaces   
and judah hath multiplied fortified 
cities   
but i will send a fire upon his cities   
and it shall devour the castles 
thereof   
 
rejoice not  o israel  unto 
 exultation  like the peoples   
for thou hast gone astray from thy 
god  
thou hast loved a harlot s hire upon 
every corn floor   
2the threshing floor and the wine 
press shall not feed them   
and the new wine shall fail her   
3they shall not dwell in the l ords 
land  
but ephraim shall return to egypt   
and they shall eat unclean food in 
assyria   
4they shall not pour out wine 
offerings to the lord  
neither shall they be pleasing unto 
him  
their sacrifices shall be unto them 
as the bread of mourners   all that eat thereof shall be polluted   
for their bread shall be for their 
appetite   
it shall not come into the house of 
the lord  
5what will ye do in the day of the 
appointed season   
and in the day of the feast of the 
lord  
6for lo they are gone away fro m 
destruction   
yet egypt shall gather them up   
memphis shall bury them   
their precious treasures of silver  
nettles shall possess them   
thorns shall be in their tents   
7the days of visitation are come   
the days of recompense are come   
israel shall k now it   
the prophet is a fool  the man of the 
spirit is mad   
for the multitude of thine iniquity  
the enmity is great   
8ephraim is a watchman with my 
god  
as for the prophet  a fowler s snare 
is in all his ways   
and enmity in the house of his god   
9they have deeply corrupted 
themselves   
as in the days of gibeah   
he will remember their iniquity   
he will punish their sins   
 
10i found israel like grapes in the 
wilderness   
i saw your fathers as the first ripe in 
the fig tree at her first season   9 hosea  
847 
 but so soon as they came to baal 
peor  
they separated themselves unto the 
shameful thing   
and became detestable like that 
which they loved   
11as for ephraim  their glory shall 
fly away like a bird   
there shall be no birth  and none 
with child  and no conc eption   
12yea though they bring up their 
children   
yet will i bereave them  that there 
be not a man left   
yea woe also to them when i depart 
from them   
13ephraim  like as i have seen tyre  
is planted in a pleasant place   
but ephraim shall bring fort h his 
children to the slayer   
14give them  o lord whatsoever 
thou wilt give   
give them a miscarrying womb and 
dry breasts   
15all their wickedness is in gilgal   
for there i hated them   
because of the wickedness of their 
doings  
i will drive them out o f my house   
i will love them no more   
all their princes are rebellious   
16ephraim is smitten   
their root is dried up   
they shall bear no fruit   
yea though they bring forth   
yet will i slay the beloved fruit of 
their womb   
17my god will cast them a way  because they did not hearken unto 
him  
and they shall be wanderers among 
the nations   
 
israel was a luxuriant vine  
which put forth fruit freely   
as his fruit increased   
he increased his altars   
the more goodly his land was   
the more goodly were his pillars   
2their heart is divided   
now shall they bear their guilt   
he will break down their altars   
he will spoil their pillars   
3surely now shall they say   
we have no king   
for we feared not the lord  
and the king  what can he do for 
us  
4they speak words   
they swear falsely  they make 
covenants   
thus judgment springeth up as 
hemlock  
in the furrows of the field   
5the inhabitants of samaria shall be 
in dread  
for the calves of beth aven   
for the people thereof shall mourn 
over it   
and the priests thereof shall tremble 
for it   
for its glory  because it is departed 
from it   
6it also shall be carried unto 
assyria   
for a present to king contentious   
ephraim shall receive shame   10 hosea  
848 
 and israel shall be ashamed of his 
own counsel   
7as for samaria  her king is cut off   
as foam upon the water   
8the high places also of aven shall 
be destroyed   
even the sin of israel   
the thorn and the thistle shall come 
up on their altars   
and they shall say to the mountains  
cover us   
and to the hi lls fall on us   
 
9from the days of gibeah thou hast 
sinned  o israel   
there they stood   
no battle was to overtake them in 
gibeah   
nor the children of arrogancy   
10when it is my desire  i will 
chastise them   
and the peoples shall be gathered 
agains t them   
when they are yoked to their two 
rings   
11and ephraim is a heifer well 
broken   
that loveth to thresh   
and i have passed over upon her 
fair neck   
i will make ephraim to ride  judah 
shall plow   
jacob shall break his clods   
12sow to yourselves according to 
righteousness   
reap according to mercy   
break up your fallow ground   
for it is time to seek the lord  till he come and cause 
righteousness to rain upon you   
13ye have plowed wickedness  ye 
have reaped iniquity   
ye have eaten the fruit of  lies  
for thou didst trust in thy way   
in the multitude of thy mighty men   
14therefore shall a tumult arise 
among thy hosts   
and all thy fortresses shall be 
spoiled   
as shalman spoiled beth arbel in 
the day of battle   
the mother was dashed in pieces  
with her children   
15so hath beth el done unto you  
because of your great wickedness   
at daybreak is the king of israel 
utterly cut off   
 
when israel was a child  then i 
 loved him   
and out of egypt i called my son   
2the more they called them  the 
more they went from them   
they sacrificed unto the baalim   
and offered to graven images   
3and i  i taught ephraim to walk   
taking them by their arms   
but they knew not that i healed 
them   
4i drew them with cords of a man   
with bands of love   
and i was to them as they that take 
off the yoke on their jaws   
and i fed them gently   
5he shall not return into the land of 
egypt   
but the assyrian shall be his king   11 hosea  
849 
 because they refused to return   
6and the sword shall fall upon his 
cities   
and shall co nsume his bars  and 
devour them   
because of their own counsels   
 
7and my people are in suspense 
about returning to me   
and though they call them upwards   
none at all will lift himself up   
8how shall i give thee up  ephraim   
how shall i surrender thee  israel   
how shall i make thee as admah   
how shall i set thee as zeboim   
my heart is turned within me  
my compassions are kindled 
together   
9i will not execute the fierceness of 
mine anger   
i will not return to destroy ephraim   
for i am god  and not  man  
the holy one in the midst of thee   
and i will not come in fury   
10they shall walk after the lord  
who shall roar like a lion   
for he shall roar   
and the children shall come 
trembling from the west   
11they shall come trembling as a 
bird out of egypt   
and as a dove out of the land of 
assyria   
and i will make them to dwell in 
their houses  saith the lord  
 
ephraim compasseth me about 
with lies   
and the house of israel with deceit   and judah is yet wayward towards 
god  
and towards the holy  one who is 
faithful   
2ephraim striveth after wind  and 
followeth after the east wind   
all the day he multiplieth lies and 
desolation   
and they make a covenant with 
assyria   
and oil is carried into egypt   
3the lord hath also a controversy 
with judah   
and will punish jacob according to 
his ways   
according to his doings will he 
recompense him   
4in the womb he took his brother by 
the heel   
and by his strength he strove with a 
godlike being   
5so he strove with an angel  and 
prevailed   
he wept  and ma de supplication 
unto him   
at beth el he would find him   
and there he would speak with us   
6but the lord the god of hosts   
the lord is his name   
7therefore turn thou to thy god   
keep mercy and justice   
and wait for thy god continually   
8as for the trafficker  the balances 
of deceit are in his hand   
he loveth to oppress   
9and ephraim said  surely i am 
become rich   
i have found me wealth   12 hosea  
850 
 in all my labours they shall find in 
me  
no iniquity that were sin   
10but i am the lord thy god  
from the l and of egypt   
i will yet again make thee to dwell 
in tents   
as in the days of the appointed 
season   
11i have also spoken unto the 
prophets   
and i have multiplied visions   
and by the ministry of the prophets 
have i used similitudes   
12if gilead be giv en to iniquity  
becoming altogether vanity   
in gilgal they sacrifice unto 
bullocks   
yea their altars shall be as heaps  
in the furrows of the field   
 
13and jacob fled into the field of 
aram   
and israel served for a wife   
and for a wife he kept sheep   
14and by a prophet the lord brought 
israel up out of egypt   
and by a prophet was he kept   
15ephraim hath provoked most 
bitterly   
therefore shall his blood be cast 
upon him   
and his reproach shall his lord 
return unto him   
 
when ephraim spoke  there 
was trembling   
he exalted himself in israel   but when he became guilty through 
baal he died   
2and now they sin more and more   
and have made them molten images 
of their silver   
according to their own 
understanding  even idols   
all of them the work  of the 
craftsmen   
of them they say   
they that sacrifice men kiss 
calves   
3therefore they shall be as the 
morning cloud   
and as the dew that early passeth 
away   
as the chaff that is driven with the 
wind out of the threshing floor   
and as the smoke out of the 
window   
 
4yet i am the lord thy god  
from the land of egypt   
and thou knowest no god but me   
and beside me there is no saviour   
5i did know thee in the wilderness   
in the land of great drought   
6when they were fed  they became 
full  
they were filled  and their heart was 
exalted   
therefore have they forgotten me   
7therefore am i become unto them 
as a lion   
as a leopard will i watch by the 
way  
8i will meet them as a bear that is 
bereaved of her whelps   13 hosea  
851 
 and will rend the enclosure of th eir 
heart   
and there will i devour them like a 
lioness   
the wild beast shall tear them   
 
9it is thy destruction  o israel   
that thou art against me  against thy 
help  
10ho now thy king   
that he may save thee in all thy 
cities   
and thy judges  of whom thou 
saidst   
give me a king and princes    
11i give thee a king in mine anger   
and take him away in my wrath   
 
12the iniquity of ephraim is bound 
up  
his sin is laid up in store   
13the throes of a travailing woman 
shall come upon him   
he is an unwise son   
for it is time he should not tarry  
in the place of the breaking forth of 
children   
14shall i ransom them from the 
power of the nether world   
shall i redeem them from death   
ho thy plagues  o death   
ho thy destruction  o netherworld   
repentance be hid from mine eyes   
15for though he be fruitful among 
the reed plants   
an east wind shall come  the wind 
of the lord coming up from the 
wilderness   and his spring shall become dry  
and his fountain shall be dried up   
he shall spoil the trea sure of all 
precious vessels   
 
samaria shall bear her guilt   
for she hath rebelled against 
her god   
they shall fall by the sword   
their infants shall be dashed in 
pieces   
and their women with child shall be 
ripped up   
2return  o israel  unto the lord thy 
god  
for thou hast stumbled in thine 
iniquity   
3take with you words   
and return unto the lord  
say unto him  forgive all iniquity   
and accept that which is good   
so will we render for bullocks the 
offering of our lips   
4asshur shall not sav e us  
we will not ride upon horses   
neither will we call any more the 
work of our hands our gods   
for in thee the fatherless findeth 
mercy   
5i will heal their backsliding   
i will love them freely   
for mine anger is turned away from 
him  
6i will be as the dew unto israel   
he shall blossom as the lily   
and cast forth his roots as lebanon   
7his branches shall spread   
and his beauty shall be as the olive 
tree  14 hosea  
852 
 and his fragrance as lebanon   
8they that dwell under his shadow 
shall again  
make corn t o grow   
and shall blossom as the vine   
the scent thereof shall be as the 
wine of lebanon   
9ephraim shall say   
what have i to do any more with 
idols   
as for me  i respond and look on 
him  i am like a leafy cypress tree  
from me is thy fruit found   
10whoso is wise  let him understand 
these things   
whoso is prudent  let him know 
them   
for the ways of the lord are right   
and the just do walk in them   
but transgressors do stumble 
therein

a great people and a mighty

the land is as the garden of eden 
before them

wilderness

4the appearance of them is as the 
appearance of horses   
and as horsemen  so do they run   
5like the noise of chariots   
on the tops of the mountains do 
they leap   
like th e noise of a flame of fire  
that devoureth the stubble   
as a mighty people set in battle 
array   
6at their presence the peoples are in 
anguish   
all faces have gathered blackness   
7they run like mighty men   
they climb the wall like men of 
war  
and they  move on every one in his 
ways   
and they entangle not their paths   
8neither doth one thrust another   
they march every one in his 
highway   and they break through the 
weapons   
and suffer no harm   
9they leap upon the city   
they run upon the wall   
they climb up into the houses   
they enter in at the windows like a 
thief  
10before them the earth quaketh   
the heavens tremble   
the sun and the moon are become 
black   
and the stars withdraw their 
shining   
11and the lord uttereth his voice 
before his army   
for his camp is very great   
for he is mighty that executeth his 
word   
for great is the day of the lord and 
very terrible   
and who can abide it   
 
12yet even now  saith the lord  
turn ye unto me with all your heart   
and with fasting  and with weepin g 
and with lamentation   
13and rend your heart  and not your 
garments   
and turn unto the lord your god   
for he is gracious and 
compassionate  longsuffering  
and abundant in mercy   
and repenteth him of the evil

17let the priests  the ministers of the 
lord  
weep between the porch and the 
altar  
and let them say  spare thy pe ople 
o lord  
and give not thy heritage to 
reproach   
that the nations should make them a 
byword   
wherefore should they say among 
the peoples   
where is their god   
18then was the lord jealous for his 
land  
and had pity on his people   
19and the lord answered and said 
unto his people   
behold  i will send you corn  and 
wine  and oil   
and ye shall be satisfied therewith   
and i will no more make you a 
reproach among the nations   
20but i will remove far off from you 
the northern one   and will drive hi m into a land 
barren and desolate   
with his face toward the eastern sea   
and his hinder part toward the 
western sea   
that his foulness may come up  and 
his ill savour may come up   
because he hath done great things   
 
21fear not  o land  be glad and 
rejoice   
for the lord hath done great things   
22be not afraid  ye beasts of the 
field  
for the pastures of the wilderness do 
spring   
for the tree beareth its fruit   
the fig tree and the vine do yield 
their strength   
23be glad then  ye children of zion  
and rejoice  
in the lord your god   
for he giveth you the former rain in 
just measure   
and he causeth to come down for 
you the rain   
the former rain and the latter rain  
at the first   
24and the floors shall be full of 
corn  
and the vats shall overflow  with 
wine and oil   
25and i will restore to you the years 
that the locust hath eaten   
the canker worm  and the 
caterpiller  and the palmer worm   
my great army which i sent among 
you  joel  
856 
 26and ye shall eat in plenty and be 
satisfied   
and shall praise the name of the 
lord your god   
that hath dealt wondrously with 
you  
and my people shall never be 
ashamed   
27and ye shall know that i am in the 
midst of israel   
and that i am the lord your god  
and there is none else   
and my people shall never be 
ashamed   
 
and it shall come to pass 
 afterward   
that i will pour out my spirit upon 
 all flesh   
and your sons and your daughters 
shall prophesy   
your old men shall dream dreams   
your young men shall see visions   
2and also upon the servants and 
upon the hand maids  
in those days will i pour out my 
spirit   
3and i will shew wonders in the 
heavens and in the earth   
blood and fire  and pillars of 
smoke   
4the sun shall be turned into 
darkness   
and the moon into blood   
before the great and terrible day of 
the lord come   
5and it shall come to pass  that 
whosoever shall call on the name 
of the lord shall be delivered   for in mount zion and in jerusalem 
there shall be those that escape   
as the lord hath said   
and among the remnant those 
whom the lord shall cal l  
 
for behold  in those days  and in 
 that time   
when i shall bring back the 
captivity of judah and jerusalem   
2i will gather all nations   
and will bring them down into the 
valley of jehoshaphat   
and i will enter into judgment with 
them there  
for my people and for my heritage 
israel   
whom they have scattered among 
the nations   
and divided my land   
3and they have cast lots for my 
people   
and have given a boy for an harlot   
and sold a girl for wine  and have 
drunk   
 
4and also what are ye to me  o 
tyre  and zidon  and all the regions of 
philistia  will ye render retribution on 
my behalf  and if ye render retribution 
on my behalf  swiftly  speedily will i 
return your retribution upon your own 
head  5forasmuch as ye have taken my 
silver and my gol d and have carried 
into your temples my goodly 
treasures  6the children also of judah 
and the children of jerusalem have ye 
sold unto the sons of jevanim  that ye 
might remove them far from their 3 4 joel  
857 
 border  7behold  i will stir them up out 
of the place whith er ye have sold 
them  and will return your retribution 
upon your own head  8and i will sell 
your sons and your daughters into the 
hand of the children of judah  and they 
shall sell them to the men of sheba  to 
a nation far off  for the lord hath 
spoken   
 
9proclaim ye this among the nations   
prepare war   
stir up the mighty men   
let all the men of war draw near   
let them come up   
10beat your plowshares into swords   
and your pruning hooks into spears   
let the weak say  i am strong   
11haste ye  and c ome all ye nations 
round about   
and gather yourselves together   
thither cause thy mighty ones to 
come down  o lord  
12let the nations be stirred up  and 
come up  
to the valley of ajehoshaphat   
for there will i sit to judge  
all the nations round about   
13put ye in the sickle   
for the harvest is ripe   
come tread ye   
for the winepress is full  the vats 
overflow   
for their wickedness is great   
 
14multitudes  multitudes in the 
valley of decision   
                                                      
a that is the lord judgeth  for the day of the lord is near in 
the valley of dec ision   
15the sun and the moon are become 
black   
and the stars withdraw their 
shining   
16and the lord shall roar from zion   
and utter his voice from jerusalem   
and the heavens and the earth shall 
shake   
but the lord will be a refuge unto 
his people   
and a stronghold to the children of 
israel   
17so shall ye know that i am the 
lord your god   
dwelling in zion my holy 
mountain   
then shall jerusalem be holy   
and there shall no strangers pass 
through her any more   
 
18and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that the mountains shall drop down 
sweet wine   
and the hills shall flow with milk   
and all the brooks of judah shall 
flow with waters   
and a fountain shall come forth of 
the house of the lord  
and shall water the valley of 
shittim   
19egypt shall be a desolation   
and edom shall be a desolate 
wilderness   
for the violence against the children 
of judah   joel  
858 
 because they have shed innocent 
blood in their land   
20but judah shall be inhabited for 
ever  
and jerusalem from generation to 
generation   21and i will hold as innocent their 
blood that i have not held as 
innocent   
and the lord dwelleth in zion   
 
  
amos  
 
the words  of amos  who was 
among the herdmen of tekoa  
which he saw concerning israel in the 
days of uzziah king of judah  and in 
the days of jeroboam the son of joash 
king of israel  two years before the 
earthquake   
 
2and he said   
the lord roareth from zion   
and uttereth his voice from 
jerusalem  and the pastures of the 
shepherds shall mourn  and the 
top of carmel shall wither   
 
3for thus saith the lord for three 
transgressions of damascus  yea 
for four  i will not reverse it  
because they have threshed 
gilead with sledges of iron   
4so will i send a fire into the house 
of hazael  and it shall devour the 
palaces of ben hadad   
5and i will break the bar of 
damascus  and cut off the 
inhabitant from bikath aven  and him that holdeth the sceptre from 
beth eden  and the people of 
aram shall go into captivity unto 
kir saith the lord  
 
6thus saith the lord for three 
transgressions of g aza yea for 
four i will not reverse it  because 
they carried away captive a whole 
captivity  to deliver them up to 
edom   
7so will i send a fire on the wall of 
gaza  and it shall devour the 
palaces thereof   
8and i will cut off the inhabitant 
from ashdo d and him that 
holdeth the sceptre from 
ashkelon  and i will turn my 
hand against ekron  and the 
remnant of the philistines shall 
perish  saith the lord g od  
 
9thus saith the lord for three 
transgressions of tyre  yea for 
four i will not reverse it  because 
they delivered up a whole 1 amos  
859 
 captivity to edom  and 
remembered not the brotherly 
covenant   
10so will i send a fire on the wall of 
tyre  and it shall devour the 
palaces thereof   
 
11thus saith the lord for three 
transgressions of edom  yea for 
four i will not reverse it  because 
he did pursue his brother with the 
sword  and did cast off all pity  
and his anger did tear perpetually  
and he kept his wrath for ever   
12so will i send a fire upon teman  
and it shall devour the palaces of 
bozrah   
 
13thus  saith the lord for three 
transgressions of the children of 
ammon  yea for four  i will not 
reverse it  because they have 
ripped up the women with child 
of gilead  that they might enlarge 
their border   
14so will i kindle a fire in the wall of 
rabbah  and it shall devour the 
palaces thereof  with shouting in 
the day of battle  with a tempest 
in the day of the whirlwind   
15and their king shall go into 
captivity  he and his princes 
together  saith the lord  
 
thus saith the lord  
for three transgression s of moab   
yea for four  i will not reverse it   
because he burned the bones of the 
king of edom into lime   2so will i send a fire upon moab   
and it shall devour the palaces of 
kerioth   
and moab shall die with tumult   
with shouting  and with the soun d 
of the horn   
3and i will cut off the judge from 
the midst thereof   
and will slay all the princes thereof 
with him   
saith the lord  
 
4thus saith the lord  
for three transgressions of judah   
yea for four  i will not reverse it   
because they have re jected the law 
of the lord  
and have not kept his statutes   
and their lies have caused them to 
err  
after which their fathers did walk   
5so will i send a fire upon judah   
and it shall devour the palaces of 
jerusalem   
 
6thus saith the lord  
for three  transgressions of israel   
yea for four  i will not reverse it   
because they sell the righteous for 
silver   
and the needy for a pair of shoes   
7that pant after the dust of the earth 
on the head of the poor   
and turn aside the way of the 
humble   
and a man and his father go unto 
the same maid   
to profane my holy name   2 amos  
860 
 8and they lay themselves down 
beside every altar  
upon clothes taken in pledge   
and in the house of their god they 
drink  
the wine of them that have been 
fined   
9yet destroyed i the a morite before 
them   
whose height was like the height of 
the cedars   
and he was strong as the oaks   
yet i destroyed his fruit from above   
and his roots from beneath   
10also i brought you up out of the 
land of egypt   
and led you forty years in the 
wilderness   
to possess the land of the amorites   
11and i raised up of your sons for 
prophets   
and of your young men for 
nazirites   
is it not even thus  o ye children of 
israel   
saith the lord  
12but ye gave the nazirites wine to 
drink   
and commanded the  prophets  
saying  prophesy not   
13behold  i will make it creak under 
you  
as a cart creaketh that is full of 
sheaves   
14and flight shall fail the swift   
and the strong shall not exert his 
strength   
neither shall the mighty deliver 
himself   15neith er shall he stand that 
handleth the bow   
and he that is swift of foot shall not 
deliver himself   
neither shall he that rideth the horse 
deliver himself   
16and he that is courageous among 
the mighty  
shall flee away naked in that day   
saith the lord  
 
hear this word that the lord hath 
spoken against you  o children of 
israel  against the whole family which 
i brought up out of the land of egypt  
saying   
2you only have i known of all the 
families of the earth   
therefore i will visit upon you all 
your iniquities   
 
3will two walk together   
except they have agreed   
4will a lion roar in the forest   
when he hath no prey   
will a young lion give forth his 
voice out of his den   
if he have taken nothing   
5will a bird fall in a snare upon the 
earth   
where there is no lure for it   
will a snare spring up from the 
ground   
and have taken nothing at all   
6shall the horn be blown in a city   
and the people not tremble   
shall evil befall a city   
and the lord hath not done it   
7for the lord g od will do noth ing  3 amos  
861 
 but he revealeth his counsel unto 
his servants the prophets   
8the lion hath roared   
who will not fear   
the lord g od hath spoken   
who can but prophesy   
 
9proclaim it upon the palaces at 
ashdod   
and upon the palaces in the land of 
egypt   
and say  assemble yourselves 
upon the mountains of samaria   
and behold the great confusions 
therein   
and the oppressions in the midst 
thereof   
10for they know not to do right  
saith the lord  
who store up violence and robbery 
in their palaces   
11therefore thus saith the lord g od  
an adversary  even round about the 
land  
and he shall bring down thy 
strength from thee   
and thy palaces shall be spoiled   
12thus saith the lord  
as the shepherd rescueth out of the 
mouth of the lion  
two legs  or a piece of a n ear   
so shall the children of israel that 
dwell in samaria  
escape with the corner of a couch  
and the leg of a bed   
 
13hear ye  and testify against the 
house of jacob   saith the lord g od the god of 
hosts   
14for in the day that i shall visit the 
transgressions of israel upon him   
i will also punish the altars of beth 
el  
and the horns of the altar shall be 
cut off   
and fall to the ground   
15and i will smite the winter house 
with the summer house   
and the houses of ivory shall perish   
and the gr eat houses shall have an 
end  
saith the lord  
 
hear this word  ye kine of 
bashan  that are in the mountain 
of samaria   
that oppress the poor  that crush the 
needy   
that say unto their lords  bring  
that we may feast   
2the lord g od hath sworn by hi s 
holiness   
lo surely the days shall come upon 
you  
that ye shall be taken away with 
hooks   
and your residue with fish hooks   
3and ye shall go out at the breaches  
every one straight before her   
and ye shall be cast into harmon   
saith the lord  
 
4come to beth el and transgress   
to gilgal  and multiply 
transgression   4 amos  
862 
 and bring your sacrifices in the 
morning   
and your tithes after three days   
5and offer a sacrifice of 
thanksgiving of that which is 
leavened   
and proclaim freewill offerings and 
publish them   
for so ye love to do  o ye children 
of israel   
saith the lord g od  
 
6and i also have given you  
cleanness of teeth in all your cities   
and want of bread in all your 
places   
yet have ye not returned unto me   
saith the lord  
 
7and i also h ave withholden the rain 
from you   
when there were yet three months 
to the harvest   
and i caused it to rain upon one 
city  
and caused it not to rain upon 
another city   
one piece was rained upon   
and the piece whereupon it rained 
not withered   
8so two or three cities wandered 
unto one city  
to drink water  and were not 
satisfied   
yet have ye not returned unto me   
saith the lord  
 
9i have smitten you with blasting 
and mildew   the multitude of your gardens and 
your vineyards  
and your fig trees and yo ur olive 
trees  
hath the palmer worm devoured   
yet have ye not returned unto me   
saith the lord  
 
10i have sent among you the 
pestilence in the way of egypt   
your young men have i slain with 
the sword   
and have carried away your horses   
and i have ma de the stench of your 
camp to come up even into your 
nostrils   
yet have ye not returned unto me   
saith the lord  
 
11i have overthrown some of you   
as god overthrew sodom and 
gomorrah   
and ye were as a brand plucked out 
of the burning   
yet have ye not  returned unto me   
saith the lord  
 
12therefore thus will i do unto thee  
o israel   
because i will do this unto thee   
prepare to meet thy god  o israel   
13for lo he that formeth the 
mountains  and createth the wind   
and declareth unto man what is h is 
thought   
that maketh the morning darkness   
and treadeth upon the high places 
of the earth   amos  
863 
 the lord the god of hosts  is his 
name   
 
hear ye this word which i take up 
for a lamentation over you  o 
house of israel   
2the virgin of israel is fallen   
she shall no more rise   
she is cast down upon her land   
there is none to raise her up   
3for thus saith the lord g od the city 
that went forth a thousand shall have a 
hundred left  and that which went forth 
a hundred shall have ten left  of the 
house o f israel   
 
4for thus saith the lord unto the 
house of israel   
seek ye me  and live   
5but seek not beth el  
nor enter into gilgal   
and pass not to beer sheba   
for gilgal shall surely go into 
captivity   
and beth el shall come to nought   
6seek the lord and live  
lest he break out like fire in the 
house of joseph   
and it devour  and there be none to 
quench it in bethel   
7ye who turn judgment to 
wormwood   
and cast righteousness to the 
ground   
8him that maketh the pleiades and 
orion   
and bringeth on  the shadow of 
death in the morning   
and darkeneth the day into night   that calleth for the waters of the 
sea  
and poureth them out upon the face 
of the earth   
the lord is his name  
9that causeth destruction to flash 
upon the strong   
so that destructi on cometh upon the 
fortress   
 
10they hate him that reproveth in 
the gate   
and they abhor him that speaketh 
uprightly   
11therefore  because ye trample 
upon the poor   
and take from him exactions of 
wheat   
ye have built houses of hewn stone   
but ye shal l not dwell in them   
ye have planted pleasant vineyards   
but ye shall not drink wine thereof   
12for i know how manifold are your 
transgressions   
and how mighty are your sins   
ye that afflict the just  that take a 
ransom   
and that turn aside the needy  in the 
gate  
13therefore the prudent doth keep 
silence in such a time   
for it is an evil time   
 
14seek good  and not evil  that ye 
may live   
and so the lord the god of hosts  
will be with you  as ye say   
15hate the evil  and love the good   
and esta blish justice in the gate   5 amos  
864 
 it may be that the lord the god of 
hosts   
will be gracious unto the remnant of 
joseph   
 
16therefore thus saith the lord  
the god of hosts  the lord   
lamentation shall be in all the broad 
places   
and they shall say in all t he streets  
alas alas   
and they shall call the husbandman 
to mourning   
and proclaim lamentation to such as 
are skilful of wailing   
17and in all vineyards shall be 
lamentation   
for i will pass through the midst of 
thee  
saith the lord  
 
18woe unto  you that desire the day 
of the lord  
wherefore would ye have the day of 
the lord  
it is darkness  and not light   
19as if a man did flee from a lion   
and a bear met him   
and went into the house and leaned 
his hand on the wall   
and a serpent bit him   
20shall not the day of the lord be 
darkness  and not light   
even very dark  and no brightness in 
it  
21i hate  i despise your feasts   
and i will take no delight in your 
solemn assemblies   22yea though ye offer me burnt 
offerings and your meal 
offerin gs  
i will not accept them   
neither will i regard the peace 
offerings of your fat beasts   
23take thou away from me the noise 
of thy songs   
and let me not hear the melody of 
thy psalteries   
24but let justice well up as waters   
and righteousness as a m ighty 
stream   
25did ye bring unto me sacrifices and 
offerings in the wilderness forty years  
o house of israel  26so shall ye take 
up siccuth your king and chiun your 
images  the star of your god  which ye 
made to yourselves  27therefore will i 
cause you to go into captivity beyond 
damascus  saith he  whose name is 
the lord god of hosts   
 
woe to them that are at ease in 
 zion   
and to them that are secure in the 
 mountain of samaria   
the notable men of the first of the 
nations   
to whom the house of is rael come   
2pass ye unto calneh  and see   
and from thence go ye to hamath 
the great   
then go down to gath of the 
philistines   
are they better than these 
kingdoms   
or is their border greater than your 
border   6 amos  
865 
 3ye that put far away the evil day   
and cause the seat of violence to 
come near   
4that lie upon beds of ivory   
and stretch themselves upon their 
couches   
and eat the lambs out of the flock   
and the calves out of the midst of 
the stall   
5that thrum on the psaltery   
that devise for themselves  
instruments of music  like david   
6that drink wine in bowls   
and anoint themselves with the 
chief ointments   
but they are not grieved for the hurt 
of joseph   
7therefore now shall they go 
captive at the head of them that 
go captive   
and the revelry of  them that 
stretched themselves shall pass 
away   
8the lord g od hath sworn by 
himself   
saith the lord the god of hosts   
i abhor the pride of jacob   
and hate his palaces   
and i will deliver up the city with 
all that is therein   
9and it shall come to p ass if there 
remain ten men in one house  that they 
shall die  10and when a man s uncle 
shall take him up  even he that burneth 
him to bring out the bones out of the 
house  and shall say unto him that is in 
the innermost parts of the house  is 
there yet  any with thee  and he shall 
say no then shall he say  hold thy peace  for we must not make mention 
of the name of the lord  
 
11for behold  the lord 
commandeth   
and the great house shall be smitten 
into splinters   
and the little house into chips   
12do horses run upon the rocks   
doth one plow there with oxen   
that ye have turned justice into gall   
and the fruit of righteousness into 
wormwood   
13ye that rejoice in a thing of 
nought   
that say  have we not taken to us 
horns by our own strength   
14for behold  i will raise up against 
you a nation  o house of israel  saith 
the lord the god of hosts  and they 
shall afflict you from the entrance of 
hamath unto the brook of the arabah   
 
thus the lord g od showed me  
and behold  he formed locus ts in 
the beginning of the shooting up of the 
latter growth  and lo it was the latter 
growth after the king s mowings  2and 
if it had come to pass  that when they 
had made an end of eating the grass of 
the land so i said   
o lord g od forgive  i beseech 
thee   
how shall jacob stand  for he is 
small   
3the lord repented concerning this  it 
shall not be  saith the lord  
 7 amos  
866 
 4thus the lord g od showed me  
and behold  the lord g od called to 
contend by fire  and it devoured the 
great deep  and would have eaten  up 
the land  5then said i   
o lord g od cease  i beseech thee   
how shall jacob stand  for he is 
small   
6the lord repented concerning this  
this also shall not be  saith the lord 
god  
 
7thus he showed me  and behold  
the lord stood beside a wall made  by a 
plumbline  with a plumbline in his 
hand  8and the lord said unto me  
amos  what seest thou  and i said  
a plumbline  then said the lord   
behold  i will set a plumbline in the 
midst of my people israel   
i will not again pardon them any 
more   
9and the high places of isaac shall 
be desolate   
and the sanctuaries of israel shall 
be laid waste   
and i will rise against the house of 
jeroboam with the sword   
 
 10then amaziah the priest of beth 
el sent to jeroboam king of israel  
saying  amos hath co nspired against 
thee in the midst of the house of israel  
the land is not able to bear all his 
words  11for thus amos saith   
jeroboam shall die by the sword   
and israel shall surely be led away 
captive out of his land   12also amaziah said unto amos  o 
thou seer  go flee thee away into the 
land of judah  and there eat bread  and 
prophesy there  13but prophesy not 
again any more at beth el for it is the 
kings sanctuary  and it is a royal 
house  14then answered amos  and 
said to amaziah  i was no pro phet 
neither was i a prophet s son  but i 
was a herdman  and a dresser of 
sycamore trees  15and the lord took 
me from following the flock  and the 
lord said unto me  go prophesy unto 
my people israel  16now therefore hear 
thou the word of the lord  
thou  sayest  prophesy not against 
israel   
and preach not against the house of 
isaac   
17therefore thus saith the lord  
thy wife shall be a harlot in the 
city  
and thy sons and thy daughters 
shall fall by the sword   
and thy land shall be divided by 
line  
and thou thyself shalt die in an 
unclean land   
and israel shall surely be led away 
captive out of his land   
 
thus the lord g od showed me  
and behold a basket of summer 
fruit 2and he said  amos  what seest 
thou and i said  a basket of 
asummer fruit  then said the lord 
unto me   
                                                      
a heb kaiz 8 amos  
867 
 the aend is come upon my people 
israel   
i will not again pardon them any 
more   
3and the songs of the palace shall 
be wailings in that day   
saith the lord g od  
the dead bodies shall be many   
in every place silence shall be cast   
 
4hear this  o ye that would swallow 
the needy   
and destroy the poor of the land   
5saying  when will the new moon 
be gone  that we may sell grain   
and the sabbath  that we may set 
forth corn   
making the ephah small  and the 
shekel great   
and falsifying the balances of 
deceit   
6that we may buy the poor for 
silver   
and the needy for a pair of shoes   
and sell the refuse of the corn   
7the lord hath sworn by the pride 
of jacob   
surely i will never forget any of 
their works   
8shall not the land tremble for this   
and every one mourn that dwelleth 
therein   
yea it shall rise up wholly like the 
river   
and it shall be troubled and sink 
again  like the river of egypt   
                                                      
a heb kez  9and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
saith the lord g od  
that i will c ause the sun to go down 
at noon   
and i will darken the earth in the 
clear day   
10and i will turn your feasts into 
mourning   
and all your songs into lamentation   
and i will bring up sackcloth upon 
all loins   
and baldness upon every head   
and i will ma ke it as the mourning 
for an only son   
and the end thereof as a bitter day   
 
11behold  the days come  saith the 
lord g od  
that i will send a famine in the 
land  
not a famine of bread  nor a thirst 
for water   
but of hearing the words of the 
lord  
12and they shall wander from sea to 
sea  
and from the north even to the east   
they shall run to and fro to seek the 
word of the lord  
and shall not find it   
13in that day shall the fair virgins  
and the young men faint for thirst   
14they that swear by the  sin of 
samaria   
and say  as thy god  o dan  
liveth   
and as the way of beer sheba 
liveth   amos  
868 
 even they shall fall  and never rise 
up again   
 
i saw the lord standing beside the 
altar and he said   
smite the capitals  that the posts 
may shake   
and break them in pieces on the 
head of all of them   
and i will slay the residue of them 
with the sword   
there shall not one of them flee 
away   
and there shall not one of them 
escape   
2though they dig into the nether 
world   
thence shall my hand take them   
and though they climb up to 
heaven   
thence will i bring them down   
3and though they hide themselves 
in the top of carmel   
i will search and take them out 
thence   
and though they be hid from my 
sight in the bottom of the sea   
thence will i command th e serpent  
and he shall bite them   
4and though they go into captivity 
before their enemies   
thence will i command the sword  
and it shall slay them   
and i will set mine eyes upon them  
for evil  and not for good   
 
5for the lord  the g od of hosts   
is he that toucheth the land and it 
melteth   and all that dwell therein mourn   
and it riseth up wholly like the 
river   
and sinketh again  like the river of 
egypt   
6it is he that buildeth his upper 
chambers in the heaven   
and hath founded his vault upon 
the earth   
he that calleth for the waters of the 
sea  
and poureth them out upon the face 
of the earth   
the lord is his name   
7are ye not as the children of the 
ethiopians unto me   
o children of israel  saith the lord  
have not i brought up israel out o f 
the land of egypt   
and the philistines from caphtor   
and aram from kir   
8behold  the eyes of the lord g od  
are upon the sinful kingdom   
and i will destroy it from off the 
face of the earth   
saving that i will not utterly destroy 
the house of jacob   
saith the lord  
9for lo i will command  and i will 
sift the house of israel among all 
the nations   
like as corn is sifted in a sieve   
yet shall not the least grain fall 
upon the earth   
10all the sinners of my people shall 
die by the sword   
that say  the evil shall not 
overtake nor confront us   
 9 amos  
869 
 11in that day will i raise up  
the tabernacle of david that is 
fallen   
and close up the breaches thereof   
and i will raise up his ruins   
and i will build it as in the days of 
old  
12that they may posse ss the remnant 
of edom   
and all the nations  upon whom my 
name is called   
saith the lord that doeth this   
 
13behold  the days come  saith the 
lord  
that the plowman shall overtake the 
reaper   
and the treader of grapes him that 
soweth seed   and the mo untains shall drop sweet 
wine   
and all the hills shall melt   
14and i will turn the captivity of my 
people israel   
and they shall build the waste 
cities  and inhabit them   
and they shall plant vineyards  and 
drink the wine thereof   
they shall also make  gardens  and 
eat the fruit of them   
15and i will plant them upon their 
land  
and they shall no more be plucked 
up  
out of their land which i have given 
them   
saith the lord thy god  
 
 
  
obadiah  
 
the vision  of obadiah   
 
thus saith the lord g od concerning 
edom   
we have heard a message from the 
lord  
and an ambassador is sent among 
the nations   
arise ye  and let us rise up against 
her in battle   
2behold  i make thee small among 
the nations   
thou art greatly despised   3the pride of thy hear t hath beguiled 
thee  
o thou that dwellest in the clefts of 
the rock   
thy habitation on high   
that sayest in thy heart   
who shall bring me down to the 
ground   
4though thou make thy nest as high 
as the eagle   
and though thou set it among the 
stars  1 obadiah  
870 
 i will bring thee down from thence  
saith the lord  
5if thieves came to thee  if robbers 
by night  
how art thou cut off  
would they not steal till they had 
enough   
if grape gatherers came to thee   
would they not leave some gleaning 
grapes   
6how is es au searched out   
how are his hidden places sought 
out  
7all the men of thy confederacy  
have conducted thee to the border   
the men that were at peace with 
thee  
have beguiled thee  and prevailed 
against thee   
they that eat thy bread lay a snare 
under t hee  
in whom there is no discernment   
8shall i not in that day  saith the 
lord  
destroy the wise men out of edom   
and discernment out of the mount 
of esau   
9and thy mighty men  o teman  
shall be dismayed   
to the end that every one may be 
cut off from  the mount of esau by 
slaughter   
10for the violence done to thy 
brother jacob shame shall cover 
thee  
and thou shalt be cut off for ever   
11in the day that thou didst stand 
aloof   in the day that strangers carried 
away his substance    
and foreigners e ntered into his 
gates   
and cast lots upon jerusalem   
even thou wast as one of them   
12but thou shouldest not have gazed 
on the day of thy brother  
in the day of his disaster   
neither shouldest thou have rejoiced 
over the children of judah  
in the day o f their destruction   
neither shouldest thou have spoken 
proudly  
in the day of distress   
13thou shouldest not have entered 
into the gate of my people  
in the day of their calamity   
yea thou shouldest not have gazed 
on their affliction  
in the day of th eir calamity   
nor have laid hands on their 
substance  
in the day of their calamity   
14neither shouldest thou have stood 
in the crossway   
to cut off those of his that escape   
neither shouldest thou have 
delivered up those of his  
that did remain in the day of 
distress   
 
15for the day of the lord is near 
upon all the nations   
as thou hast done  it shall be done 
unto thee   
thy dealing shall return upon thine 
own head   obadiah  
871 
 16for as ye have drunk upon my 
holy mountain   
so shall all the nations drink 
continu ally  
yea they shall drink  and swallow 
down   
and shall be as though they had not 
been   
17but in mount zion there shall be 
those that escape   
and it shall be holy   
and the house of jacob shall 
possess their possessions   
18and the house of jacob shal l be a 
fire  
and the house of joseph a flame   
and the house of esau for stubble   
and they shall kindle in them  and 
devour them   
and there shall not be any 
remaining of the house of esau   for the lord hath spoken   
19and they of the south shall 
posses s the mount of esau   
and they of the lowland the 
philistines   
and they shall possess the field of 
ephraim   
and the field of samaria   
and benjamin shall possess gilead   
20and the captivity of this host of 
the children of israel   
that are among the can aanites  
even unto zarephath   
and the captivity of jerusalem  that 
is in sepharad   
shall possess the cities of the south   
21and saviours shall come up on 
mount zion  
to judge the mount of esau   
and the kingdom shall be the 
lords 
 
 
 
jonah  
 
now the word  of the lord came 
unto jonah the son of amittai  
saying  2arise  go to nineveh  that 
great city  and proclaim against it  for 
their wickedness is come up before 
me 3but jonah rose up to flee unto 
tarshish from the presence of the 
lord and he went down to joppa  and 
found a ship going to tarshish  so he 
paid the fare thereof  and went down into it  to go with them unto tarshish  
from the presence of the lord  
4but the lord hurled a great wind 
into the sea  and there was a migh ty 
tempest in the sea  so that the ship was 
like to be broken  5and the mariners 
were afraid  and cried every man unto 
his god  and they cast forth the wares 
that were in the ship into the sea  to 
lighten it unto them  but jonah was 
gone down into the inne rmost parts of 1 jonah  
872 
 the ship  and he lay  and was fast 
asleep  6so the shipmaster came to 
him and said unto him  what 
meanest thou that thou sleepest  arise  
call upon thy god  if so be that god 
will think upon us  that we perish not   
7and they said every o ne to his 
fellow  come  and let us cast lots  that 
we may know for whose cause this 
evil is upon us  so they cast lots  and 
the lot fell upon jonah  8then said they 
unto him  tell us  we pray thee  for 
whose cause this evil is upon us  what 
is thine occ upation  and whence 
comest thou  what is thy country  and 
of what people art thou  9and he said 
unto them  i am an hebrew  and i fear 
the lord the god of heaven  who hath 
made the sea and the dry land  10then 
were the men exceedingly afraid  and 
said u nto him  what is this that thou 
hast done  for the men knew that he 
fled from the presence of the lord 
because he had told them   
11then said they unto him  what 
shall we do unto thee  that the sea may 
be calm unto us  for the sea grew 
more and more t empestuous  12and he 
said unto them  take me up  and cast 
me forth into the sea  so shall the sea 
be calm unto you  for i know that for 
my sake this great tempest is upon 
you 13nevertheless the men rowed 
hard to bring it to the land  but they 
could not  for the sea grew more and 
more tempestuous against them  
14wherefore they cried unto the lord 
and said  we beseech thee  o lord 
we beseech thee  let us not perish for this man s life  and lay not upon us 
innocent blood  for thou  o lord hast 
done as i t pleased thee  15so they 
took up jonah  and cast him forth into 
the sea  and the sea ceased from its 
raging  16then the men feared the lord 
exceedingly  and they offered a 
sacrifice unto the lord and made 
vows   
and the lord prepared a great 
fish to s wallow up jonah  and 
jonah was in the belly of the fish three 
days and three nights  2then jonah 
prayed unto the lord his god out of 
the fish s belly  3and he said   
i called out of mine affliction  
unto the lord and he answered 
me  
out of the belly of t he nether world 
cried i   
and thou heardest my voice   
4for thou didst cast me into the 
depth   
in the heart of the seas   
and the flood was round about me   
all thy waves and thy billows  
passed over me   
5and i said  i am cast out  
from before thine eye s  
yet i will look again  
toward thy holy temple   
6the waters compassed me about  
even to the soul   
the deep was round about me   
the weeds were wrapped about my 
head   
7i went down to the bottoms of the 
mountains   2 jonah  
873 
 the earth with her bars closed upon 
me for ever   
yet hast thou brought up my life 
from the pit   
o lord my god   
8when my soul fainted within me   
i remembered the lord  
and my prayer came in unto thee   
into thy holy temple   
9they that regard lying vanities  
forsake their own mercy   
10but i will sacrifice unto thee  
with the voice of thanksgiving   
that which i have vowed i will pay   
salvation is of the lord  
11and the lord spoke unto the fish  
and it vomited out jonah upon the dry 
land  
and the word of the lord came 
unto jonah the second time  
saying  2arise  go unto nineveh  that 
great city  and make unto it the 
proclamation that i bid thee  3so 
jonah arose  and went unto nineveh  
according to the word of the lord 
now nineveh was an exceeding great 
city of three days journey  4and jonah 
began to enter into the city a day s 
journey  and he proclaimed  and said  
yet forty days  and nineveh shall be 
overthrown   
5and the people of nineveh 
believed god  and they proclaimed a 
fast and put on sackcloth  from the 
greatest of them ev en to the least of 
them  6and the tidings reached the 
king of nineveh  and he arose from his 
throne  and laid his robe from him  and 
covered him with sackcloth  and sat in ashes  7and he caused it to be 
proclaimed and published through 
nineveh by the decre e of the king and 
his nobles  saying  let neither man 
nor beast  herd nor flock  taste any 
thing  let them not feed  nor drink 
water  8but let them be covered with 
sackcloth  both man and beast  and let 
them cry mightily unto god  yea let 
them turn every  one from his evil way  
and from the violence that is in their 
hands  9who knoweth whether god 
will not turn and repent  and turn away 
from his fierce anger  that we perish 
not  
10and god saw their works  that 
they turned from their evil way  and 
god rep ented of the evil  which he 
said he would do unto them  and he  
did it not  1but it displeased jonah 
exceedingly  and he was angry  
2and he prayed unto the lord and 
said i pray thee  o lord was not 
this my saying  when i was yet in mine 
own country  therefore i fled 
beforehand unto tarshish  for i knew 
that thou art a gracious god  and 
compassionate  longsuffering  and 
abundant in mercy  and repentest thee 
of the evil  3therefore now  o lord 
take i beseech thee  my life from me  
for it is better fo r me to die than to 
live 4and the lord said art thou 
greatly angry   
5then jonah went out of the city  
and sat on the east side of the city  and 
there made him a booth  and sat under 
it in the shadow  till he might see what 
would become of the city  6and the 3 4 jonah  
874 
 lord god prepared a gourd  and made 
it to come up over jonah  that it might 
be a shadow over his head  to deliver 
him from his evil  so jonah was 
exceeding glad because of the gourd  
7but god prepared a worm when the 
morning rose the next day  and it 
smote the gourd  that it withered  8and 
it came to pass  when the sun arose  
that god prepared a vehement east 
wind  and the sun beat upon the head 
of jonah  that he fainted  and requested 
for himself that he might die  and said  
it is better for me to  die than to live  9and god said to jonah  art thou 
greatly angry for the gourd  and he 
said i am greatly angry  even unto 
death  10and the lord said thou 
hast had pity on the gourd  for which 
thou hast not laboured  neither madest 
it grow  which c ame up in a night  and 
perished in a night  11and should not i 
have pity on nineveh  that great city  
wherein are more than sixscore 
thousand persons that cannot discern 
between their right hand and their left 
hand  and also much cattle   
 
 
 
micah  
 
the word  of the lord that came 
to micah the morashtite in the 
days of jotham  ahaz  and hezekiah  
kings of judah  which he saw 
concerning samaria and jerusalem   
 
2hear  ye peoples  all of you   
hearken  o earth  and all that 
therein is   
and let the lord g od be witness 
against you   
the lord from his holy temple   
3for behold  the lord cometh forth 
out of his place   
and will come down  and tread 
upon the high places of the earth   
4and the mountains shall be molten 
under him   and the vall eys shall be cleft   
as wax before the fire   
as waters that are poured down a 
steep place   
 
5for the transgression of jacob is all 
this  
and for the sins of the house of 
israel   
what is the transgression of jacob  
is it not samaria   
and what are the h igh places of 
judah  are they not jerusalem   
 
6therefore i will make samaria a 
heap in the field   
a place for the planting of 
vineyards   1 micah  
875 
 and i will pour down the stones 
thereof into the valley   
and i will uncover the foundations 
thereof   
7and all her graven images shall be 
beaten to pieces   
and all her hires shall be burned 
with fire   
and all her idols will i lay desolate   
for of the hire of a harlot hath she 
gathered them   
and unto the hire of a harlot shall 
they return   
 
8for this will i wail an d howl   
i will go stripped and naked   
i will make a wailing like the 
jackals   
and a mourning like the ostriches   
9for her wound is incurable   
for it is come even unto judah   
it reacheth unto the gate of my 
people  even to jerusalem   
10tell it not in  gath   
weep not at all   
at beth leaphrah roll thyself in the 
dust  
11pass ye away  o inhabitant of 
saphir  in nakedness and shame   
the inhabitant of zaanan is not 
come forth   
the wailing of beth ezel shall take 
from you the standing place 
thereof   
12for the inhabitant of maroth 
waiteth anxiously for good   
because evil is come down from the 
lord unto the gate of jerusalem   13bind the chariots to the swift 
steeds  o inhabitant of lachish   
she was the beginning of sin to the 
daughter of zion   
for the transgressions of israel are 
found in thee   
14therefore shalt thou give a parting 
gift to moresheth gath  
the houses of achzib shall be a 
deceitful thing unto the kings of 
israel   
15i will yet bring unto thee  o 
inhabitant of mareshah  him that 
shall possess thee   
the glory of israel shall come even 
unto adullam   
16make thee bald  and poll thee for 
the children of thy delight   
enlarge thy baldness as the vulture   
for they are gone into captivity 
from thee   
 
woe to them that devise iniquity  
and work evil upon their beds   
when the morning is light  they 
execute it   
because it is in the power of their 
hand   
2and they covet fields  and seize 
them   
and houses  and take them away   
thus they oppress a man and his 
house   
even a man and his heritag e  
3therefore thus saith the lord  
behold  against this family do i 
devise an evil   
from which ye shall not remove 
your necks   2 micah  
876 
 neither shall ye walk upright  for it 
shall be an evil time   
4in that day shall they take up a 
parable against you   
and lam ent with a doleful 
lamentation  and say   
we are utterly ruined   
he changeth the portion of my 
people   
how doth he remove it from me   
instead of restoring our fields  he 
divideth them   
5therefore thou shalt have none that 
shall cast the line by lot  
in the congregation of the lord  
6preach ye not  they preach   
they shall not preach of these 
things   
that they shall not take shame   
7do i change  o house of jacob   
is the spirit of the lord straitened   
are these his doings   
do not my words do g ood to him 
that walketh uprightly   
 
8but of late my people is risen up as 
an enemy   
with the garment ye strip also the 
mantle  
from them that pass by securely  so 
that they are as men returning 
from war   
9the women of my people ye cast 
out from their pl easant houses   
from their young children ye take 
away my glory for ever   
10arise ye  and depart  for this is not 
your resting place   because of the uncleanness thereof  
it shall destroy you  even with a 
sore destruction   
 
11if a man walking in wind and  
falsehood do lie   
i will preach unto thee of wine and 
of strong drink   
he shall even be the preacher of this 
people   
 
12i will surely assemble  o jacob  all 
of thee   
i will surely gather the remnant of 
israel   
i will render them all as sheep in a 
fold  
as a flock in the midst of their 
pasture   
they shall make great noise by 
reason of the multitude of men   
13the breaker is gone up before 
them   
they have broken forth and passed 
on  
by the gate  and are gone out 
thereat   
and their king is passed on before 
them   
and the lord at the head of them   
 
and i said   
hear  i pray you  ye heads of 
jacob   
and rulers of the house of israel   
is it not for you to know justice   
2who hate the good  and love the 
evil  
who rob their skin from off them   3 micah  
877 
 and their flesh from off their bones   
3who also eat the flesh of my 
people   
and flay their skin from off them   
and break their bones   
yea they chop them in pieces  as 
that which is in the pot   
and as flesh within the caldron   
4then shall they cry unto the lord  
but he will not answer them   
yea he will hide his face from 
them at that time   
according as they have wrought 
evil in their doings   
 
5thus saith the lord concerning the 
prophets that make my people to 
err  
that cry  peace  when their teet h 
have any thing to bite   
and whoso putteth not into their 
mouths   
they even prepare war against him   
6therefore it shall be night unto 
you that ye shall have no vision   
and it shall be dark unto you  that 
ye shall not divine   
and the sun shall go do wn upon the 
prophets   
and the day shall be black over 
them   
7and the seers shall be put to shame  
and the diviners confounded   
yea they shall all cover their upper 
lips  
for there shall be no answer of god   
8but i truly am full of power by the 
spirit  of the lord  and of justice  and of might  to 
declare unto jacob his 
transgression   
and to israel his sin   
 
9hear this  i pray you  ye heads of 
the house of jacob   
and rulers of the house of israel   
that abhor justice  and pervert all 
equity   
10that build up zion with blood   
and jerusalem with iniquity   
11the heads thereof judge for 
reward   
and the priests thereof teach for 
hire  
and the prophets thereof divine for 
money   
yet will they lean upon the lord 
and say   
is not the lord in the midst of us   
no evil shall come upon us   
12therefore shall zion for your sake 
be plowed as a field   
and jerusalem shall become heaps   
and the mountain of the house as 
the high places of a forest   
 
but in the end of days it shall 
 come  to pass   
that the  mountain of the l ords 
house shall be established as the 
top of the mountains   
and it shall be exalted above the 
hills  
and peoples shall flow unto it   
2and many nations shall go and say   
come ye  and let us go up to the 
mountain of the lord  4 micah  
878 
 and to  the house of the god of 
jacob   
and he will teach us of his ways   
and we will walk in his paths   
for out of zion shall go forth the 
law  
and the word of the lord from 
jerusalem   
3and he shall judge between many 
peoples   
and shall decide concerning m ighty 
nations afar off   
and they shall beat their swords into 
plowshares   
and their spears into pruninghooks   
nation shall not lift up sword 
against nation   
neither shall they learn war any 
more   
4but they shall sit every man under 
his vine and under his fig tree  
and none shall make them afraid   
for the mouth of the lord of hosts 
hath spoken   
 
5for let all the peoples walk each 
one in the name of its god   
but we will walk in the name of the 
lord our god for ever and ever   
 
6in that day  saith the  lord will i 
assemble her that halteth   
and i will gather her that is driven 
away   
and her that i have afflicted   
7and i will make her that halted a 
remnant   
and her that was cast far off a 
mighty nation   and the lord shall reign over them 
in mount z ion from thenceforth 
even for ever   
 
8and thou  migdal eder the hill of 
the daughter of zion   
unto thee shall it come   
yea the former dominion shall 
come   
the kingdom of the daughter of 
jerusalem   
9now why dost thou cry out aloud  
is there no king i n thee   
is thy counsellor perished   
that pangs have taken hold of thee 
as of a woman in travail   
10be in pain  and labour to bring 
forth  o daughter of zion   
like a woman in travail   
for now shalt thou go forth out of 
the city   
and shalt dwell in the  field  
and shalt come even unto babylon   
there shalt thou be rescued   
there shall the lord redeem thee 
from the hand of thine enemies   
 
11and now many nations are 
assembled against thee   
that say  let her be defiled  and let 
our eye gaze upon zion   
12but they know not the thoughts of 
the lord  
neither understand they his 
counsel   
for he hath gathered them as the 
sheaves to the threshing floor   
13arise and thresh  o daughter of 
zion   micah  
879 
 for i will make thy horn iron   
and i will make thy hoofs bras s  
and thou shalt beat in pieces many 
peoples   
and thou shalt devote their gain 
unto the lord  
and their substance unto the lord of 
the whole earth   
 
14now shalt thou gather thyself in 
troops  o daughter of troops   
they have laid siege against us   
they smite the judge of israel with a 
rod upon the cheek   
 
but thou  beth lehem ephrathah  
which art little to be among the 
 thousands of judah   
out of thee shall one come forth 
unto me that is to be ruler in 
israel   
whose goings forth are from of old  
from ancient days   
2therefore will he give them up   
until the time that she who 
travaileth hath brought forth   
then the residue of his brethren 
shall return with the children of 
israel   
3and he shall stand  and shall feed 
his flock in the strength of t he 
lord  
in the majesty of the name of the 
lord his god   
and they shall abide  for then shall 
he be great unto the ends of the 
earth   
4and this shall be peace   when the assyrian shall come into 
our land   
and when he shall tread in our 
palaces   
then s hall we raise against him 
seven shepherds   
and eight princes among men   
5and they shall waste the land of 
assyria with the sword   
and the land of nimrod with the 
keen edged sword   
and he shall deliver us from the 
assyrian  when he cometh into 
our land   
and when he treadeth within our 
border   
 
6and the remnant of jacob shall be 
in the midst of many peoples   
as dew from the lord as showers 
upon the grass   
that are not looked for from man   
nor awaited at the hands of the sons 
of men   
7and the remnan t of jacob shall be 
among the nations  in the midst of 
many peoples   
as a lion among the beasts of the 
forest   
as a young lion among the flocks of 
sheep   
who if he go through  treadeth 
down and teareth in pieces   
and there is none to deliver   
8let th y hand be lifted up above 
thine adversaries   
and let all thine enemies be cut off   
 5 micah  
880 
 9and it shall come to pass in that 
day saith the lord  
that i will cut off thy horses out of 
the midst of thee   
and will destroy thy chariots   
10and i will cut off th e cities of thy 
land  
and will throw down all thy 
strongholds   
11and i will cut off witchcrafts out 
of thy hand   
and thou shalt have no more 
soothsayers   
12and i will cut off thy graven 
images and thy pillars out of the 
midst of thee   
and thou shalt n o more worship the 
work of thy hands   
13 and i will pluck up thy asherim 
out of the midst of thee   
and i will destroy thine enemies   
14and i will execute vengeance in 
anger and fury upon the nations   
because they hearkened not   
 
hear ye now what the  lord saith  
arise  contend thou before the 
 mountains   
and let the hills hear thy voice   
2hear  o ye mountains  the l ords 
controversy   
and ye enduring rocks  the 
foundations of the earth   
for the lord hath a controversy 
with his people   
and he will plead with israel   
3o my people  what have i done 
unto thee   
and wherein have i wearied thee   testify against me   
4for i brought thee up out of the 
land of egypt   
and redeemed thee out of the house 
of bondage   
and i sent before thee moses  
aaron  and miriam   
5o my people  remember now what 
balak king of moab devised   
and what balaam the son of beor 
answered him   
from shittim unto gilgal   
that ye may know the righteous acts 
of the lord  
6wherewith shall i come before the 
lord  
and bow myself bef ore god on 
high  
shall i come before him with burnt 
offerings   
with calves of a year old   
7will the lord be pleased with 
thousands of rams   
with ten thousands of rivers of oil   
shall i give my first born for my 
transgression   
the fruit of my body for  the sin of 
my soul   
8it hath been told thee  o man  what 
is good   
and what the lord doth require of 
thee  
only to do justly  and to love mercy  
and to walk humbly with thy 
god  
 
9hark  the lord crieth unto the 
city  6 micah  
881 
 and it is wisdom to have regard f or 
thy name   
hear ye the rod  and who hath 
appointed it   
10are there yet the treasures of 
wickedness in the house of the 
wicked   
and the scant measure that is 
abominable   
11shall i be pure with wicked 
balances   
and with a bag of deceitful 
weights   
12for the rich men thereof are full of 
violence   
and the inhabitants thereof have 
spoken lies   
and their tongue is deceitful in their 
mouth   
13therefore i also do smite thee with 
a grievous wound   
i do make thee desolate because of 
thy sins   
14thou sh alt eat  but not be satisfied   
and thy sickness shall be in thine 
inward parts   
and thou shalt conceive  but shalt 
not bring forth   
and whomsoever thou bringest 
forth will i give up to the sword   
15thou shalt sow  but shalt not reap   
thou shalt tread the olives  but shalt 
not anoint thee with oil   
and the vintage  but shalt not drink 
wine   
16for the statutes of omri are kept   
and all the works of the house of 
ahab   
and ye walk in their counsels   that i may make thee an 
astonishment   
and the inhab itants thereof a 
hissing   
and ye shall bear the reproach of 
my people   
 
woe is me  for i am as the last of 
 the summer fruits   
as the grape gleanings of the 
vintage   
there is no cluster to eat   
nor first ripe fig which my soul 
desireth   
2the godly man is perished out of 
the earth   
and the upright among men is no 
more   
they all lie in wait for blood   
they hunt every man his brother 
with a net   
3their hands are upon that which is 
evil to do it diligently   
the prince asketh  and the judge is 
ready  for a reward   
and the great man  he uttereth the 
evil desire of his soul   
thus they weave it together   
4the best of them is as a brier   
the most upright is worse than a 
thorn hedge   
the day of thy watchmen  even thy 
visitation  is come   
now shall be  their perplexity   
5trust ye not in a friend   
put ye not confidence in a familiar 
friend   
keep the doors of thy mouth from 
her that lieth in thy bosom   7 micah  
882 
 6for the son dishonoureth the father   
the daughter riseth up against her 
mother   
the daughter inlaw against her 
mother inlaw  
a mans enemies are the men of his 
own house   
 
7but as for me  i will look unto the 
lord  
i will wait for the god of my 
salvation   
my god will hear me   
8rejoice not against me  o mine 
enemy   
though i am fallen  i shall arise   
though i sit in darkness  the lord is 
a light unto me   
9i will bear the indignation of the 
lord  
because i have sinned against him   
until he plead my cause  and 
execute judgment for me   
he will bring me forth to the light   
and i shall behold h is 
righteousness   
10then mine enemy shall see it  and 
shame shall cover her   
who said unto me  where is the 
lord thy god   
mine eyes shall gaze upon her   
now shall she be trodden down as 
the mire of the streets   
11the day for building thy walls  
even  that day  shall be far 
removed   
12there shall be a day when they 
shall come unto thee   from assyria even to the cities of 
egypt   
and from egypt even to the river   
and from sea to sea  and from 
mountain to mountain   
13and the land shall be desolate f or 
them that dwell therein   
because of the fruit of their doings   
 
14tend thy people with thy staff  
the flock of thy heritage   
that dwell solitarily  as a forest in 
the midst of the fruitful field   
let them feed in bashan and gilead  
as in the days of  old  
15as in the days of thy coming forth 
out of the land of egypt  
will i show unto him marvellous 
things   
16the nations shall see and be put to 
shame for all their might   
they shall lay their hand upon their 
mouth   
their ears shall be deaf   
17they shall lick the dust like a 
serpent   
like crawling things of the earth 
they shall come trembling out of 
their close places   
they shall come with fear unto the 
lord our god   
and shall be afraid because of thee   
18who is a god like unto thee  that 
pardo neth the iniquity   
and passeth by the transgression of 
the remnant of his heritage   
he retaineth not his anger for ever   
because he delighteth in mercy   micah  
883 
 19he will again have compassion 
upon us   
he will subdue our iniquities   
and thou wilt cast all th eir sins into 
the depths of the sea   20thou wilt show faithfulness to 
jacob  mercy to abraham   
as thou hast sworn unto our fathers 
from the days of old

great in power

so that there is strife  and contention

not theirs   
7they are terrible and dreadful   their law and their majesty p roceed

8their horses also are swifter than 
leopards   
and are more fierce than the wolves 
of the desert   
and their horsemen spread 
themselves   
yea their horsemen come from far   
they fly as a vulture that hasteth to 
devour   
9they come  all of them for violence   
their faces are set eagerly as the 
east wind   
and they gather captives as the 
sand  
10and they scoff at kings   
and princes are a derision unto 
them   
they deride every stronghold   
for they heap up earth  and take it   
11then  their spirit doth pass over 
and transgress   
and they become guilty   
even they who impute their might 
unto their god   
 
12art not thou from everlasting   
o lord my god  my holy one   
we shall not die   
o lord thou hast ordained them

behold evil   
and that canst not look on mischief   
wherefore lookest thou  when they 
deal treacherously   
and holdest thy peace  when the 
wicked swalloweth up  
the man  that is more righteous than 
he  
14and makest men as the fishes of 
the sea   
as the creeping things  that have no 
ruler over them   
15they take up all of them with the 
angle   
they catch them in their net   
and gather them in their drag   
therefore they r ejoice and exult   
16therefore they sacrifice unto their 
net  
and offer unto their drag   
because by them their portion is fat   
and their food plenteous   
17shall they therefore empty their 
net  
and not spare to slay the nations 
continually   
 
i will stand upon my watch   
and set me upon the tower   
and will look out to see what he 
will speak by me   
and what i shall answer when i am 
reproved   
2and the lord answered me  and 
said  
write the vision  and make it plain 
upon tables   
that a man may read it swiftly   3for the vision is yet for the 
appointed time   
and it declareth of the end  and doth 
not lie   
though it tarry  wait for it   
because it will surely come  it will 
not delay   
 
4behold  his soul is puffed up  it is 
not upright in him   
but the righteous shall live by his 
faith  
5yea moreover  wine is a 
treacherous dealer   
the haughty man abideth not   
he who enlargeth his desire as the 
nether world   
and is as death  and cannot be 
satisfied   
but gathereth unto him all nations   
and heapeth  unto him all peoples   
6shall not all these take up a parable 
against him   
and a taunting riddle against him   
and say  woe to him that 
increaseth that which is not his   
how long  and that ladeth himself 
with many pledges    
7shall they not rise up su ddenly that 
shall exact interest of thee   
and awake that shall violently 
shake thee   
and thou shalt be for booties unto 
them   
8because thou hast spoiled many 
nations   
all the remnant of the peoples shall 
spoil thee   2 habakkuk  
889 
 because of men s blood  and for the  
violence done to the land   
to the city and to all that dwell 
therein   
 
9woe to him that gaineth evil gains 
for his house   
that he may set his nest on high   
that he may be delivered from the 
power of evil   
10thou hast devised shame to thy 
house   
by cutting off many peoples   
and hast forfeited thy life   
11for the stone shall cry out of the 
wall  
and the beam out of the timber shall 
answer it   
 
12woe to him that buildeth a town 
with blood   
and establisheth a city by iniquity   
13behold  is it not o f the lord of 
hosts  
that the peoples labour for the fire   
and the nations weary themselves 
for vanity   
14for the earth shall be filled  
with the knowledge of the glory of 
the lord  
as the waters cover the sea   
 
15woe unto him that giveth his 
neighbour  drink   
that puttest thy venom thereto  and 
makest him drunken also   
that thou mayest look on their 
nakedness   16thou art filled with shame instead 
of glory   
drink thou also  and be uncovered   
the cup of the l ords right hand 
shall be turned unto thee   
and filthiness shall be upon thy 
glory   
17for the violence done to lebanon 
shall cover thee   
and the destruction of the beasts  
which made them afraid   
because of men s blood  and for the 
violence done to the land   
to the city and to all that dwell 
therein   
 
18what profiteth the graven image   
that the maker thereof hath graven 
it  
even the molten image  and the 
teacher of lies   
that the maker of his work trusteth 
therein   
to make dumb idols   
19woe unto him that saith to the 
wood  awake   
to the dumb stone  arise    
can this teach   
behold  it is overlaid with gold and 
silver   
and there is no breath at all in the 
midst of it   
20but the lord is in his holy temple   
let all the earth keep silence before 
him

 2o lord i have heard the report of 
thee  and am afraid   
o lord revive thy work in the 
midst of the years   
in the midst of the years make it 
known   
in wrath remember compassion   
3god cometh from teman   
and the holy one from mou nt

his glory covereth the heavens   
and the earth is full of his praise   
4and a brightness appeareth as the 
light  
rays hath he at his side   
and there is the hiding of his 
power   
5before him goeth the pestilence   
and fiery bolts go forth at his feet   
6he standeth  and shaketh the earth   
he beholdeth  and maketh the 
nations to tremble   
and the everlasting mountains are 
dashed in pieces   
the ancient hills do bow   
his goings are as of old   
7i see the tents of cushan in 
afflicti on  
the curtains of the land of midian 
do tremble   
8is it o lord that against the rivers   
is it that thine anger is kindled 
against the rivers   
or thy wrath against the sea   
that thou dost ride upon thy 
horses   
upon thy chariots of victory   
9thy b ow is made quite bare   
sworn are the rods of the word   selah   
thou dost cleave the earth with 
rivers   
10the mountains have seen thee  
and they tremble   
the tempest of waters floweth over  
the deep uttereth its voice   
and lifteth up its hands on high   
11the sun and moon stand still in 
their habitation   
at the light of thine arrows as they 
go  
at the shining of thy glittering 
spear   
12thou marchest through the earth in 
indignation   
thou threshest the nations in anger   
13thou art come forth for the  
deliverance of thy people   
for the deliverance of thine 
anointed   
thou woundest the head out of the 
house of the wicked   
uncovering the foundation even  
unto the neck                            selah   
14thou hast stricken through with 
his own rods the head of his 
rulers   
that come as a whirlwind to scatter 
me  
whose rejoicing is as to devour the 
poor secretly   
15thou hast trodden the sea with 
thy horses   
the foaming of mighty waters   
16when i heard  mine inward parts 
trembled   
my lips quivered at the voice   
rottenness entereth into my bones   habakkuk  
891 
 and i tremble where i stand   
that i should wait for the day of 
trouble   
when he cometh up against the 
people that he invadeth   
17for though the fig tree shall not 
blossom   
neither shall fruit be in the vi nes  
the labour of the olive shall fail   
and the fields shall yield no food   
the flock shall be cut off from the 
fold  and there shall be no herd in the 
stalls   
18yet i will rejoice in the lord  
i will exult in the god of my 
salvation   
19god the lo rd is my strength   
and he maketh my feet like

the son of gedaliah  the son of 
amariah  the son of hezekiah  in the 
days of josiah the son of amon  king 
of judah   
 
2i will utterly consume all things 
from off the face of the earth   
saith the lord  
3i will consume man and beast   
i will consume the fowls of the 
heaven  and the fishes of the sea   
and the stumblingblocks with the 
wicked   
and i will cut off man from off the 
face of the earth   
saith the lord  4and i wi ll stretch out my hand 
upon judah   
and upon all the inhabitants of 
jerusalem   
and i will cut off the remnant of 
baal from this place   
and the name of the idolatrous 
priests with the priests   
5and them that worship the host of 
heaven upon the housetops   
and them that worship  that swear 
to the lord  
and swear by malcam   
6them also that are turned back 
from following the lord  
and those that have not sought the 
lord nor inquired after him

 7hold thy peace at the presence of 
the lord g od  
for the da y of the lord is at hand   
for the lord hath prepared a 
sacrifice   
he hath consecrated his guests   
8and it shall come to pass in the day 
of the l ords sacrifice   
that i will punish the princes  and 
the king s sons   
and all such as are clothed with 
foreign apparel   
9in the same day also will i punish 
all those that leap over the 
threshold   
that fill their master s house with 
violence and deceit   
 
10and in that day  saith the lord 
hark  a cry from the fish gate   
and a wailing from the second 
quarter   
and a great crashing from the hills   
11wail  ye inhabitants of maktesh   
for all the merchant people are 
undone   
all they that were laden with silver 
are cut off   
12and it shall come to pass at that 
time  
that i will search jerusalem with 
lamps   
and i will punish the men that are 
settled on their lees   
that say in their heart   
the lord will not do good  neither 
will he do evil   
13therefore their wealth shall 
become a booty   and their houses a desolation   
yea they shall build houses  but 
shall  not inhabit them   
and they shall plant vineyards  but 
shall not drink the wine thereof   
14the great day of the lord is near   
it is near and hasteth greatly   
even the voice of the day of the 
lord  
wherein the mighty man crieth 
bitterly   
15that day is  a day of wrath   
a day of trouble and distress   
a day of wasteness and desolation   
a day of darkness and gloominess   
a day of clouds and thick darkness   
16a day of the horn and alarm   
against the fortified cities  and 
against the high towers   
17and i will bring distress upon 
men  
that they shall walk like the blind   
because they have sinned against 
the lord  
and their blood shall be poured out 
as dust   
and their flesh as dung   
18neither their silver nor their gold  
shall be able to deliver them  
in the day of the l ords wrath   
but the whole earth shall be 
devoured by the fire of his 
jealousy   
for he will make and end  yea a 
terrible end   
of all them that dwell in the earth   
 
gather yourselves together  yea 
 gather together   2 zephaniah

5woe unto the inh abitants of the

the nation of the cherethites   
the word of the lord is against you   
o canaan  the land of the 
philistines   
i will even destroy thee  that there 
shall be no inhabitant   
6and the sea coast shall be pastures   
even meadows for shepherds  and

7and it shall be a portion for the 
remnant of the house of judah   
whereon they shall feed   
in the houses of ashkelon shall they 
lie down in the evening   
for the lord their god will 
remember them   
and turn their captivi ty  
 8i have heard the taunt of moab   
and the revilings of the children of 
ammon   
wherewith they have taunted my 
people   
and spoken boastfully concerning 
their border   
9therefore as i live   
saith the lord of hosts  the god of 
israel   
surely moab sha ll be as sodom   
and the children of ammon as 
gomorrah   
even the breeding place of nettles  
and saltpits   
and a desolation  for ever   
the residue of my people shall spoil 
them   
and the remnant of my nation shall 
inherit them   
10this shall they have fo r their pride   
because they have taunted and 
spoken boastfully  
against the people of the lord of 
hosts   
11the lord will be terrible unto 
them   
for he will famish all the gods of 
the earth   
then shall all the isles of the nations 
worship him   
every on e from its place   
12ye ethiopians also   
ye shall be slain by my sword   
 
13and he will stretch out his hand 
against the north   
and destroy assyria   zephaniah  
894 
 and will make nineveh a 
desolation   
and dry like the wilderness   
14and all beasts of every kind  
shall lie down in the midst of her in 
herds   
both the pelican and the bittern  
shall lodge in the capitals thereof   
voices shall sing in the windows   
desolation shall be in the posts   
for the cedar work thereof shall be 
uncovered   
15this is the joyous city   
that dwelt without care   
that said in her heart   
i am and there is none else beside 
me  
how is she become a desolation   
a place for beasts to lie down in   
every one that passeth by her  
shall hiss  and wag his hand   
 
woe to her that is filthy and 
 polluted   
to the oppressing city   
2she hearkened not the voice   
she received not correction   
she trusted not in the lord  
she drew not near to her god   
3her princes in the midst of her are 
roaring lions   
her judges are wolves of the desert   
they leave not a bone for the 
morrow   
4her prophets are wanton  
and treacherous persons   
her priests have profaned that 
which is holy   
they have done violence to the law   5the lord who is righteous is in the 
midst of her   
he will not do unrighteousness   
every morning doth he bring his 
right to light   
it faileth not   
but the unrighteous knoweth no 
shame   
6i have cut off nations   
their corners are desolate   
i have made their streets waste   
so that none passeth by   
their cities are destroyed  so tha t 
there is no man   
so that there is no inhabitant   
7i said  surely thou wilt fear me   
thou wilt receive correction   
so her dwelling shall not be cut off   
despite all that i have visited upon 
her  
but they betimes corrupted all their 
doings   
 
8ther efore wait ye for me  saith the 
lord  
until the day that i rise up to the 
prey  
for my determination is to gather 
the nations   
that i may assemble the kingdoms   
to pour upon them mine 
indignation   
even all my fierce anger   
for all the earth shall be devoured  
with the fire of my jealousy   
9for then will i turn to the peoples  
a pure language   
that they may all call upon the 
name of the lord  3 zephaniah

 to serve him with one consent   
10from beyond the rivers of ethiopia  
shall they bring my suppliants   
even the daughter of my dispersed   
as mine offering   
11in that day shalt thou not be 
ashamed for all thy doings   
wherein thou hast transgressed 
against me   
for then i will take away out of the 
midst of thee  
thy proudly exulting ones   
and thou shalt no mor e be haughty  
in my holy mountain   
12and i will leave in the midst of 
thee  
an afflicted and poor people   
and they shall take refuge in the 
name of the lord  
13the remnant of israel shall not do 
iniquity   
nor speak lies   
neither shall a deceitful tong ue be 
found in their mouth   
for they shall feed and lie down   
and none shall make them afraid   
 
14sing o daughter of zion   
shout o israel   
be glad and rejoice with all the 
heart   
o daughter of jerusalem   
15the lord hath taken away thy 
judgments   
he hath cast out thine enemy   the king of israel  even the lord is 
in the midst of thee   
thou shalt not fear evil any more   
16in that day it shall be said to 
jerusalem   
fear thou not   
o zion  let not thy hands be slack   
17the lord thy god is in the  midst 
of thee   
a mighty one who will save   
he will rejoice over thee with joy   
he will be silent in his love   
he will joy over thee with singing   
18i will gather them that are far from 
the appointed season  who are of 
thee  
that hast borne the burd en of 
reproach   
19behold  at that time  
i will deal with all them that afflict 
thee  
and i will save her that is lame   
and gather her that was driven 
away   
and i will make them to be a praise 
and a name   
whose shame hath been in all the 
earth   
20at that time will i bring you in   
and at that time will i gather you   
for i will make you to be a name

haggai  
 
in the second year of darius the 
king in the sixth month  in the 
first day of the month  came the word 
of the lord by haggai the prophet 
unto zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  
governor of judah  and to joshua the 
son of jehozadak  the high p riest 
saying  2thus speaketh the lord of 
hosts  saying  this people say  the 
time is not come  the time that the 
lords house should be built  3then 
came the word of the lord by haggai 
the prophet  saying  4is it a time for 
you yourselves to dwell in y our cieled 
houses  while this house lieth waste  
5now therefore thus saith the lord of 
hosts   
consider your ways   
6ye have sown much  and brought 
in little   
ye eat but ye have not enough   
ye drink  but ye are not filled with 
drink   
ye clothe you  but there is none 
warm   
and he that earneth wages earneth 
wages  
for a bag with holes   
7thus saith the lord of hosts  
consider your ways  8go up to the hill 
country  and bring wood  and build the 
house  and i will take pleasure in it  
and i will be glorifie d saith the lord 
9ye looked for much  and lo it came to little  and when ye brought it home  
i did blow upon it  why  saith the 
lord of hosts  because of my house 
that lieth waste  while ye run every 
man for his own house  10therefore 
over you the heav en hath kept back  so 
that there is no dew  and the earth hath 
kept back her produce  11and i called 
for a drought upon the land  and upon 
the mountains  and upon the corn  and 
upon the wine  and upon the oil  and 
upon that which the ground bringeth 
forth  and upon men  and upon cattle  
and upon all the labour of the hands   
12then zerubbabel the son of 
shealtiel  and joshua the son of 
jehozadak  the high priest  with all the 
remnant of the people  hearkened unto 
the voice of the lord their god  and 
unto t he words of haggai the prophet  
as the lord their god had sent him  
and the people did fear before the 
lord 13then spoke haggai the l ords 
messenger in the l ords message unto 
the people  saying  i am with you  
saith the lord 14and the lord stirred 
up the spirit of zerubbabel the son of 
shealtiel  governor of judah  and the 
spirit of joshua the son of jehozadak  
the high priest  and the spirit of all the 
remnant of the people  and they came 
and did work in the house of the lord 
of hosts  their god  15in the four and 
twentieth day of the month  in the 1 haggai  
897 
 sixth month  in the second year of 
darius the king   
in the seventh month  in the one 
and twentieth day of the month  
came the word of the lord by haggai 
the prophet  saying  2speak now to 
zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  
governor of judah  and to joshua the 
son of jehozadak  the high priest  and 
to the remnant of the people  saying  
3who is left among you that saw this 
house in its former glory  and how do 
ye see it now  is not such a one as 
nothing in yo ur eyes  4yet now be 
strong  o zerubbabel  saith the lord 
and be strong  o joshua  son of 
jehozadak  the high priest  and be 
strong  all ye people of the land  saith 
the lord and work  for i am with you  
saith the lord of hosts  5the word that 
i covenant ed with you when ye came 
out of egypt have i established  and 
my spirit abideth among you  fear ye 
not 6for thus saith the lord of hosts  
yet once  it is a little while  and i will 
shake the heavens  and the earth  and 
the sea  and the dry land  7and i wi ll 
shake all nations  and the choicest 
things of all nations shall come  and i 
will fill this house with glory  saith the 
lord of hosts  8mine is the silver  and 
mine the gold  saith the lord of hosts  
9the glory of this latter house shall be 
greater than that of the former  saith 
the lord of hosts  and in this place 
will i give peace  saith the lord of 
hosts   
10in the four and twentieth day of 
the ninth month  in the second year of darius  came the word of the lord by 
haggai the prophet  saying  11thus 
saith the lord of hosts  ask now the 
priests for instruction  saying  12if one 
bear hallowed flesh in the skirt of his 
garment  and with his skirt do touch 
bread  or pottage  or wine  or oil  or 
any food  shall it be holy  and the 
priests answered and sai d no 
13then said haggai  if one that is 
unclean by a dead body touch any of 
these  shall it be unclean  and the 
priests answered and said  it shall be 
unclean  14then answered haggai  
and said  so is this people  and so is 
this nation before me  saith the lord 
and so is every work of their hands  
and that which they offer there is 
unclean  15and now  i pray you  
consider from this day and forward 
before a stone was laid upon a stone in 
the temple of the lord 16through all 
that time  when one came  to a heap of 
twenty measures  there were but ten  
when one came to the winevat to draw 
out fifty press measures  there were 
but twenty  17i smote you with blasting 
and with mildew and with hail in all 
the work of your hands  yet ye turned 
not to me  saith  the l ord18consider  
i pray you  from this day and forward  
from the four and twentieth day of the 
ninth month  even from the day that 
the foundation of the l ords temple 
was laid  consider it  19is the seed yet 
in the barn  yea the vine  and the fig 
tree and the pomegranate  and the 
olive tree hath not brought forth 
from this day will i bless you   2 haggai  
898 
 20and the word of the lord came 
the second time unto haggai in the 
four and twentieth day of the month  
saying  21speak to zerubbabel  
governor of judah  saying  i will shake 
the heavens and the earth  22and i will 
overthrow the throne of kingdoms  and 
i will destroy the strength of the 
kingdoms of the nations  and i will overthrow the chariots  and those that 
ride in them  and the horses and their 
riders sh all come down  every one by 
the sword of his brother  23in that day  
saith the lord of hosts  will i take 
thee o zerubbabel  my servant  the 
son of shealtiel  saith the lord and 
will make thee as a signet  for i have 
chosen thee  saith the lord of hosts    
899 
   
zechariah  
 
in the eighth month  in the second 
year of darius  came the word of 
the lord unto zechariah the son of 
berechiah  the son of iddo  the 
prophet  saying  2the lord hath been 
sore displeased with your fathers  
3therefore say thou unt o them  thus 
saith the lord of hosts  return unto 
me saith the lord of hosts  and i will 
return unto you  saith the lord of 
hosts  4be ye not as your fathers  unto 
whom the former prophets proclaimed  
saying  thus saith the lord of hosts  
return ye now fr om your evil ways  
and from your evil doings  but they did 
not hear  nor attend unto me  saith the 
lord 5your fathers  where are they  
and the prophets  do they live for ever  
6but my words and my statutes  which 
i commanded my servants the 
prophets  did they not overtake your 
fathers  so that they turned and said  
like as the lord of hosts purposed to 
do unto us  according to our ways  and 
according to our doings  so hath he 
dealt with us   
7upon the four and twentieth day of 
the eleventh month  which is  the 
month shebat  in the second year of 
darius  came the word of the lord 
unto zechariah the son of berechiah  
the son of iddo  the prophet  saying  
8i saw in the night  and behold a man 
riding upon a red horse  and he stood among the myrtle trees that we re in 
the bottom  and behind him there were 
horses  red sorrel  and white  9then 
said i  o my lord  what are these  
and the angel that spoke with me said 
unto me  i will show thee what these 
are 10and the man that stood among 
the myrtle trees answere d and said  
these are they whom the lord hath 
sent to walk to and fro through the 
earth  11and they answered the angel 
of the lord that stood among the 
myrtle trees  and said  we have 
walked to and fro through the earth  
and behold  all the earth sitte th still  
and is at rest  12then the angel of the 
lord spoke and said  o lord of hosts  
how long wilt thou not have 
compassion on jerusalem and on the 
cities of judah  against which thou 
hast had indignation these threescore 
and ten years  13and the lord 
answered the angel that spoke with me 
with good words  even comforting 
words 14so the angel that spoke with 
me said unto me  proclaim thou  
saying  thus saith the lord of hosts  i 
am jealous for jerusalem and for zion 
with a great jealousy  15and i am ve ry 
sore displeased with the nations that 
are at ease  for i was but a little 
displeased  and they helped for evil  
16therefore thus saith the lord i 
return to jerusalem with compassions  1 zechariah  
900 
 my house shall be built in it  saith the 
lord of hosts  and a line s hall be 
stretched forth over jerusalem  
17again  proclaim  saying  thus saith 
the lord of hosts  my cities shall 
again overflow with prosperity  and 
the lord shall yet comfort zion  and 
shall yet choose jerusalem   
and i lifted up mine eyes  and 
saw and behold four horns  2and 
i said unto the angel that spoke with 
me what are these  and he said 
unto me  these are the horns which 
have scattered judah  israel  and 
jerusalem   
3and the lord showed me four 
craftsmen  4then said i  what come 
these to d o and he spoke  saying  
these the horns which scattered 
judah  so that no man did lift up his 
head these then are come to frighten 
them  to cast down the horns of the 
nations  which lifted up their horn 
against the land of judah to scatter it   
5and i lifted up mine eyes  and saw  
and behold a man with a measuring 
line in his hand  6then said i  whither 
goest thou  and he said unto me  to 
measure jerusalem  to see what is the 
breadth thereof  and what is the length 
thereof  7and behold  the angel t hat 
spoke with me went forth  and another 
angel went out to meet him  8and said 
unto him  run speak to this young 
man saying  jerusalem shall be 
inhabited without walls for the 
multitude of men and cattle therein  
9for i  saith the lord will be unto h er a wall of fire round about  and i will 
be the glory in the midst of her   
10ho ho flee then from the land of 
the north  saith the lord for i have 
spread you abroad as the four winds of 
the heaven  saith the lord 11ho zion  
escape  thou that dwelles t with the 
daughter of babylon   
12for thus saith the lord of hosts 
who sent me after glory unto the 
nations which spoiled you  surely  he 
that toucheth you toucheth the apple of 
his eye  13for behold  i will shake my 
hand over them  and they shall be a  
spoil to those that served them  and ye 
shall know that the lord of hosts hath 
sent me   
14sing and rejoice  o daughter of 
zion  for lo i come  and i will dwell 
in the midst of thee  saith the lord 
15and many nations shall join 
themselves to the lord in that day  and 
shall be my people  and i will dwell in 
the midst of thee  and thou shalt know 
that the lord of hosts hath sent me 
unto thee  16 and the lord shall inherit 
judah as his portion in the holy land  
and shall choose jerusalem again  17be 
silent all flesh  before the lord for 
he is aroused out of his holy 
habitation   
and he showed me joshua the 
high priest standing before the 
angel of the lord and satan standing 
at his right hand to accuse him  2and 
the lord said unto satan  the lord 
rebuke thee  o satan  yea the lord 
that hath chosen jerusalem rebuke 
thee is not this man a brand plucked 2 
3 zechariah  
901 
 out of the fire  3now joshua was 
clothed with filthy garments  and stood 
before the angel  4and he answered 
and spoke unto those that stood before 
him saying  take the filthy garments 
from off him  and unto him he said  
behold  i cause thine iniquity to pass 
from thee  and i will clothe thee with 
robes  5and i said  let them set a fair 
mitre upon his head  so they set a fair 
mitre upon his head  and clothed him 
with garments  and the angel of the 
lord stood by  6and the angel of the 
lord forewarned joshua  saying  
7thus saith the lord of hosts  if thou 
wilt walk in my ways  and if thou wilt 
keep my charge  and wilt also judge 
my house  and wilt also keep my 
courts  then i will give thee free access 
among these that stand by  8hear now  
o joshua the high priest  thou and thy 
fellows that sit before thee  for they 
are men that are a sign  for behold  i 
will bring forth my servant the shoot  
9for b ehold the stone that i have laid 
before joshua  upon one stone are 
seven facets  behold  i will engrave the 
graving thereof  saith the lord of 
hosts  and i will remove the iniquity 
of that land in one day  10in that day  
saith the lord of hosts  shall ye c all 
every man his neighbour under the 
vine and under the fig tree  
and the angel that spoke with me 
returned  and waked me  as a man 
that is wakened out of his sleep  2and 
he said unto me  what seest thou  
and i said  i have seen  and behold a 
candle stick all of gold  with a bowl upon the top of it  and its seven lamps 
thereon  there are seven pipes  yea 
seven  to the lamps  which are upon 
the top thereof  3and two olive trees by 
it one upon the right side of the bowl  
and the other upon the left si de 
thereof  4and i answered and spoke to 
the angel that spoke with me  saying  
what are these  my lord  5then the 
angel that spoke with me answered 
and said unto me  knowest thou not 
what these are  and i said  no my 
lord 6then he answered and spo ke 
unto me  saying  this is the word of 
the lord unto zerubbabel  saying  not 
by might  nor by power  but by my 
spirit  saith the lord of hosts  7who art 
thou o great mountain before 
zerubbabel  thou shalt become a 
plain  and he shall bring forth the top  
stone with shoutings of grace  grace  
unto it   
8moreover the word of the lord 
came unto me  saying  9the hands of 
zerubbabel have laid the foundation of 
this house  his hands shall also finish 
it and thou shalt know that the lord 
of hosts hath sent me  unto you  10for 
who hath despised the day of small 
things  even they shall see with joy the 
plummet in the hand of zerubbabel  
even these seven  which are the eyes 
of the lord that run to and fro through 
the whole earth   
11then answered i  and said unt o 
him what are these two olive trees 
upon the right side of the candlestick 
and upon the left side thereof  12and i 
answered the second time  and said 4 zechariah  
902 
 unto him  what are these two olive 
branches  which are beside the two 
golden spouts  that empty the g olden 
oil out of themselves  13and he 
answered me and said  knowest thou 
not what these are  and i said  no 
my lord  14then said he  these are 
the two anointed ones  that stand by 
the lord of the whole earth   
then again i lifted up mine eyes  
and saw  and behold a flying roll  
2and he said unto me  what seest 
thou and i answered  i see a flying 
roll the length thereof is twenty 
cubits  and the breadth thereof ten 
cubits  3then said he unto me  this is 
the curse that goeth forth over the fa ce 
of the whole land  for every one that 
stealeth shall be swept away on the 
one side like it  and every one that 
sweareth shall be swept away on the 
other side like it  4i cause it to go forth  
saith the lord of hosts  and it shall 
enter into the house of  the thief  and 
into the house of him that sweareth 
falsely by my name  and it shall abide 
in the midst of his house  and shall 
consume it with the timber thereof and 
the stones thereof   
5then the angel that spoke with me 
went forth  and said unto me  lift up 
now thine eyes  and see what is this 
that goeth forth  6and i said  what is 
it and he said  this is the measure 
that goeth forth  he said moreover  
this is their eye in all the land  7and 
behold  there was lifted up a round 
piece of lead and this is a woman 
sitting in the midst of the measure  8and he said  this is wickedness  
and he cast her down into the midst of 
the measure  and he cast the weight of 
lead upon the mouth thereof   
9then lifted i up mine eyes  and 
saw and behold  there came forth two 
women  and the wind was in their 
wings  for they had wings like the 
wings of a stork  and they lifted up the 
measure between the earth and the 
heaven  10then said i to the angel that 
spoke with me  whither do these bear 
the measure  11and he said unto me  
to build her a house in the land of 
shinar  and when it is prepared  she 
shall be set there in her own place   
and again i lifted up mine eyes  
and saw  and behold  there came 
four chariots out from between the two 
mountains  and the m ountains were 
mountains of brass  2in the first chariot 
were red horses  and in the second 
chariot black horses  3and in the third 
chariot white horses  and in the fourth 
chariot grizzled bay horses  4then i 
answered and said unto the angel that 
spoke with  me what are these  my 
lord 5and the angel answered and 
said unto me  these chariots go forth 
to the four winds of heaven  after 
presenting themselves before the lord 
of all the earth  6that wherein are the 
black horses goeth forth toward the 
north co untry  and the white went 
forth after them  and the grizzled went 
forth toward the south country  7and 
the bay went forth  and they sought 
to go that they might walk to and fro 
through the earth  and he said  get 5 
6 zechariah  
903 
 you hence  walk to and fro through the 
earth so they walked to and fro 
through the earth  8then cried he upon 
me and spoke unto me  saying  
behold  they that go toward the north 
country have eased my spirit in the 
north country   
9and the word of the lord came 
unto me  saying  10take of the m of 
the captivity  even of heldai  of 
tobijah  and of jedaiah  that are come 
from babylon  and come thou the 
same day  and go into the house of 
josiah the son of zephaniah  11yea 
take silver and gold  and make crowns  
and set the one upon the head of 
joshua the son of jehozadak  the high 
priest  12and speak unto him  saying  
thus speaketh the lord of hosts  
saying  behold  a man whose name is 
the shoot  and who shall shoot up out 
of his place  and build the temple of 
the lord 13even he shall build the 
temple of the lord and he shall bear 
the glory  and shall sit and rule upon 
his throne  and there shall be a priest 
before his throne  and the counsel of 
peace shall be between them both  
14and the crowns shall be to helem  
and to tobijah  and to jedaiah  and to 
hen the son of zephaniah  as a 
memorial in the temple of the lord 
15and they that are far off shall come 
and build in the temple of the lord 
and ye shall know that the lord of 
hosts hath sent me unto you  and it 
shall come to pass  if ye will dilig ently 
hearken to the voice of the lord your 
god  and it came to pass in the fourth 
year of king darius  that the word 
of the lord came unto zechariah in 
the fourth day of the ninth month  even 
in chislev  2when bethel sarezer  and 
regem melech and his  men had sent 
to entreat the favour of the lord 3and 
to speak unto the priests of the house 
of the lord of hosts  and to the 
prophets  saying  should i weep in the 
fifth month  separating myself  as i 
have done these so many years  
4then came the word of the lord of 
hosts unto me  saying  5speak unto all 
the people of the land  and to the 
priests  saying  when ye fasted and 
mourned in the fifth and in the seventh 
month  even these seventy years  did 
ye at all fast unto me  even to me  
6and when ye eat  and when ye did 
drink  are ye not they that eat  and they 
that drink  7should ye not hearken to 
the words which the lord hath 
proclaimed by the former prophets  
when jerusalem was inhabited and in 
prosperity  and the cities thereof round 
about her  and th e south and the 
lowland were inhabited   
8and the word of the lord came 
unto zechariah  saying  9thus hath 
the lord of hosts spoken  saying  
execute true judgment  and show 
mercy and compassion every man to 
his brother  10and oppress not the 
widow  nor t he fatherless  the stranger  
nor the poor  and let none of you 
devise evil against his brother in your 
heart  11but they refused to attend  and 
turned a stubborn shoulder  and 7 zechariah  
904 
 stopped their ears  that they might not 
hear 12yea they made their hearts as 
an adamant stone  lest they should hear 
the law  and the words which the lord 
of hosts had sent by his spirit by the 
hand of the former prophets  therefore 
came there great wrath from the lord 
of hosts  13and it came to pass that  as 
he called  and they wou ld not hear  so 
they shall call  and i will not hear  said 
the lord of hosts  14but i will scatter 
them with a whirlwind among all the 
nations whom they have not known  
thus the land was desolate after them  
so that no man passed through nor 
returned  for they laid the pleasant 
land desolate   
and the word of the lord of hosts 
came  saying  2thus saith the 
lord of hosts  i am jealous for zion 
with great jealousy  and i am jealous 
for her with great fury   
3thus saith the lord i return unto 
zion  and wi ll dwell in the midst of 
jerusalem  and jerusalem shall be 
called the city of truth  and the 
mountain of the lord of hosts the 
holy mountain   
4thus saith the lord of hosts  there 
shall yet old men and old women sit in 
the broad places of jerusalem  every 
man with his staff in his hand for very 
age 5and the broad places of the city 
shall be full of boys and girls playing 
in the broad places thereof   
6thus saith the lord of hosts  if it 
be marvellous in the eyes of the 
remnant of this people in those days  should it also be marvellous in mine 
eyes saith the lord of hosts   
7thus saith the lord of hosts  
behold  i will save my people from 
the east country  and from the west 
country  8and i will bring them  and 
they shall dwell in the midst of 
jerusalem  and they shall be my 
people  and i will be their god  in truth 
and in righteousness   
9thus saith the lord of hosts  let 
your hands be strong  ye that hear in 
these days these words from the mouth 
of the prophets that were in the day 
that the foundation of th e house of the 
lord of hosts was laid  even the 
temple  that it might be built  10for 
before those days there was no hire for 
man nor any hire for beast  neither 
was there any peace to him that went 
out or came in because of the 
adversary  for i set all m en every one 
against his neighbour  11but now i will 
not be unto the remnant of this people 
as in the former days  saith the lord of 
hosts  12for as the seed of peace  the 
vine shall give her fruit  and the 
ground shall give her increase  and the 
heavens s hall give their dew  and i will 
cause the remnant of this people to 
inherit all these things  13and it shall 
come to pass that  as ye were a curse 
among the nations  o house of judah 
and house of israel  so will i save you  
and ye shall be a blessing  fear not but 
let your hands be strong  14for thus 
saith the lord of host  as i purposed 
to do evil unto you  when your fathers 
provoked me  saith the lord of hosts  8 zechariah  
905 
 and i repented not  15so again do i 
purpose in these days to do good unto 
jerusalem and to the  house of judah  
fear ye not  16these are the things that 
ye shall do  speak ye every man the 
truth with his neighbour  execute the 
judgment of truth and peace in your 
gates  17and let none of you devise evil 
in your hearts against his neighbour  
and love no false oath  for all these are 
things that i hate  saith the lord  
18and the word of the lord of hosts 
came unto me  saying  19thus saith 
the lord of hosts  the fast of the 
fourth month  and the fast of the fifth  
and the fast of the seventh  and the fast 
of the tenth  shall be to the house of 
judah joy and gladness  and cheerful 
seasons  therefore love ye truth and 
peace  20thus saith the lord of hosts  
it shall yet come to pass  that there 
shall come peoples  and the inhabitants 
of many cities  21and the inhabitants of 
one city shall go to another  saying  
let us go speedily to entreat the favour 
of the lord and to seek the lord of 
hosts  i will go also  22yea many 
peoples and mighty nations shall come 
to seek the lord of hosts in jerusalem  
and to entreat the favour of the lord 
23thus saith the lord of hosts  in those 
days it shall come to pass  that ten men 
shall take hold  out of all the languages 
of the nations  shall even take hold of 
the skirt of him that is a jew  saying  
we will go with you  for we have 
heard that god is with you   
 the burden of the word of the 
lord  
 
in the land of hadrach   
and in damascus shall be his 
resting place   
for the l ords is the eye of man  
and all the tribes of israel   
2and hamath also shall border 
thereon   
tyre and zidon  for she is very 
wise  
3and tyre did build herself a 
stronghold   
and heaped up silver as the dust   
and fine gold as the mire of the 
streets   
4behold  the lord will impoverish 
her  
and he will smite her power into 
the sea   
and she sh all be devoured with fire   
5ashkelon shall see it  and fear   
gaza also  and shall be sore pained   
and ekron  for her expectation shall 
be ashamed   
and the king shall perish from 
gaza   
and ashkelon shall not be 
inhabited   
6and a bastard shall dwell in  
ashdod   
and i will cut off the pride of the 
philistines   
7and i will take away his blood out 
of his mouth   
and his detestable things from 
between his teeth   9 zechariah  
906 
 and he also shall be a remnant for 
our god   
and he shall be as a chief in judah   
and ekron a s a jebusite   
8and i will encamp about my house 
against the army   
that none pass through or return   
and no oppressor shall pass through 
them any more   
for now have i seen with mine 
eyes  
 
9rejoice greatly  o daughter of 
zion   
shout o daughter of jer usalem   
behold  thy king cometh unto thee   
he is triumphant  and victorious   
lowly  and riding upon an ass   
even upon a colt the foal of an ass   
10and i will cut off the chariot from 
ephraim   
and the horse from jerusalem   
and the battle bow shall be  cut off   
and he shall speak peace unto the 
nations   
and his dominion shall be from sea 
to sea   
and from the river to the ends of 
the earth   
11as for thee also  because of the 
blood of thy covenant  
i send forth thy prisoners out of the 
pit  
wherein is  no water   
12return to the stronghold   
ye prisoners of hope   
even to day do i declare  
that i will render double unto thee   
13for i bend judah for me   i fill the bow with ephraim   
and i will stir up thy sons  o zion   
against thy sons  o javan   
and will make thee as the sword of 
a mighty man   
14and the lord shall be seen over 
them   
and his arrow shall go forth as the 
lightning   
and the lord g od will blow the 
horn  
and will go with whirlwinds of the 
south   
15the lord of hosts will defend 
them   
and they shall devour  and shall 
tread down the sling stones   
and they shall drink  and make a 
noise as through wine   
and they shall be filled like the 
basins  like the corners of the 
altar  
16and the lord their god shall save 
them in that day  
as the fl ock of his people   
for they shall be as the stones of a 
crown   
glittering over his land   
17for how great is their goodness  
and how great is their beauty   
corn shall make the young men 
flourish   
and new wine the maids   
 
ask ye of the lord rain in the 
 time of the latter rain   
even of the lord that maketh 
lightnings   10 zechariah  
907 
 and he will give them showers of 
rain  
to every one grass in the field   
2for the teraphim have spoken 
vanity   
and the diviners have seen a lie   
and the dreams speak falsely   
they comfort in vain   
therefore they go their way like 
sheep   
they are afflicted  because there is 
no shepherd   
 
3mine anger is kindled against the 
shepherds   
and i will punish the he goats   
for the lord of hosts hath 
remembered his flock the house 
of jud ah  
and maketh them as his majestic 
horse in the battle   
4out of them shall come forth the 
corner stone   
out of them the stake   
out of them the battle bow   
out of them every master together   
5and they shall be as mighty men   
treading down in the mir e of the 
streets in the battle   
and they shall fight  because the 
lord is with them   
and the riders on horses shall be 
confounded   
6and i will strengthen the house of 
judah   
and i will save the house of joseph   
and i will bring them back  for i 
have c ompassion upon them   and they shall be as though i had 
not cast them off   
for i am the lord their god  and i 
will hear them   
7and they of ephraim shall be like a 
mighty man   
and their heart shall rejoice as 
through wine   
yea their children shall see it  
and rejoice  their heart shall be glad 
in the lord  
8i will hiss for them  and gather 
them   
for i have redeemed them   
and they shall increase as they have 
increased   
9and i will sow them among the 
peoples   
and they shall remember me in far 
countr ies  
and they shall live with their 
children  and shall return   
10i will bring them back also out of 
the land of egypt   
and gather them out of assyria   
and i will bring them into the land 
of gilead and lebanon   
and place shall not suffice them   
11and over the sea affliction shall 
pass  
and the waves shall be smitten in 
the sea   
and all the depths of the nile shall 
dry up   
and the pride of assyria shall be 
brought down   
and the sceptre of egypt shall 
depart away   zechariah  
908 
 12and i will strengthen them in th e 
lord  
and they shall walk up and down in 
his name   
saith the lord  
 
open thy doors  o lebanon   
that the fire may devour thy  
  cedars   
2wail  o cypress tree for the cedar 
is fallen   
because the glorious ones are 
spoiled   
wail o ye oaks of bas han  
for the strong forest is come down   
3hark  the wailing of the shepherds   
for their glory is spoiled   
hark  the roaring of young lions   
for the thickets of the jordan are 
spoiled    
4thus said the lord my god  feed 
the flock of slaughter  5whose buyers 
slay them  and hold themselves not 
guilty  and they that sell them say  
blessed be the lord for i am rich  and 
their own shepherds pity them not  
6for i will no more pity the inhabitants 
of the land  saith the lord but lo i 
will deliver the men every one into his 
neighbour s hand  and into the hand of 
his king  and they shall smite the land  
and out of their hand i will not deliver 
them  7so i fed the flock of slaughter  
verily the poor of the flock  and i took 
unto me two staves  the one i call ed 
graciousness  and the other i called 
binders  and i fed the flock  8and i cut 
off the three shepherds in one month  
for my soul became impatient of them  and their soul also loathed me  
9then said i  i will not feed you  that 
which dieth  let it die  and that which 
is to be cut off  let it be cut off  and let 
them that are left eat every one the 
flesh of another  10and i took my staff 
graciousness  and cut it asunder  that 
i might break my covenant which i 
had made with all the peoples  11and 
it wa s broken in that day  and the poor 
of the flock that gave heed unto me 
knew of a truth that it was the word of 
the lord 12and i said unto them  if 
ye think good  give me my hire  and if 
not forbear  so they weighed for my 
hire thirty pieces of silver  13and the 
lord said unto me  cast it into the 
treasury  the goodly price that i was 
prized at of them  and i took the 
thirty pieces of silver  and cast them 
into the treasury  in the house of the 
lord 14then i cut asunder mine other 
staff even binders  that the 
brotherhood between judah and israel 
might be broken   
15and the lord said unto me  take 
unto thee yet the instruments of a 
foolish shepherd  16for lo i will raise 
up a shepherd in the land  who will not 
think of those that are cut off  neithe r 
will seek those that are young  nor heal 
that which is broken  neither will he 
feed that which standeth still  but he 
will eat the flesh of the fat  and will 
break their hoofs in pieces   
17woe to the worthless shepherd  
that leaveth the flock   
the swo rd shall be upon his arm   
and upon his right eye   11 zechariah  
909 
 his arm shall be clean dried up   
and his right eye shall be utterly 
darkened   
 
the burden of the word of the 
lord concerning israel   
 
the saying of the lord who 
stretched forth the heavens   
and la id the foundation of the earth   
and formed the spirit of man within 
him  
2behold  i will make jerusalem a 
cup of staggering  
unto all the peoples round about   
and upon judah also shall it fall to 
be in the siege against jerusalem   
3and it shall come to  pass in that day   
that i will make jerusalem a stone 
of burden for all the peoples   
all that burden themselves with it 
shall be sore wounded   
and all the nations of the earth shall 
be gathered together against it   
4in that day  saith the lord  
i will  smite every horse with 
bewilderment   
and his rider with madness   
and i will open mine eyes upon the 
house of judah   
and will smite every horse of the 
peoples with blindness   
5and the chiefs of judah shall say in 
their heart   
the inhabitants of jerus alem are 
my strength  
through the lord of hosts their 
god  6in that day will i make the chiefs of 
judah  
like a pan of fire among the wood   
and like a torch of fire among 
sheaves   
and they shall devour all the 
peoples round about   
on the right hand an d on the left   
and jerusalem shall be inhabited 
again in her own place  even in 
jerusalem   
7the lord also shall save the tents 
of judah first   
that the glory of the house of david  
and the glory of the inhabitants of 
jerusalem be not magnified above 
judah  
8in that day shall the lord defend 
the inhabitants of jerusalem   
and he that stumbleth among them 
at that day shall be as david   
and the house of david shall be as a 
godlike being   
as the angel of the lord before 
them   
9and it shall come to pass i n that 
day  
that i will seek to destroy all the 
nations  
that come against jerusalem   
10and i will pour upon the house of 
david   
and upon the inhabitants of 
jerusalem   
the spirit of grace and of 
supplication   12 zechariah  
910 
 and they shall look unto me 
because athey have thrust him 
through   
and they shall mourn for him  as 
one mourneth for his only son   
and shall be in bitterness for him  as 
one that is in bitterness for his 
firstborn  
11in that day shall there be a great 
mourning in jerusalem   
as the mourning of  hadadrimmon 
in the valley of megiddon   
12and the land shall mourn  every 
family apart   
the family of the house of david 
apart  and their wives apart   
the family of the house of nathan 
apart  and their wives apart   
13the family of the house of levi 
apart and their wives apart   
the family of the shimeites apart  
and their wives apart   
14all the families that remain   
every family apart  and their wives 
apart   
 
in that day there shall be a 
 fountain opened  
to the house of david and to the 
inhabita nts of jerusalem   
for purification and for sprinkling   
2and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
saith the lord of hosts   
that i will cut off the names of the 
idols out of the land   
                                                      
a that is the nations   see verse 9  and they shall no more be 
remembered   
and also i will cause the prophe ts  
and the unclean spirit to pass out of 
the land   
3and it shall come to pass that  when 
any shall yet prophesy  then his father 
and his mother that begot him shall say 
unto him  thou shalt not live  for thou 
speakest lies in the name of the lord 
and his father and his mother that 
begot him shall thrust him through 
when he prophesieth  4and it shall 
come to pass in that day  that the 
prophets shall be brought to shame 
every one through his vision  when he 
prophesieth  neither shall they wear a 
hairy ma ntle to deceive  5but he shall 
say i am no prophet  i am a tiller of 
the ground  for i have been made a 
bondman from my youth  6and one 
shall say unto him  what are these 
wounds between thy hands  then he 
shall answer  those with which i was 
wounded in the house of my friends   
 
7awake  o sword  against my 
shepherd   
and against the man that is near 
unto me   
saith the lord of hosts   
smite the shepherd  and the sheep 
shall be scattered   
and i will turn my hand upon the 
little ones   
8and it shall c ome to pass  that in all 
the land  saith the lord  
two parts therein shall be cut off 
and die   13 zechariah  
911 
 but the third shall be left therein   
9and i will bring the third part 
through the fire   
and will refine them as silver is 
refined   
and will try them as gold  is tried   
they shall call on my name   
and i will answer them   
i will say  it is my people   
and they shall say  the lord is my 
god  
 
behold  a day of the lord 
 cometh   
when thy spoil shall be divided in 
the midst of thee   
2for i will gather a ll nations against 
jerusalem to battle   
and the city shall be taken  and the 
houses rifled   
and the women ravished   
and half of the city shall go forth 
into captivity   
but the residue of the people shall 
not be cut off from the city   
3then shall the lord go forth   
and fight against those nations   
as when he fighteth in the day of 
battle   
4and his feet shall stand in that day 
upon the mount of olives   
which is before jerusalem on the 
east  
and the mount of olives shall cleft 
in the midst thereof  
toward the east and toward the 
west  
so that there shall be a very great 
valley   and half of the mountain shall 
remove toward the north   
and half of it toward the south   
5and ye shall flee to the valley of 
the mountains   
for the valley of the mountains  shall 
reach unto azel   
yea ye shall flee  like as ye fled 
from before the earthquake  
in the days of uzziah king of judah   
and the lord my god shall come   
and all the holy ones with thee   
6and it shall come to pass in that 
day that there shall not b e light   
but heavy clouds and thick   
7and there shall be one day  
which shall be known as the 
lords  
not day  and not night   
but it shall come to pass  that at 
evening time there shall be light   
8and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that living wa ters shall go out from 
jerusalem   
half of them toward the eastern sea   
and half of them toward the western 
sea  
in summer and in winter shall it be   
9and the lord shall be king over all 
the earth   
in that day shall the lord be one  
and his name one   
10all the land shall be turned as the 
arabah  from geba to rimmon south 
of jerusalem  and she shall be lifted 
up and inhabited in her place  from 
benjamin s gate unto the place of the 
first gate  unto the corner gate  and 14 zechariah  
912 
 from the tower of hananel unto th e 
kings winepresses   
11and men shall dwell therein   
and there shall be no more 
extermination   
but jerusalem shall dwell safely   
 
12and this shall be the plague 
wherewith the lord will smite  
all the peoples that have warred 
against jerusalem   
their f lesh shall consume away 
while they stand upon their feet   
and their eyes shall consume away 
in their sockets   
and their tongue shall consume 
away in their mouth   
13and it shall come to pass in that 
day  
that a great tumult from the lord 
shall be among them   
and they shall lay hold every one 
on the hand of his neighbour   
and his hand shall rise up against 
the hand of his neighbour   
14and judah also shall fight against 
jerusalem   
and the wealth of all the nations 
round about shall be gathered 
together   
gold and silver  and apparel  in 
great abundance   
15and so shall be the plague of the 
horse   of the mule  of the camel  and of the 
ass  
and of all the beasts that shall be in 
those camps  as this plague   
 
16and it shall come to pass  that every 
one that is left of all the nations that 
came against jerusalem shall go up 
from year to year to worship the king  
the lord of hosts  and to keep the feast 
of tabernacles  17and it shall be  that 
whoso of the families of the earth 
goeth not up unto jerusalem to 
worship the king  the lord of hosts  
upon them there shall be no rain  
18and if the family of egypt go not up  
and come not  they shall have no 
overflow  there shall be the plague  
wherewith the lord will smite the 
nations that go not up to keep the fea st 
of tabernacles  19this shall be the 
punishment of egypt  and the 
punishment of all the nations that go 
not up to keep the feast of tabernacles  
20in that day shall there be upon the 
bells of the horses  holy unto the lord 
and the pots in the l ords house shall 
be like the basins before the altar  
21yea every pot in jerusalem and in 
judah shall be holy unto the lord of 
hosts  and all they that sacrifice shall 
come and take of them  and seethe 
therein  and in that day there shall be 
no more a trafficker in the house of the 
lord of hosts

malachi  
 
the burden  of the word of the 
lord to israel by malachi   
 
2i have loved you  saith the lord  
yet ye say  wherein hast thou 
loved us   
was not esau jacob s brother   
saith the lord  
yet i loved jacob   
3but esau i hated   
and made his  mountains a 
desolation   
and gave his heritage to the jackals 
of the wilderness   
4whereas edom saith   
we are beaten down   
but we will return and build the 
waste places   
thus saith the lord of hosts   
they shall build  but i will throw 
down   
and the y shall be called the border 
of wickedness   
and the people whom the lord 
execrateth for ever   
5and your eyes shall see   
and ye shall say   
the lord is great beyond the 
border of israel   
 
6a son honoureth his father   
and a servant his master   if then i be a father   
where is my honour   
and if i be a master   
where is my fear   
saith the lord of hosts  
unto you  o priests  that despise my 
name   
and ye say  wherein have we 
despised thy name   
7ye offer polluted bread upon mine 
altar  
and ye say  wherein have we 
polluted thee   
in that ye say  the table of the 
lord is contemptible   
8and when ye offer the blind for 
sacrifice  is it no evil   
and when ye offer the lame and 
sick is it no evil   
present it now unto thy governor  
will he be pleased  with thee   
or will he accept thy person   
saith the lord of hosts   
9and now  i pray you  entreat the 
favour of god  
that he may be gracious unto us  
this hath been of your doing  
will he accept any of your persons   
saith the lord of hosts   
10oh that  there were even one 
among you that would shut the 
doors   1 malachi  
914 
 that ye might not kindle fire on 
mine altar in vain   
i have no pleasure in you   
saith the lord of hosts   
neither will i accept an offering at 
your hand   
11for from the rising of the sun even 
unto the going down of the same  
my name is great among the 
nations   
and in every place offerings are 
presented unto my name   
even pure oblations   
for my name is great among the 
nations   
saith the lord of hosts   
12but ye profane it   
in that ye say   
the table of the lord is polluted   
and the fruit thereof  even the food 
thereof  is contemptible   
13ye say also   
behold  what a weariness is it   
and ye have snuffed at it   
saith the lord of hosts   
and ye have brought that which was 
taken by violenc e  
and the lame  and the sick   
thus ye bring the offering   
should i accept this of your hand   
saith the lord  
14but cursed be he that dealeth 
craftily   
whereas he hath in his flock a male   
and voweth  and sacrificeth unto 
the lord a blemished thing   
for i am a great king   
saith the lord of hosts   and my name is feared among the 
nations   
 
and now  this commandment  
is for you  o ye priests   
2if ye will not hearken  and if ye 
will not lay it to heart   
to give glory unto my name   
saith the lord of hosts   
then will i send the curse upon you   
and i will curse your blessings   
yea i curse them   
because ye do not lay it to heart   
3behold  i will rebuke the seed for 
your hurt   
and will spread dung upon your 
faces   
even the dung of your sacrifi ces  
and ye shall be taken away unto it   
4know then that i have sent  
this commandment unto you   
that my covenant might be with 
levi  
saith the lord of hosts   
5my covenant was with him  
of life and peace  and i gave them 
to him   
and of fear  and he f eared me   
and was afraid of my name   
6the law of truth was in his mouth   
and unrighteousness was not found 
in his lips   
he walked with me in peace and 
uprightness   
and did turn many away from 
iniquity   
7for the priest s lips should keep 
knowledge   2 malachi  
915 
 and they should seek the law at his 
mouth   
for he is the messenger of the lord 
of hosts   
8but ye are turned aside out of the 
way  
ye have caused many to stumble in 
the law   
ye have corrupted the covenant of 
levi  
saith the lord of hosts   
9therefore ha ve i also made you  
contemptible and base before all the 
people   
according as ye have not kept my 
ways   
but have had respect of persons in 
the law   
 
10have we not all one father   
hath not one god created us   
why do we deal treacherously every 
man agai nst his brother   
profaning the covenant of our 
fathers   
11judah hath dealt treacherously   
and an abomination is committed in 
israel and in jerusalem   
for judah hath profaned the 
holiness of the lord which he 
loveth   
and hath married the daughter of a 
strange god   
12may the lord cut off to the man 
that doeth this   
him that calleth and him that 
answereth out of the tents of 
jacob   and him that offereth an offering 
unto the lord of hosts   
13and this further ye do   
ye cover the altar of the lord with 
tears   
with weeping  and with sighing   
insomuch that he regardeth not the 
offering any more   
neither receiveth it with good will 
at your hand   
14yet ye say  wherefore   
because the lord hath been witness  
between thee and the wife of thy 
youth   
against whom thou hast dealt 
treacherously   
though she is thy companion   
and the wife of thy covenant   
15and not one hath done so  
who had exuberance of spirit   
for what seeketh the one   
a seed given of god   
therefore take heed to your spirit   
and let n one deal treacherously 
against the wife of his youth   
16for i hate putting away   
saith the lord the god of israel   
and him that covereth his garment 
with violence   
saith the lord of hosts   
therefore take heed to your spirit   
that ye deal not treache rously   
 
17ye have wearied the lord with 
your words   
yet ye say  wherein have we 
wearied him   
in that ye say  every one that doeth 
evil  malachi  
916 
 is good in the sight of the lord  
and he delighteth in them   
or where is the god of justice   
 
behold  i sen d my messenger  
and he shall clear the way before 
 me  
and the lord  whom ye seek   
will suddenly come to his temple   
and the messenger of the covenant   
whom ye delight in   
behold  he cometh   
saith the lord of hosts   
2but who may abide the day of his  
coming   
and who shall stand when he 
appeareth   
for he is like a refiner s fire   
and like fullers soap  
3and he shall sit as a refiner and 
purifier of silver   
and he shall purify the sons of levi   
and purge them as gold and silver   
and there shall b e they that shall 
offer unto the lord  
offerings in righteousness   
4then shall the offering of judah 
and jerusalem  
be pleasant unto the lord  
as in the days of old   
and as in ancient years   
 
5and i will come near to you to 
judgment   
and i will be a s wift witness  
against the sorcerers  and against 
the adulterers   
and against false swearers   and against those that oppress the 
hireling in his wages   
the widow  and the fatherless   
and that turn aside the stranger 
from his right   
and fear not me   
saith the lord of hosts   
6for i the lord change not   
and ye  o sons of jacob  are not 
consumed   
 
7from the days of your fathers ye 
have turned aside  
from mine ordinances  and have not 
kept them   
return unto me  and i will return 
unto you   
saith the lord of hosts   
but ye say  wherein shall we 
return   
8will a man rob god   
yet ye rob me   
but ye say  wherein have we 
robbed thee   
in tithes and heave offerings   
9ye are cursed with the curse   
yet ye rob me   
even this whole nation   
10bring ye the w hole tithe into the 
store house   
that there may be food in my 
house   
and try me now herewith   
saith the lord of hosts   
if i will not open you the windows 
of heaven   
and pour you out a blessing   
that there shall be more than 
sufficiency   3 malachi  
917 
 11and i will  rebuke the devourer for 
your good   
and he shall not destroy the fruits of 
your land   
neither shall your vine cast its fruit 
before the time in the field   
saith the lord of hosts   
12and all nations shall call you 
happy   
for ye shall be a delightsome l and  
saith the lord of hosts   
 
13your words have been all too 
strong against me   
saith the lord  
yet ye say  wherein have we 
spoken against thee   
14ye have said  it is vain to serve 
god  
and what profit is it that we have 
kept his charge   
and tha t we have walked 
mournfully  
because of the lord of hosts   
15and now we call the proud happy   
yea they that work wickedness are 
built up   
yea they try god  and are 
delivered   
16then they that feared the lord  
spoke one with another   
and the lord hearkened  and heard   
and a book of remembrance was 
written before him   
for them that feared the lord and 
that thought upon his name   
17and they shall be mine  saith the 
lord of hosts   in the day that i do make  even 
mine own treasure   
and i will spare  them  as a man 
spareth  
his own son that serveth him   
18then shall ye again discern 
between the righteous and the 
wicked   
between him that serveth god  
and him that serveth him not   
19for behold  the day cometh   
it burneth as a furnace   
and all the proud  and all that work 
wickedness  shall be stubble   
and the day that cometh shall set 
them ablaze   
saith the lord of hosts   
that it shall leave them neither root 
nor branch   
20but unto you that fear my name  
shall the sun of righteousness arise 
with healing in its wings   
and ye shall go forth  and gambol  
as calves of the stall   
21and ye shall tread down the 
wicked   
for they shall be ashes under the 
soles of your feet  
in the day that i do make   
saith the lord of hosts   
 
22remember ye the law of  moses 
my servant   
which i commanded unto him in 
horeb for all israel   
even statutes and ordinances   
23behold  i will send you  
elijah the prophet  
before the coming  malachi  
918 
 of the great and terrible day of the 
lord  
24and he shall turn the heart of the 
fathe rs to the children   and the heart of the children to their 
fathers   
lest i come and smite the land with 
utter destruction   
 
behold i will send you

happy is the man that hath not 
 walked in the counsel of the 
 wicked  
nor stood in the way of sinne rs  
nor sat in the seat of the scornful  
2but his delight is in the law of the 
lord  
and in his law doth he meditate day 
and night  
3and he shall be like a tree planted 
by streams of water  
that bringeth forth its fruit in its 
season  
and whose leaf do th not wither  
and in whatsoever he doeth he shall 
prosper  
 
4not so the wicked  
but they are like the chaff which the 
wind driveth away  
5therefore the wicked shall not 
stand in the judgment  
nor sinners in the congregation of 
the righteous  
6for the lord regardeth the way of 
the righteous

perish

20oh how abundant is thy 
goodness which thou hast laid 
up for them that fear thee  which thou hast wrought for them 
that take their refuge in thee in 
the sight of the sons of men

from the strife of tongues  
22blessed be the lord  
for he hath shown me his 
wondrous lovingkindness in an 
entrenched city  
23as for me i said in my haste i am 
cut off from before thine eyes  
nevertheless thou heardest the 
voice of my supplications when i

lovingkindness o god  
and the children of men take refuge 
in the shadow of thy wings  
9they are abundantly satisfied with 
the fatness of thy house

river of thy pleasures

 psalms

book  iii 
 
a psalm of asaph  
 
surely  god is good to israel  
even to such as are pure in heart  
2but as for me my feet were almost 
gone  
my steps had well nigh slipped  
3for i was envious at the arrogant  
when i saw the prosperity of the 
wicked  
4for there are no pangs at their 
death  
and their body is sound  
5in the trouble of man they are not  
neither are they plagued like men  
6therefore pride is as a chain about 
their neck  
violence covereth them as a 
garment  
7their eyes stand forth  from fatness  
they are gone beyond the 
imaginations of their heart  
8they scoff and in wickedness utter 
oppression  
they speak as if there were none on 
high  
9they have set their mouth against 
the heavens  
and their tongue walketh through 
the earth  
10therefore his people return hither  
and waters of fullness are drained 
out by them  11and they say how doth god 
know  
and is there knowledge in the most 
high  
12behold such are the wicked  
and they that are always at ease 
increase riches  
13surely in vain have i cleansed my 
heart  
and washed my hands in 
innocency  
14for all the day have i been 
plagued  
and my chastisement came every 
morning  
 
15if i had said i will speak thus   
behold i had been faithless to the 
generation of thy children  
16and when i pondered how i might 
know this  
it was wearisome in mine eyes  
17until i entered into the sanctuary 
of god  
and considered their end  
18surely thou settest them in 
slippery places  
thou hurlest them down to utter 
ruin 
19how are they become a desolation 
in a moment  
they are wholly consumed by 
terrors  
20as a dream when one awaketh  
so o lord when thou arousest 
thyself thou wilt despise their 
semblance  
21for my heart was in a ferment  
and i was pricked in my reins  73 psalms  
982 
 22but i was brutish a nd ignorant  
i was as a beast before thee  
 
23nevertheless i am continually with 
thee  
thou holdest my right hand  
24thou wilt guide me with thy 
counsel  
and afterward receive me with 
glory  
25whom have i in heaven but thee  
and beside thee i desire no ne upon 
earth  
26my flesh and my heart faileth  
but god is the rock of my heart and 
my portion for ever  
27for lo they that go far from thee 
shall perish  
thou dost destroy all them that go 
astray from thee  
28but as for me the nearness of god 
is my g ood  
i have made the lord g od my 
refuge  
that i may tell of all thy works  
 
maschil of asaph  
 
why o god hast thou cast us off 
for ever  
why doth thine anger smoke 
against the flock of thy pasture  
2remember thy congregation 
which thou hast gotte n of old  
which thou hast redeemed to be the 
tribe of thine inheritance  
and mount zion wherein thou hast 
dwelt  3lift up thy steps because of the 
perpetual ruins  
even all the evil that the enemy hath 
done in the sanctuary  
4thine adversaries have roa red in 
the midst of thy meeting place  
they have set up their own signs for 
signs  
5it seemed as when men wield 
upwards  
axes in a thicket of trees  
6and now all the carved work 
thereof together  
they strike down with hatchet and 
hammers  
7they have set t hy sanctuary on 
fire  
they have profaned the dwelling 
place of thy name even to the 
ground  
8they said in their heart let us 
make havoc of them altogether  
they have burned up all the 
meeting places of god in the 
land  
9we see not our signs  
there is  no more any prophet  
neither is there among us any that 
knoweth how long  
10how long o god shall the 
adversary reproach  
shall the enemy blaspheme thy 
name for ever  
11why withdrawest thou thy hand 
even thy right hand  
draw it out of thy bosom and 
consume them  
 
12yet god is my king of old  74 psalms  
983 
 working salvation in the midst of 
the earth  
13thou didst break the sea in pieces 
by thy strength  
thou didst shatter the heads of the 
seamonsters in the waters  
14thou didst crush the heads of 
leviathan  
thou  gavest him to be food to the 
folk inhabiting the wilderness  
15thou didst cleave fountain and 
brook  
thou driedst up ever flowing rivers  
16thine is the day thine also the 
night  
thou hast established luminary and 
sun 
17thou hast set all the borders o f the 
earth  
thou hast made summer and winter  
 
18remember this how the enemy 
hath reproached the lord  
and how a base people have 
blasphemed thy name  
19o deliver not the soul of thy 
turtle dove unto the wild beast  
forget not the life of thy poor for  
ever  
20look upon the covenant  
for the dark places of the land are 
full of the habitations of violence  
21o let not the oppressed turn back 
in confusion  
let the poor and needy praise thy 
name  
22arise o god plead thine own 
cause  remember thy repro ach all the day

2i will open my mouth with a 
parable  
i will utter dark sayings concerning 
days of old  
3that which we have heard and 
known  
and our fathers have told us  
4we will not hide f rom their 
children  
telling to the generation to come 
the praises of the lord  
and his strength and his wondrous 
works that he hath done  
 78 psalms  
986 
 5for he established a testimony in 
jacob  
and appointed a law in israel  
which he commanded our fathers  
that they should make them known 
to their children  
6that the generation to come might 
know them even the children that 
should be born  
who should arise and tell them to 
their children  
7that they might put their 
confidence in god  
and not forget the works of  god  
but keep his commandments  
8and might not be as their fathers  
a stubborn and rebellious 
generation  
a generation that set not their heart 
aright  
and whose spirit was not stedfast 
with god  
 
9the children of ephraim were as 
archers handling the bow  
that turned back in the day of 
battle  
10they kept not the covenant of 
god  
and refused to walk in his law  
11and they forgot his doings  
and his wondrous works that he 
had shown them  
12marvellous things did he in the 
sight of their fathers  
in the land of egypt in the field of 
zoan  
13he cleaved the sea and caused 
them to pass through  and he made the waters to stand as 
a heap  
14by day also he led them with a 
cloud  
and all the night with a light of fire  
15he cleaved rocks in the 
wilderness   
and gave them drink abundantly as 
out of the great deep  
16he brought streams also out of the 
rock  
and caused waters to run down like 
rivers  
 
17yet went they on still to sin 
against him  
to rebel against the most high in 
the desert  
18and they tried  god in their heart  
by asking food for their craving  
19yea they spoke against god  
they said can god prepare a table 
in the wilderness  
20behold he smote the rock that 
waters gushed out  
and streams overflowed  
can he give bread also  
or will he provide flesh for his 
people  
21therefore the lord heard and was 
wroth  
and a fire was kindled against 
jacob  
and anger also went up against 
israel  
22because they believed not in god  
and trusted not in his salvation  
23and he commanded the skies 
above  psalms  
987 
 and opened the doors of heaven  
24and he caused manna to rain 
upon them for food  
and gave them of the corn of 
heaven  
25man did eat the bread of the 
mighty  
he sent them provisions to the full  
26he caused the east wind to set 
forth in heaven  
and by his power he brought on 
the south wind  
27he caused flesh also to rain upon 
them as the dust  
and winged fowl as the sand of the 
seas  
28and he let it fall in the midst of 
their camp  
round about their dwellings  
29so they did eat and were well 
filled  
and he gave them that which they 
craved  
30they were not estranged from 
their craving  
their food was yet in their mouths  
31when the anger of god went up 
against them  
and slew of the lustieth among 
them  
and smote down the young men of 
israel  
 
32for all this they sinned still  
and believed not in his wondrous 
works  
33therefore he ended their days as a 
breath  
and their years in terror  34when he slew them then they 
would inquire after him  
and turn back and seek god 
earnestly  
35and they rem embered that god 
was their rock  
and the most high god their 
redeemer  
36but they beguiled him with their 
mouth  
and lied unto him with their 
tongue  
37for their heart was not stedfast 
with him  
neither were they faithful in his 
covenant  
38but he bein g full of compassion 
forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth 
not  
yea many a time doth he turn his 
anger away  
and doth not stir up all his wrath  
39so he remembered that they were 
but flesh  
a wind that passeth away and 
cometh not again  
 
40how oft did t hey rebel against 
him in the wilderness  
and grieve him in the desert  
41and still again they tried god  
and set bounds to the holy one of 
israel  
42they remembered not his hand  
nor the day when he redeemed 
them from the adversary  
43how he set his sig ns in egypt  
and his wonders in the field of 
zoan  psalms  
988 
 44and turned their rivers into blood  
so that they could not drink their 
streams  
45he sent among them swarms of 
flies which devoured them  
and frogs which destroyed them  
46he gave also their increas e unto 
the caterpillar  
and their labour unto the locust  
47he destroyed their vines with hail  
and their sycamore trees with frost  
48he gave over their cattle also to 
the hail  
and their flocks to fiery bolts  
49he sent forth upon them the 
fierceness of his anger  
wrath and indignation and trouble  
a sending of messengers of evil  
50he levelled a path for his anger  
he spared not their soul from death  
but gave their life over to the 
pestilence  
51and smote all the first born in 
egypt  
the first fruits of their strength in 
the tents of ham  
52but he made his own people to go 
forth like sheep  
and guided them in the wilderness 
like a flock  
53and he led them safely and they 
feared not  
but the sea overwhelmed their 
enemies  
54and he brought the m to his holy 
border  
to the mountain which his right 
hand had gotten  55he drove out the nations also 
before them  
and allotted them for an inheritance 
by line  
and made the tribes of israel to 
dwell in their tents  
 
56yet they tried and provoked god  
the most high  
and kept not his testimonies  
57but turned back and dealt 
treacherously like their fathers  
they were turned aside like a 
deceitful bow  
58for they provoked him with their 
high places  
and moved him to jealousy with 
their graven images  
59god heard and was wroth  
and he greatly abhorred israel  
60and he forsook the tabernacle of 
shiloh  
the tent which he had made to 
dwell among men  
61and delivered his strength into 
captivity  
and his glory into the adversarys 
hand  
62he gave his pe ople over also unto 
the sword  
and was wroth with his inheritance  
63fire devoured their young men  
and their virgins had no marriage 
song  
64their priests fell by the sword  
and their widows made no 
lamentation  
 psalms  
989 
 65then the lord awaked as one 
asleep  
like a mighty man recovering from 
wine  
66and he smote his adversaries 
backward  
he put upon them a perpetual 
reproach  
67moreover he abhorred the tent of 
joseph  
and chose not the tribe of ephraim  
68but chose the tribe of judah  
the mount zion which h e loved  
69and he built his sanctuary like 
the heights  
like the earth which he hath 
founded for ever  
70he chose david also his servant  
and took him from the sheepfolds  
71from following the ewes that give 
suck he brought him  
to be shepherd over jaco b his 
people and israel his inheritance  
72so he shepherded them according 
to the integrity of his heart  
and lead them by the skilfulness of 
his hands

angry for ever

like fire

nations that  know thee not

9thou didst pluck up a vine out of 
egypt

land  
11the mountains were covered with 
the shadow of it  
and the mighty cedars with the 
boughs thereof

in the morning they are like grass 
which groweth up  
6in the morning it flourisheth and

threescore years and ten

fourscore years

my refuge  
even the most high thy habitation  
10there shall no evil befall thee

thy tent

hands  
lest thou dash thy foot against a 
stone  
13thou shalt tread upon the lion and 
asp  
the young lion and the serpent shalt 
thou trample under feet

4they gush out they speak 
arrogancy  
all the workers of iniquity bear 
them selves loftily  
5they crush thy people o lord  
and afflict thy heritage  
6they slay the widow and the 
stranger  
and murder the fatherless  
7and they say the lord will not 
see  
neither will the god of jacob give 
heed  
 
8consider ye brutish among the  
people  and ye fools when will ye 
understand  
9he that planted the ear shall he not 
hear  
he that formed the eye shall he not 
see 
10he that instructeth nations shall 
not he correct  
even he that teacheth man 
knowledge  
11the lord knoweth the thoug hts of 
man  
that they are vanity  
 
12happy is the man whom thou 
instructest o lord  
and teachest out of thy law  
13that thou mayest give him rest 
from the days of evil  
until the pit be digged for the 
wicked  
14for the lord will not cast off his 
people   
neither will he forsake his 
inheritance  
15for right shall return unto justice  
and all the upright in heart shall 
follow it  
 
16who will rise up for me against 
the evil doers  
who will stand up for me against 
the workers of iniquity  
17unless the lord had been my help  
my soul had soon dwelt in silence  
18if i say my foot slippeth  
thy mercy o lord holdeth me up  
19when my cares are many within 
me  94 psalms  
1003  
 thy comforts delight my soul  
 
20shall the seat of wickedness have 
fellowship with thee  
which frameth mischief by statute  
21they gather themselves together 
against the soul of the righteous  
and condemn innocent blood  
22but the lord hath been my high 
tower  
and my god the rock of my refuge  
23and he hath brought upon them 
their own iniquity  
and will cut them off in their own 
evil  
the lord our god will cut them off

meribah  
as in the day of massah  in the 
wilderness  
9when your fathers tried me  
proved me even though they saw 
my work  
10for forty years was i wearied with 
that generation  
and said it is a people that do err in 
their heart  
and they have not known my ways  
11wherefore i swore in my wrath  
that they should not enter into my 
arest

 2o lord hear my prayer  
and let my cry come unto thee  
3hide not thy face from me in the 
day of my distress  
incline thine ear unto me  
in the day when i call answer me 
speedily  
 
4for my days are consumed like 
smoke  
and my bones are burned as a 
hearth  
5my heart is smitten like grass and 
withered  
for i forget to eat my bread  
6by reason of the v oice of my 
sighing  
my bones cleave to my flesh  
7i am like a pelican of the 
wilderness  
i am become as an owl of the waste 
places  
8i watch and am become  
like a sparrow that is alone upon 
the housetop  
9mine enemies taunt me all the day  
they that are  mad against me do 
curse by me  
10for i have eaten ashes like bread  
and mingled my drink with 
weeping  
11because of thine indignation and 
thy wrath  
for thou hast taken me up and cast 
me away  
12my days are like a lengthening 
shadow  
and i am withered  like grass  
 13but thou o lord sittest 
enthroned for ever  
and thy name is unto all 
generations  
14thou wilt arise and have 
compassion upon zion  
for it is time to be gracious unto 
her for the appointed time is 
come  
15for thy servants take pleasure  in 
her stones  
and love her dust  
16so the nations will fear the name 
of the lord  
and all the kings of the earth thy 
glory  
17when the lord hath built up zion  
when he hath appeared in his 
glory  
18when he hath regarded the prayer 
of the destitute  
and hath not despised their prayer  
 
19this shall be written for the 
generation to come  
and a people which shall be created 
shall praise the lord 
20for he hath looked down from the 
height of his sanctuary  
from heaven did the lord behold 
the earth  
21to hear the groaning of the 
prisoner  
to loose those that are appointed to 
death  
22that men may tell of the name of 
the lord in zion  
and his praise in jerusalem  psalms  
1008  
 23when the peoples are gathered 
together  
and the kingdoms to serve the 
lord 
 
24he weaken ed my strength in the 
way  
he shortened my days  
25i say o my god take me not 
away in the midst of my days  
thou whose years endure 
throughout all generations  
26of old thou didst lay the 
foundation of the earth  
and the heavens are the work of 
thy h ands  
27they shall perish but thou shalt 
endure  
yea all of them shall wax old like a 
garment  
as a vesture shalt thou change 
them and they shall pass away  
28but thou art the selfsame  
and thy years shall have no end  
29the children of thy servants shall 
dwell securely  
and their seed shall be established 
before thee  
 
a psalm  of david  
 
bless the lord o my soul  
and all that is within me bless his 
holy name  
2bless the lord o my soul  
and forget not all his benefits  
3who forgiveth all  thine iniquity  
who healeth all thy diseases  4who redeemeth thy life from the 
pit  
who encompasseth thee with 
lovingkindness and tender 
mercies  
5who satisfieth thine old age with 
good things  
so that thy youth is renewed like 
the eagle  
 
6the lord executeth righteousness  
and acts of justice for all that are 
oppressed  
7he made known his ways unto 
moses  
his doings unto the children of 
israel  
8the lord is full of compassion and 
gracious  
slow to anger and plenteous in 
mercy  
9he will not always c ontend  
neither will he keep his anger for 
ever  
10he hath not dealt with us after our 
sins  
nor requited us according to our 
iniquities  
11for as the heaven is high above the 
earth  
so great is his mercy toward them 
that fear him  
12as far as the east is from the west  
so far hath he removed our 
transgressions from us  
13like as a father hath compassion 
upon his children  
so hath the lord compassion upon 
them that fear him  103 psalms  
1009  
 14for he knoweth our frame  
he remembereth that we are dust  
15as for man hi s days are as grass  
as a flower of the field so he 
flourisheth  
16for the wind passeth over it and it 
is gone  
and the place thereof knoweth it no 
more  
17but the mercy of the lord is from 
everlasting to everlasting upon 
them that fear him  
and his r ighteousness unto 
childrens children  
18to such as keep his covenant  
and to those that remember his 
precepts to do them  
 
19the lord hath established his 
throne in the heavens  
and his kingdom ruleth over all  
20bless the lord ye angels of his  
ye mighty in strength that fulfil his 
word  
hearkening unto the voice of his 
word  
21bless the lord all ye his hosts  
ye ministers of his that do his 
pleasure  
22bless the lord all ye his works  
in all places of his dominion  
bless the lord o my soul  
 
bless the lord o my 
 soul  
o lord my god thou art very 
great  
thou art clothed with glory and 
majesty  2who coverest thyself with light as 
with a garment  
who stretchest out the heavens like 
a curtain  
3who layest the beams of thine 
upper chamber s in the waters  
who makest the clouds thy chariot  
who walkest upon the wings of the 
wind  
4who makest winds thy 
messengers  
the flaming fire thy ministers  
 
5who didst establish the earth upon 
its foundations  
that it should not be moved for ever 
and ever  
6thou didst cover it with the deep as 
with a vesture  
the waters stood above the 
mountains  
7at thy rebuke they fled  
at the voice of thy thunder they 
hasted away  
8the mountains rose the valleys 
sank down  
unto the place which thou hadst 
founded  for them  
9thou didst set a bound which they 
should not pass over  
that they might not return to cover 
the earth  
 
10who sendest forth springs into the 
valleys  
they run between the mountains  
11they give drink to every beast of 
the field  
the wild ass es quench their thirst  104 psalms  
1010  
 12beside them dwell the fowl of the 
heaven  
from among the branches they sing  
13who waterest the mountains from 
thine upper chambers  
the earth is full of the fruit of thy 
works  
 
14who causeth the grass to spring up 
for the catt le  
and herb for the service of man  
to bring forth bread out of the earth  
15and wine that maketh glad the 
heart of man  
making the face brighter than oil  
and bread that stayeth mans heart  
16the trees of the lord have their 
fill  
the cedars of leb anon which he 
hath planted  
17wherein the birds make their 
nests  
as for the stork the fir trees are her 
house  
18the high mountains are for the 
wild goats  
the rocks are a refuge for the 
conies  
 
19who appointedst the moon for 
seasons  
the sun knowet h his going down  
20thou makest darkness and it is 
night  
wherein all the beasts of the forest 
do creep forth  
21the young lions roar after their 
prey  
and seek their food from god  22the sun ariseth they slink away  
and couch in their dens  
23man goe th forth unto his work  
and to his labour until the evening  
 
24how manifold are thy works o 
lord  
in wisdom hast thou made them all  
the earth is full of thy creatures  
25yonder sea great and wide  
therein are creeping things 
innumerable  
living cre atures both small and 
great  
26there go the ships  
there is leviathan whom thou hast 
formed to sport therein  
27all of them wait for thee  
that thou mayest give them their 
food in due season  
28thou givest it unto them they 
gather it  
thou openest th y hand they are 
satisfied with good  
29thou hidest thy face they vanish  
thou withdrawest their breath they 
perish  
and return to their dust  
30thou sendest forth thy spirit they 
are created  
and thou renewest the face of the 
earth

for a statute  
to israel for an everlasting 
covenant  
11saying unto th ee will i give the 
land of canaan  
the lot of your inheritance  
 
12when they were but a few men in

yea very few and sojourners in it  
13and when they went about from 
nation to nation  
from one kingdom to another 
people  
14he suffered no man t o do them 
wrong  
yea for their sake he reproved 
kings  
15touch not mine anointed ones  
and do my prophets no harm  
 
16and he called a famine upon the 
land  
he broke the whole staff of bread  
17he sent a man before them

his person was laid in iron

 the word of the lord tested him  
20the king sent and loosed him  
even the ruler of the peoples and 
set him free  
21he made him lord of his ho use  
and ruler of all his possessions  
22to bind his princes at his pleasure  
and teach his elders wisdom  
 
23israel also came into egypt  
and jacob sojourned in the land of 
ham  
24and he increased his people 
greatly  
and made them too mighty for their  
adversaries  
25he turned their heart to hate his 
people  
to deal craftily with his servants  
26he sent moses his servant  
and aaron whom he had chosen  
27they wrought among them his 
manifold signs  
and wonders in the land of ham  
28he sent darkness an d it was dark  
and they rebelled not against his 
word  
29he turned their waters into blood  
and slew their fish

in the chambers of their kings  
31he spoke and there came swarms 
of flies  
and gnats in all their borders  
32he gave them hail for rain  
and flaming fire in their land  
33he smote their vines also and their 
figtrees  
and broke the trees of their borders  34he spoke and the locust came  
and the canker worm without 
number  
35and did eat up every herb in th eir 
land  
and did eat up the fruit of their 
ground  
36he smote also all the first born in 
their land

37and he brought them forth with 
silver and gold  
and there was none that stumbled 
among his tribes

quails  
and gave them in plenty the bread 
of heaven  
41he opened the rock and wat ers

they ran a river in the dry places  
42for he remembered his holy word  
unto abraham his servant  
43and he brought forth his people 
with joy  
his chosen ones with singing  
44and he gave them the lands of the 
nations  
and they took the la bour of the

6we have sinned with our fathers  
we have done iniquitously we have 
dealt wickedly  
7our fathers in egypt gave no heed 
unto thy wonders  
they remembered not the multitud e 
of thy mercies  
but were rebellious at the sea even 
at the red sea  
8nevertheless he saved them for 
his names sake  
that he might make his mighty 
power to be known  
9and he rebuked the red sea and it 
was dried up  
and he led them through the 
depths  as through a wilderness  10and he saved them from the hand 
of him that hated them  
and redeemed them from the hand 
of the enemy  
11and the waters covered their 
adversaries  
there was not one of them left  
12then believed they his words  
they sang his praise  
 
13they soon forgot his works  
they waited not for his counsel  
14but lusted exceedingly in the 
wilderness  
and tried god in the desert  
15and he gave them their request  
but sent leanness into their soul  
 
16they were jealous also of moses 
in the camp  
and of aaron the holy one of the 
lord 
17the earth opened and swallowed 
up dathan  
and covered the company of 
abiram  
18and a fire was kindled in their 
company  
the flame burned up the wicked  
 
19they made a calf in horeb  
and worshipped a mol ten image  
20thus they exchanged their glory  
for the likeness of an ox that eateth 
grass  
21they forgot god their saviour  
who had done great things in egypt  
22wondrous works in the land of 
ham  106 psalms  
1014  
 terrible things by the red sea  
23therefore he said that he would 
destroy them  
had not moses his chosen stood 
before him in the breach  
to turn back his wrath lest he 
should destroy them  
 
24moreover they scorned the 
desirable land  
they believed not his word  
25and they murmured in their tents  
they hear kened not unto the voice 
of the lord 
26therefore he swore concerning 
them  
that he would overthrow them in 
the wilderness  
27and that he would cast out their 
seed among the nations  
and scatter them in the lands  
 
28they joined themselves also unto 
baal of peor  
and ate the sacrifices of the dead  
29thus they provoked him with 
their doings  
and the plague broke in upon them  
30then stood up phinehas and 
wrought judgment  
and so the plague was stayed  
31and that was counted unto him for 
righteousness   
unto all generations for ever  
 
32they angered him also at the 
waters of meribah  
and it went ill with moses because 
of them  33for they embittered his spirit  
and he spoke rashly with his lips  
 
34they did not destroy the peoples  
as the lord command ed them  
35but mingled themselves with the 
nations  
and learned their works  
36and they served their idols  
which became a snare unto them  
37yea they sacrificed their sons and 
their daughters unto demons  
38and shed innocent blood even the 
blood of th eir sons and of their 
daughters  
whom they sacrificed unto the idols 
of canaan  
and the land was polluted with 
blood  
39thus were they defiled with their 
works  
and went astray in their doings  
40therefore was the wrath of the 
lord kindled against his p eople  
and he abhorred his inheritance  
41and he gave them into the hand of 
the nations  
and they that hated them ruled over 
them  
42their enemies also oppressed 
them  
and they were subdued under their 
hand  
43many times did he deliver them  
but they w ere rebellious in their 
counsel  
and sank low through their iniquity  
44nevertheless he looked upon their 
distress  psalms  
1015  
 when he heard their cry  
45and he remembered for them his 
covenant  
and repented according to the 
multitude of his mercies  
46he made the m also to be pitied  
of all those that carried them 
captive  
 
47save us o lord our god  
and gather us from among the 
nations  
that we may give thanks unto thy 
holy name  
that we may triumph in thy praise  
 
48blessed be the lord the god of 
israel  
from everlasting even to 
everlasting

3and gathered them out of the lands  
from the east and from the west  
from the north and from the sea  
 4they wandered in the wilderness in 
a desert way  
they found no city of habitation  
5hungry and thirsty  
their soul faint ed in them

their trouble

8let them give thanks unto the lord 
for his mercy  
and for his wo nderful works to the 
children of men  
9for he hath satisfied the longing 
soul  
and the hungry soul he hath filled 
with good  
 
10such as sat in darkness and in the 
shadow of death  
being bound in affliction and iron  
11because they rebelled against the 
words of god  
and contemned the counsel of the 
most high  
12therefore he humbled their heart 
with travail  
they stumbled and there was none 
to help  
13they cried unto the lord in their 
trouble  
and he saved them out of their 
distresses  
14he brought them  out of darkness

brass  
and cut the bars of iron in sunde r 
 
17crazed because of the way of their 
transgression  
and afflicted because of their 
iniquities  
18their soul abhorred all manner of 
food  
and they drew near unto the gates 
of death  
19they cried unto the lord in their 
trouble  
and he saved them out o f their 
distresses  
20he sent his word and healed 
them  
and delivered them from their 
graves  
21let them give thanks unto the 
lord for his mercy

children of men  
22and let them offer the sacrifices of 
thanksgiving  
and declare his works with singing  
 
23they that go down to the sea in 
ships  
that do business in great waters  
24these saw the works of the lord  
and his wonders in the deep  
25for he commanded and raised the 
stormy wind  which lifted up the waves ther eof 
26they mounted up to the heaven 
they went down to the deeps  
their soul melted away because of 
trouble  
27they reeled to and fro and 
staggered like a drunken man  
and all their wisdom was 
swallowed up  
28they cried unto the lord in their 
trouble  
and he brought them out of their 
distresses  
29he made the storm a calm  
so that the waves thereof were still  
30then were they glad because they 
were quiet  
and he led them unto their desired 
haven  
31let them give thanks unto the 
lord for his mercy  
and for his wonderful works to the 
children of men  
32let them exalt him also in the 
assembly of the people  
and praise him in the seat of the 
elders  
33he turneth rivers into a wilderness  
and watersprings into a thirsty 
ground  
34a fruitful land into a  salt waste  
for the wickedness of them that 
dwell therein  
 
35he turneth a wilderness into a pool 
of water  
and a dry land into watersprings  
36and there he maketh the hungry 
to dwell  psalms

vineyards  
which yield fruits of increase

are multiplied greatly  
and suffereth not their cattle to 
decrease  
 
39again they are minished and 
dwindle away  
through oppression of evil and 
sorrow  
40he poureth conte mpt upon princes  
and causeth them to wander in the 
waste where there is no way  
41yet setteth he the needy on high 
from affliction  
and maketh his families like a 
flock

david  
 
o god of my praise keep not 
silence  
2for the mouth of the wicked and 
the mouth of deceit have they 
opened against me  
they have spoken unto me with a 
lying tongue  
3they compassed me about also 
with words of hatred  
and fought against me without a 
cause  
4in return for my love they are my 
adversaries  
but i am all prayer  
5and they have laid upon me evil 
for good  
and hatred for my love  
 
6set thou a wicked man over him  
and let an adversary stand at his 
right hand  
7when he is judged let him go forth 
condemned  
and let his prayer be turned into sin  
8let his days be few  
let another take his charge  
9let his children be fatherless  
and his wife a widow  
10let his children be vagabonds and 
beg  
and let them seek their bread out of 
their desolate plac es 
11let the creditor distrain all that he 
hath  
and let strangers make spoil of his 
labour  12let there be none to extend 
kindness unto him  
neither let there be any to be 
gracious unto his fatherless 
children  
13let his posterity be cut off  
in the g eneration following let their 
name be blotted out  
14let the iniquity of his fathers be 
brought to remembrance unto the 
lord  
and let not the sin of his mother be 
blotted out  
15let them be before the lord 
continually  
that he may cut off the memory of 
them from the earth  
16because that he remembered not to 
do kindness  
but persecuted the poor and needy 
man  
and the broken in heart he was 
ready to slay  
17yea he loved cursing and it came 
unto him  
and he delighted not in blessing 
and it is far from  him 
18he clothed himself also with 
cursing as with his raiment  
and it is come into his inward parts 
like water  
and like oil into his bones  
19let it be unto him as the garment 
which he putteth on  
and for the girdle wherewith he is 
girded continuall y

from the lord  109 psalms

soul  
21but thou o g od the lord deal 
with me for thy names sake  
because thy mercy is good deliver 
thou me  
22for i am poor and needy  
and my heart is wound ed within 
me 
23i am gone like the shadow when it 
lengtheneth  
i am shaken off as the locust  
24my knees totter through fasting  
and my flesh is lean and hath no 
fatness  
25i am become also a taunt unto 
them

o save me according to thy mercy  
27that they may know that this is 
thy hand  
that thou lord hast done it  
28let them curse but bless thou

shame but thy servant shall 
rejoice

with confusion  
and shall put on their own shame as 
a robe

dark sayings   
 
7the fear of the lord is the

but the foolish despise wisdom and 
discipline   
 
8hear  my son  the instruction of thy 
father   
and forsake not the teaching of thy 
mother   
9for they shall be a chaplet of grace 
unto thy head   
and chai ns about thy neck   
 
10my son  if sinners entice thee   consent thou not   
11if they say  come with us   
let us lie in wait for blood   
let us lurk for the innocent without 
cause   
12let us swallow them up alive as 
the grave   
and whole  as those that go down 
into the pit   
13we shall find all precious 
substance   
we shall fill our houses with spoil

15my son  walk not thou in the way 
with them   
restrain thy foot from their path   
16for their feet run to evil   
a nd they make haste to shed blood   
17for in vain the net is spread  
in the eyes of any bird

20wisdom crieth aloud in the streets   
she uttereth her voice in the broad 
places   
21she calleth at the head of the noisy 
streets   1 proverbs  
1051  
 at the entrances of the gates  in the 
city she uttereth her words   
22how long  ye thoughtless  will ye 
love thoughtlessness   
and how long will scorners delight 
them in scorning   
and fools hate knowledge  
23turn you at my reproof   
behold  i will pour out my spirit 
unto you   
i will make known my words unto 
you  
24because i have called  and ye 
refused   
i have stretched out my hand  and 
no man attended   
25but ye have set at nought all my 
counsel   
and would none of my reproof   
26i also  in your calamity  will laugh   
i will mock when your dread 
cometh   
27when your dread cometh as a 
storm   
and your calamity cometh on as a 
whirlwind   
when trouble and distress come 
upon you   
28then will they call me  but i will 
not answer   
they will seek me earnestly  but 
they shall not find me   
29for that they hated knowledge   
and did not choose t he fear of the 
lord  
30they would none of my counsel   
they despised all my reproof   
31therefore shall they eat of the fruit 
of their own way   and be filled with their own 
devices   
32for the waywardness of the 
thoughtless shall slay them   
and the conf idence of fools shall 
destroy them   
33but whoso hearkeneth unto me 
shall dwell securely   
and shall be quiet without fear of 
evil  
 
my son  if thou wilt receive my 
 words   
and lay up my commandments with 
thee  
2so that thou make thine ear attend 
unto wisdom   
and thy heart incline to 
discernment   
3yea if thou call for understanding   
and lift up thy voice for 
discernment   
4if thou seek her as silver   
and search for her as for hid 
treasures   
5then shalt thou understand the fear 
of the lord  
and find the knowledge of god   
6for the lord giveth wisdom   
out of his mouth cometh 
knowledge and discernment   
7he layeth up sound wisdom for the 
upright   
he is a shield to them that walk in 
integrity   
8that he may guard the paths of 
justice   
and preserv e the way of his godly 
ones  2 proverbs  
1052  
 9then shalt thou understand 
righteousness and justice   
and equity  yea every good path   
10for wisdom shall enter into thy 
heart   
and knowledge shall be pleasant 
unto thy soul   
11discretion shall watch over thee   
discernm ent shall guard thee   
12to deliver thee from the way of 
evil  
from the men that speak froward 
things   
13who leave the paths of 
uprightness   
to walk in the ways of darkness   
14who rejoice to do evil   
and delight in the frowardness of 
evil  
15who are crooked in their ways   
and perverse in their paths   
16to deliver thee from the strange 
woman   
even from the alien woman that 
maketh smooth her words   
17that forsaketh the lord of her 
youth   
and forgetteth the covenant of her 
god  
18for her house sink eth down unto 
death   
and her paths unto the shades   
19none that go unto her return   
neither do they attain unto the paths 
of life   
20that thou mayest walk in the way 
of good men   
and keep the paths of the righteous   21for the upright shall dwell in t he 
land  
and the whole hearted shall remain 
in it  
22but the wicked shall be cut off 
from the land   
and the faithless shall be plucked 
up out of it   
 
my son  forget not my teaching   
but let thy heart keep my 
 commandments   
2for length of days  and years of 
life  
and peace  will they add to thee   
3let not kindness and truth forsake 
thee  
bind them about thy neck  write 
them upon the table of thy heart   
4so shalt thou find grace and good 
favour  
in the sight of god and man   
 
5trust in the lord with all thy heart   
and lean not upon thine own 
understanding   
6in all thy ways acknowledge him   
and he will direct thy paths   
 
7be not wise in thine own eyes   
fear the lord and depart from evil   
8it shall be health to thy navel   
and marrow to thy bo nes  
 
9honour the lord with thy 
substance   
and with the first fruits of all thine 
increase   3 proverbs  
1053  
 10so shall thy barns be filled with 
plenty   
and thy vats shall overflow with 
new wine   
11my son  despise not the chastening 
of the lord  
neither spurn thou hi s correction   
12for whom the lord loveth he 
correcteth   
even as a father the son in whom he 
delighteth   
 
13happy is the man that findeth 
wisdom   
and the man that obtaineth 
understanding   
14for the merchandise of it is better 
than the merchandise of si lver  
and the gain thereof than fine gold   
15she is more precious than rubies   
and all the things thou canst desire 
are not to be compared unto her   
16length of days is in her right hand   
in her left hand are riches and 
honour   
17her ways are ways of  
pleasantness   
and all her paths are peace   
18she is a tree of life to them that lay 
hold upon her   
and happy is every one that holdest 
her fast   
 
19the lord by wisdom founded the 
earth   
by understanding he established the 
heavens   
20by his knowledge  the depths were 
broken up   and the skies drop down the dew   
 
21my son  let not them depart from 
thine eyes   
keep sound wisdom and discretion   
22so shall they be life unto thy soul   
and grace to thy neck   
23then shalt thou walk in thy way 
securely   
and thou shalt not dash thy foot   
24when thou liest down  thou shalt 
not be afraid   
yea thou shalt lie down  and thy 
sleep shall be sweet   
 
25be not afraid of sudden terror   
neither of the destruction of the 
wicked  when it cometh   
26for the lord will be thy 
confidence   
and will keep thy foot from being 
caught   
 
27withhold not good from him to 
whom it is due   
when it is in the power of thy hand 
to do it   
28say not unto thy neighbour  go 
and come again   
and to morrow i will give  when 
thou hast  it by thee   
 
29devise not evil against thy 
neighbour   
seeing he dwelleth securely by thee   
30strive not with a man without 
cause   
if he have done thee no harm   
 proverbs  
1054  
 31envy thou not the man of violence   
and choose none of his ways   
32for the perverse is  an abomination 
to the lord  
but his counsel is with the upright   
 
33the curse of the lord is in the 
house of the wicked   
but he blesseth the habitation of the 
righteous   
34if it concerneth the scorners  he 
scorneth them   
but unto the humble he giveth  
grace   
35the wise shall inherit honour   
but as for the fools  they carry away 
shame   
 
hear  ye children  the instruction 
 of a father   
and attend to know understanding   
2for i give you good doctrine   
forsake ye not my teaching   
3for i was a son u nto my father   
tender and an only one in the sight 
of my mother   
4and he taught me  and said unto 
me  
let thy heart hold fast my words   
keep my commandments  and live   
5get wisdom  get understanding   
forget not  neither decline from the 
words of my mouth   
6forsake her not  and she will 
preserve thee   
love her  and she will keep thee   
7the beginning of wisdom is  get 
wisdom   yea with all thy getting get 
understanding   
8extol her  and she will exalt thee   
she will bring thee to honour  when 
thou dost embrace her   
9she will give to thy head a chaplet 
of grace   
a crown of glory will she bestow on 
thee  
10hear  o my son  and receive my 
sayings   
and the years of thy life shall be 
many   
11i have taught thee in the way of 
wisdom   
i have led thee  in paths of 
uprightness   
12when thou goest  thy step shall not 
be straitened   
and if thou runnest  thou shalt not 
stumble   
13take fast hold of instruction  let 
her not go   
keep her  for she is thy life   
 
14enter not into the path of the 
wicked   
and walk not in the way of evil 
men  
15avoid it  pass not by it   
turn from it  and pass on   
16for they sleep not  except they 
have done evil   
and their sleep is taken away  
unless they cause some to fall   
17for they eat the bread of 
wickedness   
and drink  the wine of violence   4 proverbs  
1055  
 18but the path of the righteous is as 
the light of dawn   
that shineth more and more unto 
the perfect day   
19the way of the wicked is as 
darkness   
they know not at what they 
stumble   
 
20my son  attend to my words   
incline thine ear unto my sayings   
21let them not depart from thine 
eyes  
keep them in the midst of thy heart   
22for they are life unto those that 
find them   
and health to all their flesh   
23above all that thou guardest keep 
thy heart   
for out of it are the issues  of life   
24put away from thee a froward 
mouth   
and perverse lips put far from thee   
25let thine eyes look right on   
and let thine eyelids look straight 
before thee   
26make plain the path of thy feet   
and let all thy ways be established   
27turn not to the right hand nor to 
the left   
remove thy foot from evil   
 
my son  attend unto my wisdom   
incline thine ear to my 
 understanding   
2that thou mayest preserve 
discretion   
and that thy lips may keep 
knowledge   3for the lips of a strange woman 
drop honey   
and her mouth is smoother than oil   
4but her end is bitter as wormwood   
sharp as a two edged sword   
5her feet go down to death   
her steps take hold on the nether 
world   
6lest she should walk the even path 
of life   
her ways wander  but she kn oweth 
it not   
 
7now therefore  o ye children  
hearken unto me   
and depart not from the words of 
my mouth   
8remove thy way far from her   
and come not nigh the door of her 
house   
9lest thou give thy vigour unto 
others   
and thy years unto the cruel   
10lest strangers be filled with thy 
strength   
and thy labours be in the house of 
an alien   
11and thou moan  when thine end 
cometh   
when thy flesh and thy body are 
consumed   
12and say  how have i hated 
instruction   
and my heart despised reproof   
13neither have i hearkened to the 
voice of my teachers   
nor inclined mine ear to them that 
instructed me   
14i was well nigh in all evil  5 proverbs  
1056  
 in the midst of the congregation and 
assembly   
 
15drink waters out of thine own 
cistern   
and running waters out of thine  
own well   
16let thy springs be dispersed 
abroad   
and courses of water in the streets   
17let them be only thine own   
and not strangers with thee   
18let thy fountain be blessed   
and have joy of the wife of thy 
youth   
19a lovely hind and a graceful do e  
let her breasts satisfy thee at all 
times   
with her love be thou ravished 
always   
20why then wilt thou  my son  be 
ravished with a strange woman   
and embrace the bosom of an alien   
 
21for the ways of man are before the 
eyes of the lord  
and he mak eth even all his paths   
22his own iniquities shall ensnare 
the wicked   
and he shall be holden with the 
cords of his sin   
23he shall die for lack of instruction   
and in the greatness of his folly he 
shall reel   
 
my son  if thou art become surety 
 for thy neighbour   
if thou hast struck thy hands for a 
stranger   2thou art snared by the words of thy 
mouth   
thou art caught by the words of thy 
mouth   
3do this now  my son  and deliver 
thyself   
seeing thou art come into the hand 
of thy neighbour   
go humble thyself  and urge thy 
neighbour   
4give not sleep to thine eyes  
 nor slumber to thine eyelids   
5deliver thyself as a gazelle from 
the hand of the hunter   
and as a bird from the hand of the 
fowler   
 
6go to the ant  thou sluggard   
consider her w ays and be wise   
7which having no chief   
overseer  or ruler   
8provideth her bread in the summer   
and gatherest her food in the 
harvest   
9how long wilt thou sleep  o 
sluggard   
when wilt thou arise out of thy 
sleep   
10yet a little sleep  a little sl umber   
a little folding of the hands to 
sleep  
11so shall thy poverty come as a 
runner   
and thy want as an armed man   
 
12a base person  a man of iniquity   
is he that walketh with a froward 
mouth   6 proverbs  
1057  
 13that winketh with his eyes  that 
scrapeth with his f eet  
that pointeth with his fingers   
14frowardness is in his heart  he 
deviseth evil continually   
he soweth discord   
15therefore shall his calamity come 
suddenly   
on a sudden shall he be broken  and 
that without remedy   
 
16there are six things which the 
lord hateth   
yea seven which are an 
abomination unto him   
17haughty eyes  a lying tongue   
and hands that shed innocent blood   
18a heart that deviseth wicked 
thoughts   
feet that are swift in running to evil   
19a false witness that breatheth out 
lies  
and he that soweth discord among 
brethren   
 
20my son  keep the commandment 
of thy father   
and forsake not the teaching of thy 
mother   
21bind them continually upon thy 
heart   
tie them about thy neck   
22when thou walkest  it shall lead 
thee  
when thou liest down  it shall watch 
over thee   
and when thou awakest  it shall talk 
with thee   23for the commandment is a lamp  
and the teaching is light   
and reproofs of instruction are the 
way of life   
24to keep thee from the evil woman   
from the smoot hness of the alien 
tongue   
25lust not after her beauty in thy 
heart   
neither let her captivate thee with 
her eyelids   
26for on account of a harlot a man is 
brought to a loaf of bread   
but the adulteress hunteth for the 
precious life   
27can a man take fire in his bosom   
and his clothes not be burned   
28or can one walk upon hot coals   
and his feet not be scorched   
29so he that goeth in to his 
neighbour s wife   
whosoever toucheth her shall not go 
unpunished   
30men do not despise a thief  if he 
steal  
to satisfy his soul when he is 
hungry   
31but if he be found  he must restore 
sevenfold   
he must give all the substance of his 
house   
32he that committeth adultery with a 
woman lacketh understanding   
he doeth it that would destroy his 
own soul   
33wou nds and dishonour shall he 
get  
and his reproach shall not be wiped 
away   proverbs  
1058  
 34for jealousy is the rage of a man   
and he will not spare in the day of 
vengeance   
35he will not regard any ransom   
neither will he rest content  though 
thou givest many gifts   
 
my son  keep my words   
and lay up my commandments 
 with thee   
2keep my commandments and live   
and my teaching as the apple of 
thine eye   
3bind them upon thy fingers   
write them upon the table of thy 
heart   
4say unto wisdom  thou art my 
sister   
and call understanding thy 
kinswoman   
5that they may keep thee from the 
strange woman   
from the alien woman that maketh 
smooth her words   
 
6for at the window of my house  
i looked forth through my lattice   
7and i beheld among the 
thoughtless ones   
i discerned among the youths   
a young man void of understanding   
8passing through the street near her 
corner   
and he went the way to her house   
9in the twilight  in the evening of the 
day  
in the blackness of night and the 
darkness   10and behold  there met him a 
woman  
with the attire of a harlot  and wily 
of heart   
11she is riotous and rebellious   
her feet abide not in her house   
12now she is in the streets  now in 
the broad places   
and lieth in wait at every corner   
13so she caught him  and kis sed 
him  
and with an impudent face she said 
unto him   
14sacrifices of peace offerings were 
due from me   
this day have i paid my vows   
15therefore came i forth to meet 
thee  
to seek thy face  and i have found 
thee  
16i have decked my couch with 
cover lets  
with striped cloths of the yarn of 
egypt   
17i have perfumed my bed  
with myrrh  aloes  and cinnamon   
18come  let us take our fill of love 
until the morning   
let us solace ourselves with loves   
19for my husband is not at home   
he is gone a long journey   
20he hath taken the bag of money 
with him   
he will come home at the full 
moon   
 
21with her much fair speech she 
causeth him to yield   7 proverbs  
1059  
 with the blandishment of her lips 
she enticeth him away   
22he goeth after her straightway   
as an ox that g oeth to the slaughter   
or as one in fetters to the correction 
of the fool   
23till an arrow strike through his 
liver  
as a bird hasteneth to the snare   
and knoweth not that it is at the cost 
of his life   
 
24now therefore  o ye children  
hearken unto me   
and attend to the words of my 
mouth   
25let not thy heart decline to her 
ways   
go not astray in her paths   
26for she hath cast down many 
wounded   
yea a mighty host are all her slain   
27her house is the way to the nether 
world   
going down to the ch ambers of 
death   
 
doth not wisdom call   
and understanding put forth her  
 voice   
2in the top of high places by the 
way  
where the paths meet  she standeth   
3beside the gates  at the entry of the 
city  
at the coming in at the doors  she 
crieth aloud   
4unto you  o men  i call   
and my voice is to the sons of men   5o ye thoughtless  understand 
prudence   
and ye fools  be ye of an 
understanding heart   
6hear  for i will speak excellent 
things   
and the opening of my lips shall be 
right things   
7for my mouth shall utter truth   
and wickedness is an abomination 
to my lips   
8all the words of my mouth are in 
righteousness   
there is nothing perverse or 
crooked in them   
9they are all plain to him that 
understandeth   
and right to them that find 
knowled ge  
10receive my instruction  and not 
silver   
and knowledge rather than choice 
gold  
11for wisdom is better than rubies   
and all things desirable are not to 
be compared unto her   
12i wisdom dwell with prudence   
and find out knowledge of devices   
13the fear of the lord is to hate evil   
pride and arrogancy  and the evil 
way  
and the froward mouth  do i hate   
14counsel is mine  and sound 
wisdom   
i am understanding  power is mine   
15by me kings reign

the earth   
17i love them that love me   
and those that seek me earnestly 
shall find me   
18riches and honour are with me   
yea enduring riches and 
righteousness   
19my fruit is better than gold  yea 
than fine gol d  
and my produce than choice silver   
20i walk in the way of righteousness   
in the midst of the paths of justice   
21that i may cause those that love 
me to inherit substance   
and that i may fill their treasuries   
 
22the lord made me as the 
beginning o f his way   
the first of his works of old   
23i was set up from everlasting  from 
the beginning   
or ever the earth was   
24when there were no depths  i was 
brought forth   
when there were no fountains 
abounding with water   
25before the mountains were set tled  
before the hills was i brought forth   
26while as yet he had not made the 
earth  nor the fields   
nor the beginning of the dust of the 
world   
27when he established the heavens  
i was there   
when he set a circle upon the face 
of the deep   
28when h e made firm the skies 
above   when the fountains of the deep 
showed their might   
29when he gave to the sea his 
decree   
that the waters should not 
transgress his commandment   
when he appointed the foundations 
of the earth   
30then i was by him  as a nurs ling  
and i was daily all delight   
playing always before him   
31playing in his habitable earth   
and my delights are with the sons 
of men   
 
32now therefore  ye children  
hearken unto me   
for happy are they that keep my 
ways   
33hear instruction  and b e wise   
and refuse it not   
34happy is the man that hearkeneth

them both   
 
23these also are  sayings of the wise   
 
to have respect of persons in 
judgment is not good   
24he that saith unto the wicked

nettles   
and the stone wall thereof was 
broken down

these also are proverbs of 
solomon  which the men of 
hezekiah king of judah copied out   
 
2it is the glory of god to conceal a 
thing  but the glory of kings is to 
search out a  matter   
3the heaven for height  and the 
earth for depth  and the heart of 
kings is unsearchable   
 
4take away the dross from the 
silver  and there cometh forth a 
vessel for the refiner   5take away the wicked from before 
the king  and his throne shall be  
established in righteousness   
 
6glorify not thyself in the presence 
of the king  and stand not in the 
place of great men   
7for better is it that it be said unto 
thee come up hither  than that 
thou shouldest be put lower in the 
presence of the prince  whom 
thine eyes have seen   
 
8go not forth hastily to strive  lest 
thou know not what to do in the 
end thereof  when thy neighbour 
hath put thee to shame   
9debate thy cause with thy 
neighbour  but reveal not the 
secret of another   
10lest he that heareth  it revile thee

11a word fitly spoken

ornament of fine gold   
so is a wise reprover upon an 
obedient ear   
 
13as the cold of snow in the ti me of 
harvest   
so is a faithful messenger to him 
that sendeth him   
for he refresheth the soul of his 
master

16hast thou found honey  eat so 
much as is sufficient for thee   
lest thou be filled therewith  and 
vomit it   
 
17let thy foot be seldom in thy 
neighbour s house   
lest he be sated with thee  and hate 
thee  
 
18as a maul  and a s word  and a 
sharp arrow   
so is a man that beareth false 
witness against his neighbour   
 
19confidence in an unfaithful man in 
time of trouble  
is like a broken tooth  and a foot out 
of joint   
 
20as one that taketh off a garment in 
cold weather  and as vi negar upon 
nitre  
so is he that singeth songs to a 
heavy heart   
 
21if thine enemy be hungry  give 
him bread to eat   
and if he be thirsty  give him water 
to drink   22for thou wilt heap coals of fire 
upon his head   
and the lord will reward thee   
 
23the north wind bringeth forth rain   
and a backbiting tongue an angry 
countenance   
 
24it is better to dwell in a corner of

contentious woman   
 
25as cold waters to a faint soul   
so is good news from a far coun try  
 
26as a troubled fountain  and a 
corrupted spring   
so is a righteous man that giveth 
way before the wicked   
 
27it is not good to eat much honey   
so for men to search out their own 
glory is not glory   
 
28like a city broken down and 
without a wall   
so is he whose spirit is without 
restraint   
 
as snow in summer  and as

dainty morsels   
and they go down into the 
innermost parts of the body   
 
23burning lips and a wicked heart  
are like an earthen vessel overlaid

24he that hateth dissembleth with his 
lips  
but he layeth up deceit within him   
25when he speaketh fair   
believe him not   
for there are seven abominations in 
his heart   
26though his hatred be concealed 
with deceit   
his wickednes s shall be revealed

17the eye that mocketh at his father   
and despiseth to obey his mother   
the ravens of the valley shall pick it 
out  
and the young vultures shall eat it    
18there are three things which are 
too wonderful for me   
yea four which i know not   
19the way of an eagle in the air   
the way of a serpent upon a rock   
the wa y of a ship in the midst of the 
sea  
and the way of a man with a young 
woman   
20so is the way of an adulterous 
woman   
she eateth  and wipeth her mouth   
and saith  i have done no 
wickedness   
 
21for three things the earth doth 
quake   
and for four it cannot endure   
22for a servant when he reigneth   
and a churl when he is filled with 
food  
23for an odious woman when she is 
married   
and a handmaid that is heir to her 
mistress   
 
24there are four things which are 
little upon the earth   
but they are e xceeding wise   
25the ants are a people not strong   
yet they provide their food in the 
summer   
26the rock badgers are but a feeble 
folk  
yet make they their houses in the 
crags   
27the locusts have no king   proverbs  
1098  
 yet go they forth all of them by 
bands   
28the spider thou canst take with the 
hands   
yet is she in kings palaces   
 
29there are three things which are 
stately in their march   
yea four which are stately in going   
30the lion  which is mightiest 
among beasts   
and turneth not away for any   
31the g reyhound  the he goat also   
and the king  against whom there is 
no rising up   
 
32if thou hast done foolishly in 
lifting up thyself   
or if thou hast planned devices  lay 
thy hand upon thy mouth   
33for the churning of milk bringeth 
forth curd   
and the w ringing of the nose 
bringeth forth blood   
so the forcing of wrath bringeth 
forth strife

nor thy ways to that which

job  
 
there was a man in the land of 
uz whose name was job  and 
that man was whole hearted and 
upright  and one that fear ed god  and 
shunned evil  2and there were born 
unto him seven sons and three 
daughters  3his possessions also were 
seven thousand sheep  and three 
thousand camels  and five hundred 
yoke of oxen  and five hundred she 
asses  and a very great household  so 
that this man was the greatest of all the 
children of the east  4and his sons used 
to go and hold a feast in the house of 
each one upon his day  and they would 
send and invite their three sisters to eat 
and to drink with them  5and it was so  
when the days o f their feasting were 
gone about  that job sent and 
sanctified them  and rose up early in 
the morning  and offered burnt 
offerings according to the number of 
them all  for job said  it may be that 
my sons have sinned  and blasphemed 
god in their hearts  thus did job 
continually   
6now it fell upon a day  that the 
sons of god came to present 
themselves before the lord and asatan 
came also among them  7and the lord 
said unto satan  whence comest 
thou then satan answered the lord 
                                                      
a that is the adversary  and said  from going t o and fro in the 
earth  and from walking up and down 
in it 8and the lord said unto satan  
hast thou considered my servant job  
that there is none like him in the earth  
a whole hearted and an upright man  
one that feareth god  and shunneth 
evil 9then satan answered the lord 
and said  doth job fear god for 
nought  10hast not thou made a hedge 
about him  and about his house  and 
about all that he hath  on every side  
thou hast blessed the work of his 
hands  and his possessions are 
increased in the land  11but put forth 
thy hand now  and touch all that he 
hath surely he will blaspheme thee to 
thy face  12and the lord said unto 
satan  behold  all that he hath is in 
thy power  only upon himself put not 
forth thy hand  so satan went forth 
from the prese nce of the lord  
13and it fell on a day when his sons 
and his daughters were eating and 
drinking wine in their eldest brother s 
house  14that there came a messenger 
unto job  and said  the oxen were 
plowing  and the asses feeding beside 
them  15and the s abeans made a raid  
and took them away  yea they have 
slain the servants with the edge of the 
sword  and i only am escaped alone to 
tell thee  16while he was yet speaking  
there came also another  and said  a 1 job 
1101  
 fire of god is fallen from heaven  and 
hath burned up the sheep  and the 
servants  and consumed them  and i 
only am escaped alone to tell thee  
17while he was yet speaking  there 
came also another  and said  the 
chaldeans set themselves in three 
bands  and fell upon the camels  and 
have taken them  away  yea and slain 
the servants with the edge of the 
sword  and i only am escaped alone to 
tell thee  18while he was yet speaking  
there came also another  and said  
thy sons and thy daughters were 
eating and drinking wine in their eldest 
brother s house 19and behold  there 
came a great wind from across the 
wilderness  and smote the four corners 
of the house  and it fell upon the young 
people  and they are dead  and i only 
am escaped alone to tell thee   
20then job arose  and rent his 
mantle  and sh aved his head  and fell 
down upon the ground  and 
worshipped  21and he said   
naked came i out of my mother s 
womb   
and naked shall i return thither   
the lord gave and the lord hath 
taken away   
blessed be the name of the lord  
22for all this job sinne d not  nor 
ascribed aught unseemly to god   
again it fell upon a day  that the 
sons of god came to present 
themselves before the lord and satan 
came also among them to present 
himself before the lord 2and the 
lord said unto satan  from whence comest t hou and satan answered the 
lord and said  from going to and fro 
in the earth  and from walking up and 
down in it  3and the lord said unto 
satan  hast thou considered my 
servant job  that there is none like him 
in the earth  a whole hearted and an 
upright man  one that feareth god  and 
shunneth evil  and he still holdeth fast 
his integrity  although thou didst move 
me against him  to destroy him 
without cause  4and satan answered 
the lord and said  skin for skin  yea 
all that a man hath will he giv e for his 
life 5but put forth thy hand now  and 
touch his bone and his flesh  surely he 
will blaspheme thee to thy face  
6and the lord said unto satan  
behold  he is in thy hand  only spare 
his life   
7so satan went forth from the 
presence of the lord and smote job 
with sore boils from the sole of his 
foot even unto his crown  8and he took 
him a potsherd to scrape himself 
therewith  and he sat among the ashes  
9then said his wife unto him  dost 
thou still hold fast thine integrity  
blaspheme god  and die 10but he said 
unto her  thou speakest as one of the 
impious women speaketh  what  shall 
we receive good at the hand of god  
and shall we not receive evil  for all 
this did not job sin with his lips   
11now when job s three friends 
heard of all this  evil that was come 
upon him  they came every one from 
his own place  eliphaz the temanite  
and bildad the shuhite  and zophar the 2 job 
1102  
 naamathite  and they made an 
appointment together to come to 
bemoan him and to comfort him  
12and when they lifted up their e yes 
afar off  and knew him not  they lifted 
up their voice  and wept  and they rent 
every one his mantle  and threw dust 
upon their heads toward heaven  13so 
they sat down with him upon the 
ground seven days and seven nights  
and none spoke a word unto him  for 
they saw that his grief was very great   
 
after this opened job his mouth  
and cursed his day  2and job 
spoke  and said   
3let the day perish wherein i was 
born  
and the night wherein it was said  
a man child is brought forth   
4let that day be darkness   
let not god inquire after it from 
above   
neither let the light shine upon it   
5let darkness and the shadow of 
death claim it for their own   
let a cloud dwell upon it   
let all that maketh black the day 
terrify it   
6as for that night  let thi ck darkness 
seize upon it   
let it not rejoice among the days of 
the year   
let it not come into the number of 
the months   
7lo let that night be desolate   
let no joyful voice come therein   
8let them curse it that curse the day   who are ready to rouse up 
leviathan   
9let the stars of the twilight thereof 
be dark   
let it look for light  but have none   
neither let it behold the eyelids of 
the morning   
10because it shut not up the doors of 
my mother s womb   
nor hid trouble from mine eyes   
 
11why die d i not from the womb   
why did i not perish at birth   
12why did the knees receive me   
and wherefore the breasts  that i 
should suck   
13for now should i have lain still 
and been quiet   
i should have slept  then had i been 
at rest  
14with kings and coun sellors of the 
earth   
who built up waste places for 
themselves   
15or with princes that had gold   
who filled their houses with silver   
16or as a hidden untimely birth i had 
not been   
as infants that never saw light   
17there the wicked cease from 
troub ling  
and there the weary are at rest   
18there the prisoners are at ease 
together   
they hear not the voice of the 
taskmaster   
19the small and great are there 
alike   3 job 
1103  
 and the servant is free from his 
master   
 
20wherewith is light given to him 
that is i n misery   
and life unto the bitter in soul   
21who long for death  but it cometh 
not  
and dig for it more than for hid 
treasures   
22who rejoice unto exultation   
and are glad  when they can find 
the grave   
23to a man whose way is hid   
and whom god ha th hedged in   
24for my sighing cometh instead of 
my food   
and my roarings are poured out like 
water   
25for the thing which i did fear is 
come upon me   
and that which i was afraid of hath 
overtaken me   
26i was not at ease  neither was i 
quiet   
neither  had i rest  but trouble came   
 
then answered eliphaz the 
temanite  and said   
2if one venture a word unto thee  
wilt thou be weary   
but who can withhold himself from 
speaking   
3behold  thou hast instructed many   
and thou hast strengthened the 
weak h ands  
4thy words have upholden him that 
was falling   and thou hast strengthened the 
feeble knees   
5but now it is come upon thee  and 
thou art weary   
it toucheth thee  and thou art 
affrighted   
6is not thy fear of god thy 
confidence   
and thy hope the i ntegrity of thy 
ways   
7remember  i pray thee  who ever 
perished  being innocent   
or where were the upright cut off   
8according as i have seen  they that 
plow iniquity   
and sow mischief  reap the same   
9by the breath of god they perish   
and by the bla st of his anger are 
they consumed   
10the lion roareth  and the fierce 
lion howleth  
yet the teeth of the young lions are 
broken   
11the old lion perisheth for lack of 
prey  
and the whelps of the lioness are 
scattered abroad   
 
12now a word was secretly b rought 
to me   
and mine ear received a whisper 
thereof   
13in thoughts from the visions of the 
night   
when deep sleep falleth on men   
14fear came upon me  and 
trembling   
and all my bones were made to 
shake   4 job 
1104  
 15then a spirit passed before my 
face  
that made the hair of my flesh to 
stand up   
16it stood still  but i could not 
discern the appearance thereof   
a form was before mine eyes  i 
heard a still voice   
17shall mortal man be just before 
god  
shall a man be pure before his 
maker   
18behold  he put teth no trust in his 
servants   
and his angels he chargeth with 
folly   
19how much more them that dwell 
in houses of clay   
whose foundation is in the dust  
who are crushed before the moth   
20betwixt morning and evening they 
are shattered   
they perish fo r ever without any 
regarding it   
21is not their tent cord plucked up 
within them   
they die  and that without wisdom   
 
call now  is there any that will 
 answer thee   
and to which of the holy ones wilt 
thou turn   
2for anger killeth the foolish man   
and envy slayeth the silly one   
3i have seen the foolish taking root   
but suddenly i beheld his habitation 
cursed   
4his children are far from safety   and are crushed in the gate  with 
none to deliver them   
5whose harvest the hungry eateth 
up  
and tak eth it even out of the thorns  
and the snare gapeth for their 
substance   
6for affliction cometh not forth 
from the dust   
neither doth trouble spring out of 
the ground   
7but man is born unto trouble   
as the sparks fly upward   
 
8but as for me  i would s eek unto 
god  
and unto god would i commit my 
cause   
9who doeth great things and 
unsearchable   
marvellous things without number   
10who giveth rain upon the earth   
and sendeth waters upon the fields   
11so that he setteth up on high those 
that are low   
and those that mourn are exalted to 
safety   
12he frustrateth the devices of the 
crafty   
so that their hands can perform 
nothing substantial   
13he taketh the wise in their own 
craftiness   
and the counsel of the wily is 
carried headlong   
14they meet wi th darkness in the 
daytime  
and grope at noonday as in the 
night   5 job 
1105  
 15but he saveth from the sword of 
their mouth   
even the needy from the hand of the 
mighty   
16so the poor hath hope   
and iniquity stoppeth her mouth   
 
17behold  happy is the man whom 
god correcteth   
therefore despise not thou the 
chastening of the almighty   
18for he maketh sore  and bindeth 
up  
he woundeth  and his hands make 
whole   
19he will deliver thee in six 
troubles   
yea in seven there shall no evil 
touch thee   
20in famine h e will redeem thee 
from death   
and in war from the power of the 
sword   
21thou shalt be hid from the scourge 
of the tongue   
neither shalt thou be afraid of 
destruction when it cometh   
22at destruction and famine thou 
shalt laugh   
neither shalt thou be afraid of the 
beasts of the earth   
23for thou shalt be in league with 
the stones of the field   
and the beasts of the field shall be 
at peace with thee   
24and thou shalt know that thy tent 
is in peace   
and thou shalt visit thy habitation  
and shalt miss  nothing   25thou shalt know also that thy seed 
shall be great   
and thine offspring as the grass of 
the earth   
26thou shalt come to thy grave in a 
ripe age   
like as a shock of corn cometh in in 
its season   
27lo this  we have searched it   
so it is  hear it and know thou it for 
thy good   
 
then job answered and said   
2oh that my vexation were but 
 weighed   
and my calamity laid in the 
balances altogether   
3for now it would be heavier than 
the sand of the seas  t 
herefore are my words broken   
4for t he arrows of the almighty are 
within me   
the poison whereof my spirit 
drinketh up   
the terrors of god do set 
themselves in array against me   
5doth the wild ass bray when he 
hath grass   
or loweth the ox over his fodder   
6can that which hath no savour b e 
eaten without salt   
or is there any taste in the juice of 
mallows   
7my soul refuseth to touch them   
they are as the sickness of my flesh   
 
8oh that i might have my request   
and that god would grant me the 
thing that i long for   6 job 
1106  
 9even that it would please god to 
crush me   
that he would let loose his hand  
and cut me off   
10then should i yet have comfort   
yea i would exult in pain  though 
he spare not   
for i have not denied the words of 
the holy one   
 
11what is my strength  that i should 
wait  
and what is mine end  that i should 
be patient   
12is my strength the strength of 
stones   
or is my flesh of brass   
13is it that i have no help in me   
and that sound wisdom is driven 
quite from me   
 
14to him that is ready to faint 
kindness is due from h is friend   
even to him that forsaketh the fear 
of the almighty   
15my brethren have dealt deceitfully 
as a brook   
as the channel of brooks that 
overflow   
16which are black by reason of the 
ice  
and wherein the snow hideth itself   
17what time they wax warm  they 
vanish   
when it is hot  they are consumed 
out of their place   
18the paths of their way do wind   
they go up into the waste  and are 
lost  19the caravans of tema looked   
the companies of sheba waited for 
them   
20they were ashamed because the y 
had hoped   
they came thither  and were 
confounded   
21for now ye are become his   
ye see a terror  and are afraid   
22did i say  give unto me   
or offer a present for me of your 
substance   
23or deliver me from the 
adversary s hand   
or redeem  me from the hand of 
the oppressors   
 
24teach me  and i will hold my 
peace   
and cause me to understand 
wherein i have erred   
25how forcible are words of 
uprightness   
but what doth your arguing argue   
26do ye hold words to be an 
argument   
but the spe eches of one that is 
desperate to be wind   
27yea ye would cast lots upon the 
fatherless   
and dig a pit for your friend   
28now therefore be pleased to look 
upon me   
for surely i shall not lie to your 
face  
29return  i pray you  let there be no 
injusti ce  
yea return again  my cause is 
righteous   job 
1107  
 30is there injustice on my tongue   
cannot my taste discern crafty 
devices   
 
is there not a time of service to 
 man upon earth   
and are not his days like the days of 
a hireling   
2as a servant that eagerl y longeth 
for the shadow   
and as a hireling that looketh for his 
wages   
3so am i made to possess months 
of vanity   
and wearisome nights are appointed 
to me   
4when i lie down  i say  when 
shall i arise   
but the night is long  and i am full 
of tossing s to and fro unto the 
dawning of the day   
5my flesh is clothed with worms and 
clods of dust   
my skin closeth up and breaketh out 
afresh   
6my days are swifter than a 
weaver s shuttle   
and are spent without hope   
7o remember that my life is a 
breath   
mine eye shall no more see good   
8the eye of him that seeth me shall 
behold me no more   
while thine eyes are upon me  i am 
gone   
9as the cloud is consumed and 
vanisheth away   
so he that goeth down to the grave 
shall come up no more   10he shall return n o more to his 
house   
neither shall his place know him 
any more   
 
11therefore i will not refrain my 
mouth   
i will speak in the anguish of my 
spirit   
i will complain in the bitterness of 
my soul   
12am i a sea  or a sea monster   
that thou settest a watc h over me   
13when i say  my bed shall comfort 
me  
my couch shall ease my complaint   
14then thou scarest me with 
dreams   
and terrifiest me through visions   
15so that my soul chooseth 
strangling   
and death rather than these my 
bones   
16i loathe it  i shall not live alway   
let me alone  for my days are 
vanity   
17what is man  that thou shouldest 
magnify him   
and that thou shouldest set thy 
heart upon him   
18and that thou shouldest 
remember him every morning   
and try him every moment   
19how long w ilt thou not look away 
from me   
nor let me alone till i swallow down

 why hast thou set me as a mark for 
thee   
so that i am a burden to myself   
21and why dost thou not pardon m y 
transgression   
and take away mine iniquity   
for now shall i lie down in the dust   
and thou wilt seek me  but i shall 
not be   
 
then answered bildad the 
shuhite  and said   
2how long wilt thou speak these 
things   
seeing that the words of thy mouth 
are as a mighty wind   
3doth god pervert judgment   
or doth the almighty pervert 
justice   
4if thy children sinned against him   
he delivered them into the hand of 
their transgression   
5if thou wouldest seek earnestly 
unto god   
and make thy supplication t o the 
almighty   
6if thou wert pure and upright   
surely now he would awake for 
thee  
and make the habitation of thy 
righteousness prosperous   
7and though thy beginning was 
small   
yet thy end should greatly increase   
 
8for inquire  i pray thee  of the 
former generation   
and apply thyself to that which their 
fathers have searched out   9for we are but of yesterday  and 
know nothing   
because our days upon earth are a 
shadow  
10shall not they teach thee  and tell 
thee  
and utter words out of their heart   
11can the rush shoot up without 
mire  
can the reed grass grow without 
water   
12whilst it is yet in its greenness  
and not cut down   
it withereth before any other herb   
13so are the paths of all that forget 
god  
and the hope of the godless man 
shall  perish   
14whose confidence is gossamer   
and whose trust is a spider s web   
15he shall lean upon his house  but it 
shall not stand   
he shall hold fast thereby  but it 
shall not endure   
16he is green before the sun   
and his shoots go forth over his 
garden  
17his roots are wrapped about the 
heap   
he beholdeth the place of stones   
18if he be destroyed from his place   
then it shall deny him  i have not 
seen thee   
19behold  this is the joy of his way   
and out of the earth shall others 
spring   
20behold god will not cast away an 
innocent man   8 job 
1109  
 neither will he uphold the evil 
doers   
21till he fill thy mouth with 
laughter   
and thy lips with shouting   
22they that hate thee shall be 
clothed with shame   
and the tent of the wicked shall be 
no more   
 
then job answered and said   
2of a truth i know that it is so   
and how can man be just with god   
3if one should desire to contend with 
him  
he could not answer him one of a 
thousand   
4he is wise in heart  and mighty in 
strength   
who hath hardened hi mself against 
him and prospered   
5who removeth the mountains  and 
they know it not   
when he overturneth them in his 
anger   
6who shaketh the earth out of her 
place   
and the pillars thereof tremble   
7who commandeth the sun  and it 
riseth not   
and seal eth up the stars   
8who alone stretcheth out the 
heavens   
and treadeth upon the waves of the 
sea  
9who maketh the bear  orion  and 
the pleiades   
and the chambers of the south   10who doeth great things past 
finding out   
yea marvellous things without 
number   
11lo he goeth by me  and i see him 
not  
he passeth on also  but i perceive 
him not   
12behold  he snatcheth away  who 
can hinder him   
who will say unto him  what 
doest thou   
13god will not withdraw his anger   
the helpers of rahab did stoop 
under him   
 
14how much less shall i answer 
him  
and choose out my arguments with 
him  
15whom  though i were righteous  
yet would i not answer   
i would make supplication to him 
that contendeth with me   
16if i had called  and he had 
answered me   
yet wou ld i not believe that he 
would hearken unto my voice  
17he that would break me with a 
tempest   
and multiply my wounds without 
cause   
18that would not suffer me to take 
my breath   
but fill me with bitterness   
19if it be a matter of strength  lo he 
is mighty   
and if of justice  who will appoint 
me a time   9 job 
1110  
 20though i be righteous  mine own 
mouth shall condemn me   
though i be innocent  he shall 
prove me perverse   
21i am innocent i regard not 
myself   
i despise my life   
22it is all one therefore i say   
he destroyeth the innocent and the 
wicked   
23if the scourge slay suddenly   
he will mock at the calamity of the 
guiltless   
24the earth is given into the hand of 
the wicked   
he covereth the faces of the judges 
thereof   
if it be not he  who then is it   
25now my days are swifter than a 
runner   
they flee away  they see no good   
26they are passed away as the swift 
ships   
as the vulture that swoopeth on the 
prey  
27if i say  i will forget my 
complaint   
i will put off my sad countenance  
and be of goo d cheer   
28i am afraid of all my pains   
i know that thou wilt not hold me 
guiltless   
29i shall be condemned   
why then do i labour in vain   
30if i wash myself with snow water   
and make my hands never so clean   
31yet wilt thou plunge me in the 
ditch   and mine own clothes shall abhor 
me  
32for he is not a man  as i am  that i 
should answer him   
that we should come together in 
judgment   
33there is no arbiter betwixt us   
that might lay his hand upon us 
both  
34let him take his rod away from 
me  
and let not his terror make me 
afraid   
5then would i speak  and not fear 
him  
for i am not so with myself   
 
my soul is weary of my life   
i will give free course to my  
  complaint   
i will speak in the bitterness of my 
soul  
2i will say unto god  do not 
condemn me   
make me know wherefore thou 
contendest with me   
3is it good unto thee that thou 
shouldest oppress   
that thou shouldest despise the 
work of thy hands   
and shine upon the counsel of the 
wicked   
4hast thou eyes of flesh   
or seest thou as  man seeth   
5are thy days as the days of man   
or thy years as a man s days   
6that thou inquirest after mine 
iniquity   
and searchest after my sin   10 job 
1111  
 7although thou knowest that i shall 
not be condemned   
and there is none that can deliver 
out of thy hand   
8thy hands have framed me and 
fashioned me  
together round about  yet thou dost 
destroy me   
9remember  i beseech thee  that 
thou hast fashioned me as clay   
and wilt thou bring me into dust 
again   
10hast thou not poured me out as 
milk  
and curdled me  like cheese   
11thou hast clothed me with skin 
and flesh   
and knit me together with bones 
and sinews   
12thou hast granted me life and 
favour   
and thy providence hath preserved 
my spirit   
13yet these things thou didst hide in 
thy heart   
i know that th is is with thee   
14if i sin  then thou markest me   
and thou wilt not acquit me from 
mine iniquity   
15if i be wicked  woe unto me   
and if i be righteous  yet shall i not 
lift up my head  
being filled with ignominy  
and looking upon mine affliction   
16and if it exalt itself  thou huntest 
me as a lion   
and again thou showest thyself 
marvellous upon me   17thou renewest thy witnesses 
against me   
and increasest thine indignation 
upon me   
host succeeding host against me   
 
18wherefore then hast thou broug ht 
me forth out of the womb   
would that i had perished  and no 
eye had seen me   
19i should have been as though i had 
not been   
i should have been carried from the 
womb to the grave   
20are not my days few  cease then   
and let me alone  that i may take 
comfort a little   
21before i go whence i shall not 
return   
even to the land of darkness and of 
the shadow of death   
22a land of thick darkness  as 
darkness itself   
a land of the shadow of death  
without any order   
and where the light is as darkness   
 
then  answered zophar the 
naamathite  and said   
2should not the multitude of words 
be answered   
and should a man full of talk be 
accounted right   
3thy boastings have made men hold 
their peace   
and thou hast mocked  with none to 
make thee ashamed   
4and thou hast said  my doctrine is 
pure  11 job 
1112  
 and i am clean in thine eyes   
5but oh that god would speak   
and open his lips against thee   
6and that he would tell thee the 
secrets of wisdom   
that sound wisdom is manifold   
know therefore that god exacteth  of 
thee less than thine iniquity 
deserveth   
 
7canst thou find out the deep things 
of god   
canst thou attain unto the purpose 
of the almighty   
8it is high as heaven  what canst 
thou do   
deeper than the nether world  what 
canst thou know   
9the measure thereof is longer than 
the earth   
and broader than the sea   
10if he pass by  and shut up   
or gather in  then who can hinder 
him  
11for he knoweth base men   
and when he seeth iniquity  will he 
not then consider it   
12but an empty man will get 
understa nding   
when a wild ass s colt is born a 
man  
 
13if thou set thy heart aright   
and stretch out thy hands toward 
him 
14if iniquity be in thy hand  put it far 
away   
and let not unrighteousness dwell in 
thy tents  15surely then shalt thou lift up thy 
face without spot   
yea thou shalt be stedfast  and shalt 
not fear   
16for thou shalt forget thy misery   
thou shalt remember it as waters 
that are passed away   
17and thy life shall be clearer than 
the noonday   
though there be darkness  it shall be 
as the m orning   
18and thou shalt be secure  because 
there is hope   
yea thou shalt look about thee  and 
shalt take thy rest in safety   
19also thou shalt lie down  and none 
shall make thee afraid   
yea many shall make suit unto 
thee  
20but the eyes of the wick ed shall 
fail  
and they shall have no way to flee   
and their hope shall be the drooping 
of the soul   
 
then job answered and said   
2no doubt but ye are the   
  people   
and wisdom shall die with you   
3but i have understanding as well as 
you  
i am n ot inferior to you   
yea who knoweth not such things 
as these   
4i am as one that is a laughing stock 
to his neighbour   
a man that called upon god   
and he answered him   12 job 
1113  
 the just  the innocent man is a 
laughing stock   
5a contemptible brand in the 
thoug ht of him that is at ease   
a thing ready for them whose foot 
slippeth   
6the tents of robbers prosper   
and they that provoke god are 
secure   
in whatsoever god bringeth into 
their hand   
 
7but ask now the beasts  and they 
shall teach thee   
and the fowls  of the air  and they 
shall tell thee   
8or speak to the earth  and it shall 
teach thee   
and the fishes of the sea shall 
declare unto thee   
9who knoweth not among all these   
that the hand of the lord hath 
wrought this   
10in whose hand is the soul of ev ery 
living thing   
and the breath of all mankind  
11doth not the ear try words   
even as the palate tasteth its food   
12is wisdom with aged men   
and understanding in length of 
days 
13with him is wisdom and might   
he hath counsel and understanding   
14behold  he breaketh down  and it 
cannot be built again   
he shutteth up a man  and there can 
be no opening   
15behold  he withholdeth the 
waters  and they dry up   also he sendeth them out  and they 
overturn the earth   
16with him is strength and sound 
wisdom   
the deceived and the deceiver are 
his  
17he leadeth counsellors away 
stripped   
and judges maketh he fools   
18he looseth the bond of kings   
and bindeth their loins with a 
girdle   
19he leadeth priests away stripped   
and overthroweth the mighty   
20he removeth the speech of men of 
trust  
and taketh away the sense of the 
elders   
21he poureth contempt upon princes   
and looseth the belt of the strong   
22he uncovereth deep things out of 
darkness   
and bringeth out to light the shadow 
of death   
23he increaseth the nations  and 
destroyeth them   
he enlargeth the nations  and 
leadeth them away   
24he taketh away the heart of the 
chiefs of the people of the land   
and causeth them to wander in a 
wilderness where there is no way   
25they grope in the d ark without 
light  
and he maketh them to stagger like 
a drunken man   
 
lo mine eye hath seen all this   
mine ear hath heard and   13 job 
1114  
   understood it   
2what ye know  do i know also   
i am not inferior unto you   
3notwithstanding i would speak to 
the almi ghty  
and i desire to reason with god   
4but ye are plasterers of lies   
ye are all physicians of no value   
5oh that ye would altogether hold 
your peace   
and it would be your wisdom   
6hear now my reasoning   
and hearken to the pleadings of my 
lips  
7will ye speak unrighteously for 
god  
and talk deceitfully for him   
8will ye show him favour   
will ye contend for god   
9would it be good that he should 
search you out   
or as one mocketh a man  will ye 
mock him   
10he will surely reprove you   
if ye do s ecretly show favour   
11shall not his majesty terrify you   
and his dread fall upon you   
12your memorials shall be like unto 
ashes   
your eminences to eminences of 
clay  
 
13hold your peace  let me alone  that 
i may speak   
and let come on me what will   
14wherefore  i will take my flesh in 
my teeth   
and put my life in my hand   15though he slay me  yet will i trust 
in him   
but i will argue my ways before 
him  
16this also shall be my salvation   
that a hypocrite cannot come before 
him  
17hear diligentl y my speech   
and let my declaration be in your 
ears  
18behold now  i have ordered my 
cause   
i know that i shall be justified   
19who is he that will contend with 
me  
for then would i hold my peace and 
die  
 
20only do not two things unto me   
then will  i not hide myself from 
thee   
21withdraw thy hand far from me   
and let not thy terror make me 
afraid   
22then call thou  and i will answer   
or let me speak  and answer thou 
me  
23how many are mine iniquities and 
sins  
make me to know my transgression 
and my sin   
24wherefore hidest thou thy face   
and holdest me for thine enemy   
25wilt thou harass a driven leaf   
and wilt thou pursue the dry 
stubble   
26that thou shouldest write bitter 
things against me   job 
1115  
 and make me to inherit the 
iniquities of my yo uth  
27thou puttest my feet also in the 
stocks   
and lookest narrowly unto all my 
paths   
thou drawest thee a line about the 
soles of my feet   
28though i am like a wine skin that 
consumeth   
like a garment that is moth eaten   
 
man that is born of a w oman  
is of few days  and full of   
  trouble   
2he cometh forth like a flower  and 
withereth   
he fleeth also as a shadow  and 
continueth not   
3and dost thou open thine eyes 
upon such a one   
and bringest me into judgment with 
thee   
4who can bring a cle an thing out of 
an unclean  not one   
5seeing his days are determined   
the number of his months is with 
thee   
and thou hast appointed his bounds 
that he cannot pass   
6look away from him  that he may 
rest  
till he shall accomplish  as a 
hireling  his da y  
 
7for there is hope of a tree   
if it be cut down  that it will sprout 
again   and that the tender branch thereof 
will not cease   
8though the root thereof wax old in 
the earth   
and the stock thereof die in the 
ground   
9yet through the scent of water  it 
will bud   
and put forth boughs like a plant   
10but man dieth  and lieth low   
yea man perisheth  and where is 
he  
11as the waters fail from the sea   
and the river is drained dry   
12so man lieth down and riseth not   
till the heavens be no more  they 
shall not awake   
nor be roused out of their sleep   
13oh that thou wouldest hide me in 
the nether world   
that thou wouldest keep me secret  
until thy wrath be past   
that thou wouldest appoint me a 
set time  and remember me  
14if a man die  may he l ive again   
all the days of my service would i 
wait till my relief should come  
15thou wouldest call  and i would 
answer thee   
thou wouldest have a desire to the 
work of thy hands   
16but now thou numberest my 
steps   
thou dost not even wait for my sin   
17my transgression is sealed up in a 
bag  
and thou heapest up mine iniquity   
18and surely the mountain falling 
crumbleth away   14 job 
1116  
 and the rock is removed out of its 
place   
19the waters wear the stones   
the overflowings thereof wash 
away the dust of the earth   
so thou destroyest the hope of man   
20thou prevailest for ever against 
him and he passeth   
thou changest his countenance  and 
sendest him away   
21his sons come to honour  and he 
knoweth it not   
and they are brought low  but he 
regardeth them n ot  
22but his flesh grieveth for him   
and his soul mourneth over him   
 
then answered eliphaz the 
temanite  and said   
2should a wise man make answer 
with windy knowledge   
and fill his belly with the east 
wind   
3should he reason with unprofitable 
talk  
or with speeches wherewith he can 
do no good   
4yea thou doest away with fear   
and impairest devotion before god   
5for thine iniquity teacheth thy 
mouth   
and thou choosest the tongue of the 
crafty   
6thine own mouth condemneth 
thee and not i   
yea thine own lips testify against 
thee  
 7art thou the first man that was 
born  
or wast thou brought forth before 
the hills   
8dost thou hearken in the council of 
god  
and dost thou restrain wisdom to 
thyself   
9what knowest thou  that we know 
not  
what understandest thou  which is 
not in us   
10with us are both the gray headed 
and the very aged men   
much older than thy father   
11are the consolations of god too 
small for thee   
and the word that dealeth gently 
with thee   
12why doth thy heart carry th ee 
away   
and why do thine eyes wink   
13that thou turnest thy spirit against 
god  
and lettest such words go out of thy 
mouth   
14what is man  that he should be 
clean   
and he that is born of a woman  that 
he should be righteous   
15behold  he putteth no trust in his 
holy ones   
yea the heavens are not clean in 
his sight   
16how much less one that is 
abominable and impure   
man who drinketh iniquity like 
water   
 15 job 
1117  
 17i will tell thee  hear thou me   
and that which i have seen i will 
declare  
18which wise me n have told  
from their fathers  and have not hid 
it  
19unto whom alone the land was 
given   
and no stranger passed among 
them   
20the wicked man travaileth with 
pain all his days   
even the number of years that are 
laid up for the oppressor   
21a sound o f terrors is in his ears   
in prosperity the destroyer shall 
come upon him   
22he believeth not that he shall 
return out of darkness   
and he is waited for of the sword   
23he wandereth abroad for bread  
where is it   
he knoweth that the day of darkness 
is ready at his hand   
24distress and anguish overwhelm 
him  
they prevail against him  as a king 
ready to the battle   
25because he hath stretched out his 
hand against god   
and behaveth himself proudly 
against the almighty   
26he runneth upon him with a stiff 
neck   
with the thick bosses of his 
bucklers   
27because he hath covered his face 
with his fatness   and made collops of fat on his 
loins   
28and he hath dwelt in desolate 
cities   
in houses which no man would 
inhabit   
which were ready to become hea ps  
29he shall not be rich  neither shall 
his substance continue   
neither shall their produce bend to 
the earth   
30he shall not depart out of 
darkness   
the flame shall dry up his branches   
and by the breath of his mouth 
shall he go away   
31let him no t trust in vanity  
deceiving himself   
for vanity shall be his recompense   
32it shall be accomplished before his 
time  
and his branch shall not be leafy   
33he shall shake off his unripe grape 
as the vine   
and shall cast off his flower as the 
olive   
34for the company of the godless 
shall be desolate   
and fire shall consume the tents of 
bribery   
35they conceive mischief  and bring 
forth iniquity   
and their belly prepareth deceit   
 
then job answered and said   
2i have heard many such   
   things   
sorry comforters are ye all   
3shall windy words have an end   16 job 
1118  
 or what provoketh thee that thou 
answerest   
4i also could speak as ye do   
if your soul were in my soul s stead   
i could join words together against 
you  
and shake my head at you   
5i would strengthen you with my 
mouth   
and the moving of my lips would 
assuage your grief   
 
6though i speak  my pain is not 
assuaged   
and though i forbear  what am i 
eased   
7but now he hath made me weary   
thou hast made desolate all my 
company   
8and thou hast  shrivelled me up  
which is a witness against me   
and my leanness riseth up against 
me it testifieth to my face   
9he hath torn me in his wrath  and 
hated me   
he hath gnashed upon me with his 
teeth   
mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes 
upon me   
10they h ave gaped upon me with 
their mouth   
they have smitten me upon the 
cheek scornfully   
they gather themselves together 
against me   
11god delivereth me to the ungodly   
and casteth me into the hands of the 
wicked   12i was at ease  and he broke me 
asunder   
yea he hath taken me by the neck  
and dashed me to pieces   
he hath also set me up for his mark   
13his archers compass me round 
about   
he cleaveth my reins asunder  and 
doth not spare   
he poureth out my gall upon the 
ground   
14he breaketh me with bre ach upon 
breach   
he runneth upon me like a giant   
15i have sewed sackcloth upon my 
skin  
and have laid my horn in the dust   
16my face is reddened with weeping   
and on my eyelids is the shadow of 
death   
17although there is no violence in 
my hands   
and my prayer is pure   
18o earth  cover not thou my blood   
and let my cry have no resting 
place   
19even now  behold  my witness is 
in heaven   
and he that testifieth of me is on 
high  
20mine inward thoughts are my 
intercessors   
mine eye poureth out tear s unto 
god  
21that he would set aright a man 
contending with god   
as a son of man setteth aright his 
neighbour   job 
1119  
 22for the years that are few are 
coming on   
and i shall go the way whence i

my spirit is consumed  my 
 days are extinc t  
the grave is ready for me   
2surely there are mockers with me   
and mine eye abideth in their 
provocation   
3give now a pledge  be surety for 
me with thyself   
who else is there that will strike 
hands with me   
4for thou hast hid their heart from 
under standing   
therefore shalt thou not exalt them   
5he that denounceth his friends for 
the sake of flattery   
even the eyes of his children shall 
fail  
 
6he hath made me also a byword of 
the people   
and i am become one in whose face 
they spit   
7mine eye a lso is dimmed by reason 
of vexation   
and all my members are as a 
shadow   
8upright men are astonished at this   
and the innocent stirreth up himself 
against the godless   
9yet the righteous holdeth on his 
way  
and he that hath clean hands waxeth 
stronger  and stronger   
10but as for you all  do ye return  
and come now   and i shall not find a wise man 
among you   
11my days are past  my purposes are 
broken off   
even the thoughts of my heart   
12they change the night into day   
the light is short because of  
darkness   
13if i look for the nether world as 
my house   
if i have spread my couch in the 
darkness   
14if i have said to corruption  thou 
art my father   
to the worm  thou art my mother  
and my sister   
15where then is my hope   
and as for my hope  who shall see 
it  
16they shall go down to the bars of 
the nether world   
when we are at rest together in the

then answered bildad the

3wherefor e are we counted as 
beasts

and his lamp over him shall be put 
out  
7the steps of his strength shall be 
straitened

10a noose is hid for him in the

and shall entrap him at his feet   
12his t rouble shall be ravenous   
and calamity shall be ready for his

yea the first born of death shall 
devour his members

plucked out of his tent   
and he shall be brought to the king 
of terrors   
15there shall dwell in his tent that 
which is none of his   
brimstone shall be scattered upon 
his habitation

and above shall his branch wither   17his remembrance shall perish 
from the earth   
and he shall have no name abroad

darkness

19he shall have neither son nor son s 
son among his people   
nor any remaining in his dwellings   
20they that come after shall be 
astonished at his day   
as they that went before are 
affrighted   
21surely such are the dwellings of 
the wicked

mine error remaineth with myself

yourselves against me

my cause

10he hath broken me down on every 
side and i am gone   
and my hope hath he plucked up 
like a tree   
11he hath also kindled his wrath 
against me   
and he counteth me unto him as 
one of his adversarie s  
12his troops come on together   
and cast up their way against me   
and encamp round about my tent   
13he hath put my brethren far from 
me  
and mine acquaintance are wholly 
estranged from me   
14my kinsfolk have failed   
and my familiar friends have 
forgotten me   
15they that dwell in my house  and 
my maids  count me for a 
stranger   
i am become an alien in their sight  
16i call unto my servant  and he 
giveth me no answer   
though i entreat him with my 
mouth   
17my breath is abhorred of my wife   
and i am loathsome to the children 
of my tribe   
18even urchins despised me   
if i arise  they speak against me   
19all my intimate friends abhor me   
and they whom i loved are turned 
against me   20my bone cleaveth to my skin and 
to my flesh   
and i am escaped with the skin of 
my teeth   
 
21have pity upon me  have pity upon 
me o ye my friends   
for the hand of god hath touched 
me  
22why do ye persecute me as god   
and are not satisfied with my flesh

written   
oh that they were ins cribed in a 
book   
24that with an iron pen and lead  
they were graven in the rock for 
ever  
25but as for me  i know that my 
redeemer liveth   
and that he will witness at the last 
upon the dust   
26and when after my skin this is 
destroyed   
then without my  flesh shall i see 
god  
27whom i  even i  shall see for 
myself   
and mine eyes shall behold  and not 
another s  
my reins are consumed within me   
28if ye say  how we will persecute 
him   
seeing that the root of the matter is 
found in me

 that ye may know there is a

then answered zophar the

2therefore do my thoughts give 
answer to me   
even by reason of mine agitation 
that is in me   
3i have heard the reproof which

but out of my understanding my 
spirit answereth me   
 
4knowest thou not this of old time   
since man was placed upon earth   
5that the triumphing of the wicked 
is short   
and the joy of the godless but fo r a 
moment   
6though his excellency mount up to 
the heavens   
and his head reach unto the clouds

they that have seen him shall say  
where is he

his mouth   
though he hide it under his tongue

it go  
but keep it still within his mouth

turned  
it is the gall of asps within him   
15he hath swallowed down riches  
and he shall vomit them up again   
god shall cast them out of his belly   
16he shall suck the poison of asps   
the viper s tongue shall slay him   
17he shall not look upon the rivers   
the flowing streams of honey and 
curd  
18that which he laboured for shall 
he give back  and shall not 
swallow it down   
according to the substance that he 
hath gotten  he shall not rejoice   
19for he hath oppressed and 
forsaken the poor   
he hath viole ntly taken away a 
house  and he shall not build it 
up  
20because he knew no quietness 
within him   
in his greed he suffered nought to 
escape   
21there was nothing left that he 
devoured not  
therefore his prosperity shall not 
endure   20 job

 22in the fulness of h is sufficiency he

the hand of every one that is in

belly   
he shall cast the fierceness of his 
wrath upon him   
and shall cause it to rain upon him 
into his flesh   
24if he flee from the iron weapon   
the bow of brass shall strike him

25he draweth it forth  and it cometh 
out of his body   
yea the glittering point cometh out 
of his gall   
terrors are upon him   
26all darkness is laid up for his

a fire not blown by man shall

it shall go ill with him that is left in 
his tent   
27the heavens shall reveal his 
iniquity   
and the earth shall rise up against 
him  
28the increase of his house shall

his goods shall flow away in the

the counsel of the wicked is far

that their calamity cometh upon

that he distributeth pains in his

 then answered eliphaz the

2can a man be profitable  unto god   
or can he that is wise be profitable 
unto him   
3is it any advantage to the almighty  
that thou art righteous   
or is it gain to him  that thou 
makest thy ways blameless   
4is it for thy fear of him that he 
reproveth thee   
that he entereth wit h thee into 
judgment   
5is not thy wickedness great   
and are not thine iniquities without 
end  
6for thou hast taken pledges of thy 
brother for nought   
and stripped the naked of their 
clothing   
7thou hast not given water to the 
weary to drink   
and thou  hast withholden bread 
from the hungry   
8and as a mighty man  who hath the 
earth   
and as a man of rank  who dwelleth 
in it  
9thou hast sent widows away 
empty   
and the arms of the fatherless have 
been broken   
10therefore snares are round about 
thee  
and sudden dread affrighted thee   
11or darkness  that thou canst not 
see  
and abundance of waters cover 
thee  12is not god in the height of heaven

how high they are   
13and thou sayest  what doth god 
know   
can he judge through the dark 
cloud   
14thick clouds are a covering to 
him that he seeth not   
and he walketh in the circuit of 
heaven   
15wilt thou keep the old way  
which wicked men have trodden   
16who were snatched away before 
their time   
whose foundation was poured out 
as a stream   
17who said unto god  depart from 
us  
and what could the almighty do 
unto them   
18yet he filled their houses with 
good things  
but the counsel of the wicked is far 
from me   
19the righteous saw it  and were 
glad  
and the in nocent laugh them to

20surely their substance is cut off   
and their abundance the fire hath

 and lay up his words in thy heart   
23if thou return to the almighty  
thou shalt be built up  
if thou put away unrighteousness far

24and lay thy treasure in the dust   
and the gold of ophir among the 
stones of the brooks   
25and the almi ghty be thy treasure

2even to day is my complaint 
  bitter   
my hand is become heavy because

3oh that i knew where i might find 
him  
that i might come even to his seat   
4i would order my cause before 
him  
and fill my mouth with arguments   5i would know the words which he 
would answer me   
and understand what he would say 
unto me   
6would he contend with me in his 
great power   
nay but he would give heed unto 
me  
7there the upright might reason 
with him   
so should i be delivered for ever 
from my judge   
 
8behold  i go forward  but he is not 
there   
and backward  but i cannot 
perceive him   
9on the left hand  when he doth 
work  but i cannot behold him   
he turneth himself  to the right 
hand  but i cannot see him   
 
10for he knoweth the way that i 
take  
when he hath tried me  i shall come 
forth as gold   
11my foot hath held fast to his steps   
his way have i kept  and turned not 
aside   
12i have not gone back from the 
comma ndment of his lips   
i have treasured up the words of his 
mouth more than my necessary 
food  
 
13but he is at one with himself  and 
who can turn him   
and what his soul desireth  even 
that he doeth   23 job 
1127  
 14for he will perform that which is 
appointed for me   
and many such things are with 
him  
15therefore am i affrighted at his 
presence   
when i consider  i am afraid of 
him  
16yea god hath made my heart 
faint  
and the almighty hath affrighted 
me  
17because i was not cut off before 
the darkness   
neither did  he cover the thick 
darkness from my face   
 
why are times not laid up by

and why do not they that know him

they violently take away flocks

the mountains   
and embrace the rock for want of a

from the breast   
and take a pledge of the poor

without clothing   
and being hungry they carry the 
sheaves   
11they make oil within the rows  of 
these men   
they tread their winepresses  and 
suffer thirst

groan   
and the soul of the wounded crieth 
out  
yet god imputeth it not for 
unseemliness

against the light   
they know not the ways thereof  
nor abide in the paths thereof

 16in the dark they dig through

they shut themselves up in the day

they know not the light

for they know the terrors of the

so doth the nether world those that

20the womb forgetteth him  the

he shall be no more remembered   
and unrighteousness is broken as a 
tree  
21he devoureth the barren that 
beareth not   
and doeth not good to the widow   
22he draweth away the mighty also 
by his power   
he riseth up  and he truste th not his

unto the confines of light and

11the pillars of heaven tremble

12he stirreth up the sea with his

his hand hath pierced the slant

and how small a whisper is heard of 
him  
but the thunder of his mighty deeds 
who can understand    
and job again took up his 
parable  and said   
2as god liveth  who hath taken 
away my right   
and the almighty  who hath dealt 
bitterly with me   
3all the while my breath is in me  
and the spirit of god is in my 
nostrils   
4surely my lips shall not speak 
unrighteousness   
neither shall my tongue utter deceit   
5far be it from me that i should 
justify you   
till i die i will not put away mine 
integrity from me   
6my righteousness i hold fast  and 
will not let it go   
my heart shall not reproach me so 
long as i live   
 
7let mine enemy be as the wicked   
and let him that riseth up against 
me be as the unrighteous   
8for what is the hope of the godless  
though he get him gain   
when god taketh away his soul   
9will god hear his cry   
when trouble cometh upon him   
10will he hav e his delight in the 
almighty   
and call upon god at all times   
11i will teach you concerning the 
hand of god   
that which is with the almighty 
will i not conceal   
12behold  all ye yourselves have 
seen it   27 job 
1130  
 why then are ye become altogether 
vain  
13this is the portion of a wicked 
man with god   
and the heritage of oppressors  
which they receive from the 
almighty   
14if his children be multiplied  it is 
for the sword   
and his offspring shall not have 
bread enough   
15those that remain of him shall be 
buried by pestilence   
and his widows shall make no 
lamentation   
16though he heap up silver as the 
dust  
and prepare raiment as the clay   
17he may prepare it  but the just 
shall put it on   
and the innocent shall divide the 
silver   
18he buildeth his house  as a moth   
and as a booth which the keeper 
maketh   
19he lieth down rich  but there shall 
be no ught to gather   
he openeth his eyes  and his wealth 
is not   
20terrors overtake him like waters   
a tempest stealeth him away in the 
night   
21the east wind c arrieth him away  
and he departeth   
and it sweepeth him out of his 
place   
22yea it hurleth at him  and spareth 
not  
he would fain flee from its power   23men shall clap their hands at him   
and shall hiss him out of his place   
 
for there is a mine for silver  
and a place for gold which  
  they refine   
2iron is taken out of the dust   
and brass is molten out of the stone   
3man setteth an end to darkness   
and searcheth out to the furthest 
bound  
the stones of thick darkness and of 
the shadow of dea th  
4he breaketh open a shaft away 
from where men sojourn   
they are forgotten of the foot that 
passeth by   
they hang afar from men  they 
swing to and fro   
5as for the earth  out of it cometh 
bread   
and underneath it is turned up as it 
were by fire   
6the stones thereof are the place of 
sapphires   
and it hath dust of gold   
7that path no bird of prey knoweth   
neither hath the falcon s eye seen it   
8the proud beasts have not trodden 
it  
nor hath the lion passed thereby   
9he putteth forth his hand up on the 
flinty rock   
he overturneth the mountains by the 
roots   
10he cutteth out channels among the 
rocks   
and his eye seeth every precious 
thing   28 job 
1131  
 11he bindeth the streams that they 
trickle not   
and the thing that is hid bringeth he 
forth to light   
 
12but wisdom  where shall it be 
found   
and where is the place of 
understanding   
13man knoweth not the price 
thereof   
neither is it found in the land of the 
living   
14the deep saith  it is not in me   
and the sea saith  it is not with 
me  
15it canno t be gotten for gold   
neither shall silver be weighed for 
the price thereof   
16it cannot be valued with the gold 
of ophir   
with the precious onyx  or the 
sapphire   
17gold and glass cannot equal it   
neither shall the exchange thereof 
be vessels of fine  gold  
18no mention shall be made of coral 
or of crystal   
yea the price of wisdom is above 
rubies   
19the topaz of ethiopia shall not 
equal it   
neither shall it be valued with pure 
gold  
 
20whence then cometh wisdom   
and where is the place of 
underst anding   21seeing it is hid from the eyes of all 
living   
and kept close from the fowls of the 
air  
22destruction and death say   
we have heard a rumor thereof 
with our ears   
23god understandeth the way 
thereof   
and he knoweth the place thereof   
24for he looketh to the ends of the 
earth   
and seeth under the whole heaven   
25when he maketh a weight for the 
wind   
and meteth out the waters by 
measure   
26when he made a decree for the 
rain  
and a way for the storm of 
thunders   
27then did he see it  and declare it   
he established it  yea and searched 
it out   
 
28and unto man he said   
behold  the fear of the lord  that is 
wisdom   
and to depart from evil is 
understanding   
 
and job again took up his 
parable  and said   
2oh that i were as in the m onths of 
old  
as in the days when god watched 
over me   
3when his lamp shined above my 
head   29 job 
1132  
 and by his light i walked through 
darkness   
4as i was in the days of my youth   
when the converse of god was 
upon my tent   
5when the almighty was yet with 
me  
and my children were about me   
6when my steps were washed with 
butter   
and the rock poured me out rivers 
of oil   
7when i went forth to the gate unto 
the city   
when i prepared my seat in the 
broad place   
8the young men saw me and hid 
themselves   
and the aged rose up and stood   
9the princes refrained talking   
and laid their hand on their mouth   
10the voice of the nobles was 
hushed   
and their tongue cleaved to the roof 
of their mouth   
11for when the ear heard me  then it 
blessed me   
and when the e ye saw me  it gave 
witness unto me   
12because i delivered the poor that 
cried   
the fatherless also  that had none to 
help him   
13the blessing of him that was ready 
to perish came upon me  and i 
caused the widow s heart to sing 
for joy   
14i put on right eousness  and it 
clothed itself with me   my justice was as a robe and a 
diadem   
15i was eyes to the blind   
and feet was i to the lame   
16i was a father to the needy   
and the cause of him that i knew 
not i searched out   
17and i broke the jaws of the 
unrighteous   
and plucked the prey out of his 
teeth   
18then i said  i shall die with my 
nest  
and i shall multiply my days as the 
phoenix   
19my root shall be spread out to the 
waters   
and the dew shall lie all night upon 
my branch   
20my glory shall be  fresh in me   
and my bow shall be renewed in 
my hand   
 
21unto me men gave ear  and 
waited   
and kept silence for my counsel   
22after my words they spoke not 
again   
and my speech dropped upon them   
23and they waited for me as for the 
rain  
and they o pened their mouth wide 
as for the latter rain   
24if i laughed on them  they believed 
it not   
and the light of my countenance 
they cast not down   
25i chose out their way  and sat as 
chief   job 
1133  
 and dwelt as a king in the army   
as one that comforteth the 
mourners   
 
but now they that are younger 
 than i have me in derision   
whose fathers i disdained to set 
with the dogs of my flock   
2yea the strength of their hands  
whereto should it profit me   
men in whom ripe age is perished   
3they are gaunt with wa nt and 
famine   
they gnaw the dry ground  in the 
gloom of wasteness and 
desolation   
4they pluck salt wort with 
wormwood   
and the roots of the broom are their 
food  
5they are driven forth from the 
midst of men   
they cry after them as after a thief   
6in the clefts of the valleys must 
they dwell   
in holes of the earth and of the 
rocks   
7among the bushes they bray   
under the nettles they are gathered 
together   
8they are children of churls  yea 
children of ignoble men   
they were scourged out of the la nd  
 
9and now i am become their song   
yea i am a byword unto them   
10they abhor me  they flee far from 
me  
and spare not to spit in my face   11for he hath loosed my cord  and 
afflicted me   
and they have cast off the bridle 
before me   
12upon my righ t hand rise the 
brood   
they entangle my feet   
and they cast up against me their 
ways of destruction   
13they break up my path   
they further my calamity   
even men that have no helper   
14as through a wide breach they 
come   
in the midst of the ruin they  roll 
themselves upon me   
15terrors are turned upon me   
they chase mine honour as the 
wind   
and my welfare is passed away as a 
cloud   
 
16and now my soul is poured out 
within me   
days of affliction have taken hold 
upon me   
17in the night my bones are pierced  
and fall from me   
and my sinews take no rest   
18by the great force of my disease  
is my garment disfigured   
it bindeth me about as the collar of 
my coat   
19he hath cast me into the mire   
and i am become like dust and 
ashes   
20i cry unto the e and thou dost not 
answer me   
i stand up  and thou lookest at me   30 job 
1134  
 21thou art turned to be cruel to me   
with the might of thy hand thou 
hatest me   
22thou liftest me up to the wind  
thou causest me to ride upon it   
and thou dissolvest my substance   
23for i know that thou wilt bring 
me to death   
and to the house appointed for all 
living   
 
24surely none shall put forth his 
hand to a ruinous heap   
neither because of these things shall 
help come in one s calamity   
25if i have not wept for him that was  
in trouble   
and if my soul grieved not for the 
needy   
26yet when i looked for good  there 
came evil   
and when i waited for light  there 
came darkness   
27mine inwards boil  and rest not   
days of affliction are come upon 
me  
28i go mourning without t he sun   
i stand up in the assembly  and cry 
for help   
29i am become a brother to jackals   
and a companion to ostriches   
30my skin is black  and falleth from 
me  
and my bones are burned with heat   
31therefore is my harp turned to 
mourning   
and my pip e into the voice of them 
that weep   
 i made a covenant with mine 
 eyes  
how then should i look upon a 
maid   
2for what would be the portion of 
god from above   
and the heritage of the almighty 
from on high   
3is it not calamity to the 
unrighteous   
and disaster to the workers of 
iniquity   
4doth not he see my ways   
and count all my steps   
 
5if i have walked with vanity   
and my foot hath hasted to deceit   
6let me be weighed in a just 
balance   
that god may know mine 
integrity   
7if my step hath turn ed out of the 
way  
and my heart walked after mine 
eyes  
and if any spot hath cleaved to my 
hands   
8then let me sow  and let another 
eat  
yea let the produce of my field be 
rooted out   
 
9if my heart have been enticed unto 
a woman   
and i have lain in wait at my 
neighbour s door   
10then let my wife grind unto 
another   
and let others bow down upon her   31 job 
1135  
 11for that were a heinous crime   
yea it were an iniquity to be 
punished by the judges   
12for it is a fire that consumeth unto 
destruction   
and woul d root out all mine 
increase   
 
13if i did despise the cause of my 
manservant   
or of my maid servant  when they 
contended with me  
14what then shall i do when god 
riseth up   
and when he remembereth  what 
shall i answer him   
15did not he that made me in  the 
womb make him   
and did not one fashion us in the 
womb   
 
16if i have withheld aught that the 
poor desired   
or have caused the eyes of the 
widow to fail   
17or have eaten my morsel myself 
alone   
and the fatherless hath not eaten 
thereof  
18nay from  my youth he grew up 
with me as with a father   
and i have been her guide from my 
mother s womb   
19if i have seen any wanderer in 
want of clothing   
or that the needy had no covering   
20if his loins have not blessed me   
and if he were not warmed with th e 
fleece of my sheep   21if i have lifted up my hand against 
the fatherless   
because i saw my help in the gate   
22then let my shoulder fall from the 
shoulder blade   
and mine arm be broken from the 
bone   
23for calamity from god was a 
terror to me   
and by reason of his majesty i 
could do nothing   
24if i have made gold my hope   
and have said to the fine gold  
thou art my confidence   
25if i rejoiced because my wealth 
was great   
and because my hand had gotten 
much   
26if i beheld the sun when it shine d  
or the moon walking in brightness   
27and my heart hath been secretly 
enticed   
and my mouth hath kissed my 
hand   
28this also were an iniquity to be 
punished by the judges   
for i should have lied to god that is 
above   
 
29if i rejoiced at the destruc tion of 
him that hated me   
or exulted when evil found him   
30yea i suffered not my mouth to 
sin  
by asking his life with a curse   
31if the men of my tent said not   
who can find one that hath not 
been satisfied with his meat   job 
1136  
 32the stranger did not lodge in the 
street   
my doors i opened to the roadside   
 
33if after the manner of men i 
covered my transgressions   
by hiding mine iniquity in my 
bosom   
34because i feared the great 
multitude   
and the most contemptible among 
families terrified me   
so that i kept silence  and went not 
out of the door   
 
35oh that i had one to hear me  
lo here is my signature  let the 
almighty answer me  
and that i had the indictment which 
mine adversary hath written   
36surely i would carry it upon my 
shoulder   
i would bind it unto me as a crown   
37i would declare unto him the 
number of my steps   
as a prince would i go near unto 
him  
 
38if my land cry out against me   
and the furrows thereof weep 
together   
39if i have eaten the fruits thereof 
without money   
or have caused the tillers thereof to 
be disappointed   
40let thistles grow instead of wheat   
and noisome weeds instead of 
barley   
 the words of job are ended   
 
so these three men ceased to 
answer job  because he was 
righteous in his own eyes  2then was 
kindled the wrath of elihu the son of 
barachel the buzite  of the family of 
ram against job was his wrath 
kindled  because he justified himself 
rather than god  3also against his 
three friends was his wrath kindled  
because they had found no answer  and 
yet had condemned job  4now elihu 
had waited to speak unto job  because 
they were older than he  5and when 
elihu saw that there was no answer in 
the mouth of these three men  his 
wrath was kindled   
6and elihu the son of barachel the 
buzite answered and said   
i am young  and ye are very old   
wherefore i held back  and durst not 
declare you mine opinion   
7i said  days should speak   
and multitude of years should teach 
wisdom   
8but it is a spirit in man   
and the breath of the almighty  that 
giveth them u nderstanding   
9it is not the great that are wise   
nor the aged that discern judgment   
10therefore i say  hearken to me   
i also will declare mine opinion   
 
11behold  i waited for your words   
i listened for your reasons   
whilst ye searched out what to say   
12yea i attended unto you   32 job 
1137  
 and behold  there was none that 
convinced job   
or that answered his words  among 
you  
13beware lest ye say  we have 
found wisdom   
god may vanquish him  not man    
14for he hath not directed his words 
against me   
neither will i answer him with your 
speeches   
 
15they are amazed  they answer no 
more   
words are departed from them   
16and shall i wait  because they 
speak not   
because they stand still  and answer 
no more   
17i also will answer my part   
i also will declare mine opinion   
18for i am full of words   
the spirit within me constraineth 
me  
19behold  mine inwards are as wine 
which hath no vent   
like new wine skins which are 
ready to burst   
20i will speak  that i may find relief   
i will open my lips and  answer   
21let me not  i pray you  respect any 
mans person   
neither will i give flattering titles 
unto any man   
22for i know not to give flattering 
titles   
else would my maker soon take me 
away  
 howbeit  job i pray thee  hear 
 my speech   
and hear ken to all my words   
2behold now  i have opened my 
mouth   
my tongue hath spoken in my 
mouth   
3my words shall utter the 
uprightness of my heart   
and that which my lips know they 
shall speak sincerely   
4the spirit of god hath made me   
and the breath of  the almighty 
given me life   
5if thou canst  answer thou me   
set thy words in order before me  
stand forth   
6behold  i am toward god even as 
thou art   
i also am formed out of the clay   
7behold  my terror shall not make 
thee afraid   
neither shall my p ressure be heavy 
upon thee   
 
8surely thou hast spoken in my 
hearing   
and i have heard the voice of thy 
words   
9i am clean  without transgression   
i am innocent  neither is there 
iniquity in me   
10behold  he findeth occasions 
against me   
he counteth me for his enemy   
11he putteth my feet in the stocks   
he marketh all my paths   
 33 job 
1138  
 12behold  i answer thee  in this thou 
art not right   
that god is too great for man   
13why hast thou striven against 
him  
seeing that he will not answer any 
of his words   
14for god speaketh in one way   
yea in two  though man perceiveth 
it not   
15in a dream  in a vision of the night   
when deep sleep falleth upon men   
in slumberings upon the bed   
16then he openeth the ears of men   
and by their chastisement sealeth 
the decree   
17that men may put away their 
purpose   
and that he may hide pride from 
man  
18that he may keep back his soul 
from the pit   
and his life from perishing by the 
sword   
19he is chastened also with pain 
upon his bed   
and all his bones grow stiff   
20so that his life maketh him to 
abhor bread   
and his soul dainty food   
21his flesh is consumed away  that it 
cannot be seen   
and his bones corrode to 
unsightliness   
22yea his soul draweth near unto 
the pit   
and his life to the destroyers   
23if there be for him an angel   an intercessor  one among a 
thousand   
to vouch for a man s uprightness   
24then he is gracious unto him  and 
saith   
deliver him from going down to 
the pit   
i have found a ransom   
25his flesh is tenderer than a child s  
he returneth to the days of his 
youth   
26he prayeth unto god  and he is 
favourable unto him   
so that he seeth his face with joy   
and he restoreth unto man his 
righteousness   
27he cometh before men  and saith   
i have sinned  and perverted that 
which was r ight  
and it profited me not   
28so he redeemeth his soul from 
going into the pit   
and his life beholdeth the light   
 
29lo all these things doth god 
work   
twice  yea thrice  with a man   
30to bring back his soul from the 
pit  
that he may be enlighte ned with the 
light of the living   
 
31mark well  o job  hearken unto 
me  
hold thy peace  and i will speak   
32if thou hast any thing to say  
answer me   
speak  for i desire to justify thee   
33if not  hearken thou unto me   job 
1139  
 hold thy peace  and i will teac h thee 
wisdom   
 
moreover elihu answered and 
said  
2hear my words  ye wise men   
and give ear unto me  ye that have 
knowledge   
3for the ear trieth words   
as the palate tasteth food   
4let us choose for us that which is 
right   
let us know among ourse lves what 
is good   
5for job hath said  i am righteous   
and god hath taken away my right   
6notwithstanding my right i am 
accounted a liar   
my wound is incurable  though i am 
without transgression   
7what man is like job   
who drinketh up scorning like  
water   
8who goeth in company with the 
workers of iniquity   
and walketh with wicked men   
9for he hath said  it profiteth a man 
nothing  
that he should be in accord with 
god  
 
10therefore hearken unto me  ye 
men of understanding   
far be it from god  that he should 
do wickedness   
and from the almighty  that he 
should commit iniquity   
11for the work of a man will he 
requite unto him   and cause every man to find 
according to his ways   
12yea of a surety  god will not do 
wickedly   
neither will the al mighty pervert 
justice   
13who gave him a charge over the 
earth   
or who hath disposed the whole 
world   
14if he set his heart upon man   
if he gather unto himself his spirit 
and his breath   
15all flesh shall perish together   
and man shall return unto du st  
 
16if now thou hast understanding  
hear this   
hearken to the voice of my words   
17shall even one that hateth right 
govern   
and wilt thou condemn him that is 
just and mighty  
18is it fit to say to a king  thou art 
base  
or to nobles  ye are wick ed 
19that respecteth not the persons of 
princes   
nor regardeth the rich more than the 
poor  
for they all are the work of his 
hands   
20in a moment they die  even at 
midnight   
the people are shaken and pass 
away   
and the mighty are taken away 
without  hand   
 34 job 
1140  
 21for his eyes are upon the ways of 
a man   
and he seeth all his goings   
22there is no darkness  nor shadow 
of death   
where the workers of iniquity may 
hide themselves   
23for he doth not appoint a time 
unto any man   
when he should go before go d in 
judgment   
24he breaketh in pieces mighty men 
without inquisition   
and setteth others in their stead   
25therefore he taketh knowledge of 
their works   
and he overturneth them in the 
night  so that they are crushed   
26he striketh them as wicked men  
in the open sight of others   
27because they turned aside from 
following him   
and would not have regard to any 
of his ways   
28so that they cause the cry of the 
poor to come unto him   
and he heareth the cry of the 
afflicted   
29when he giveth quietness  who 
then can condemn   
and when he hideth his face  who 
then can behold him   
whether it be done unto a nation  or 
unto a man  alike   
30that the godless man reign not   
that there be none to ensnare the 
people   
 
31for hath any said unto god   i have bo rne chastisement  though i 
offend not   
32that which i see not teach thou 
me  
if i have done iniquity  i will do it 
no more   
33shall his recompense be as thou 
wilt for thou loathest it   
so that thou must choose  and not i   
therefore speak what thou k nowest   
34men of understanding will say 
unto me   
yea every wise man that heareth 
me  
35job speaketh without knowledge   
and his words are without 
discernment   
36would that job were tried unto the 
end  
because of his answering like 
wicked men   
37for he addeth rebellion unto his 
sin  
he clappeth his hands among us   
and multiplieth his words against 
god  
 
more over elihu answered and 
said  
2thinkest thou this to be thy right   
or sayest thou  i am righteousness 
before god   
3that thou inquires t what 
advantage will it be unto thee   
and what profit shall i have  more 
than if i had sinned   
4i will give thee answer   
and thy companions with thee   
5look unto the heavens  and see   35 job 
1141  
 and behold the skies  which are 
higher than thou   
6if thou hast sinned  what doest thou 
against him   
and if thy transgressions be 
multiplied  what doest thou unto 
him  
7if thou be righteous  what givest 
thou him   
or what receiveth he of thy hand   
8thy wickedness concerneth a man 
as thou art   
and thy righteous ness a son of man   
 
9by reason of the multitude of 
oppressions they cry out   
they cry for help by reason of the 
arm of the mighty   
10but none saith  where is god my 
maker   
who giveth songs in the night   
11who teacheth us more than the 
beasts of the e arth  
and maketh us wiser than the fowls 
of heaven   
12there they cry  but none giveth 
answer   
because of the pride of evil men   
13surely god will not hear vanity   
neither will the almighty regard it   
14yea when thou sayest thou canst 
not see him  
the cause is before him  therefore 
wait thou for him   
15and now  is it for nought that he 
punished in his anger   
and hath he not full knowledge of 
arrogance   16but job doth open his mouth in 
vanity   
he multiplieth words without 
knowledge   
 
elihu als o proceeded  and 
said  
2suffer me a little  and i will tell 
thee  
for there are yet words on god s 
behalf   
3i will fetch my knowledge from 
afar  
and will ascribe righteousness to 
my maker   
4for truly my words are not false   
one that is upright in min d is with 
thee  
5behold  god is mighty  yet he 
despiseth not any   
he is mighty in strength of 
understanding   
6he preserveth not the life of the 
wicked   
but giveth to the poor their right   
7he withdraweth not his eyes from 
the righteous   
but with king s upon the throne  
he setteth them for ever  and they 
are exalted   
8and if they be bound in fetters   
and be holden in cords of affliction   
9then he declareth unto them their 
work   
and their transgressions  that they 
have behaved themselves 
proudly   
10he openeth also their ear to 
discipline   36 job 
1142  
 and commandeth that they return 
from iniquity   
11if they hearken and serve him   
they shall spend their days in 
prosperity   
and their years in pleasures   
12but if they hearken not  they shall 
perish by the sword   
and they shall die without 
knowledge   
13but they that are godless in heart 
lay up anger   
they cry not for help when he 
bindeth them   
14their soul perisheth in youth   
and their life as that of the 
depraved   
15he delivereth the afflicted by his 
affliction   
and openeth their ear by tribulation   
16yea he hath allured thee out of 
distress  
into a broad place  where there is no 
straitness   
and that which is set on thy table is 
full of fatness   
17and thou art full of the judgment 
of the wicked   
judgm ent and justice take hold on 
them   
18for beware of wrath  lest thou be 
led away by thy sufficiency   
neither let the greatness of the 
ransom turn thee aside   
19will thy riches avail  that are 
without stint   
or all the forces of thy strength   
20desire n ot the night   when peoples are cut off in their 
place   
21take heed  regard not iniquity   
for this hast thou chosen rather than 
affliction   
 
22behold  god doeth loftily in his 
power   
who is a teacher like him   
23who hath enjoined him his way   
or who hath said  thou hast 
wrought unrighteousness   
24remember that thou magnify his 
work   
whereof men have sung   
25all men have looked thereon   
man beholdeth it afar off   
26behold  god is great  beyond our 
knowledge   
the number of his years is 
unsearcha ble  
27for he draweth away the drops of 
water   
which distil rain from his vapour   
28which the skies pour down  
and drop upon the multitudes of 
men  
29yea can any understand the 
spreadings of the clouds   
the crashings of his pavilion   
30behold  he sp readeth his light 
upon it   
and he covereth the depths of the 
sea  
31for by these he judgeth the 
peoples   
he giveth food in abundance   
32he covereth his hands with the 
lightning   job 
1143  
 and giveth it a charge that it strike 
the mark   
33the noise thereof tell eth 
concerning it   
the cattle also concerning the storm 
that cometh up   
 
at this also my heart 
 trembleth   
and is moved out of its place   
2hear attentively the noise of his 
voice   
and the sound that goeth out of his 
mouth   
3he sendeth it forth und er the whole 
heaven   
and his lightning unto the ends of 
the earth   
4after it a voice roareth   
he thundereth with the voice of his 
majesty   
and he stayeth them not when his 
voice is heard   
5god thundereth marvellously with 
his voice   
great things doet h he  which we 
cannot comprehend   
6for he saith to the snow  fall thou 
on the earth   
likewise to the shower of rain  and 
to the showers of his mighty rain   
7he sealeth up the hand of every 
man  
that all men whom he hath made 
may know it   
8then the b easts go into coverts   
and remain in their dens   
9out of the chamber cometh the 
storm   and cold out of the north   
10by the breath of god ice is given   
and the breadth of the waters is 
straitened   
11yea he ladeth the thick cloud 
with moister   
he spr eadeth abroad the cloud of 
his lightning   
12and they are turned round about 
by his guidance   
that they may do whatsoever he 
commandeth them  
upon the face of the habitable 
world   
13whether it be for correction  or for 
his earth   
or for mercy  that he c ause it to 
come   
 
14hearken unto this  o job   
stand still  and consider the 
wondrous works of god   
15dost thou know how god 
enjoineth them   
and causeth the lightning of his 
cloud to shine   
16dost thou know the balancings of 
the clouds   
the wondrous w orks of him who is 
perfect in knowledge   
17thou whose garments are warm   
when the earth is still by reason of 
the south wind   
18canst thou with him spread out 
the sky   
which is strong as a molten mirror   
19teach us what we shall say unto 
him  37 job 
1144  
 for we cannot order our speech by 
reason of darkness   
20shall it be told him that i would 
speak   
or should a man wish that he were 
swallowed up   
 
21and now men see not the light 
which is bright in the skies   
but the wind passeth  and cleanseth 
them   
22out of  the north cometh golden 
splendour   
about god is terrible majesty   
23the almighty  whom we cannot 
find out  is excellent in power   
yet to judgment and plenteous 
justice he doeth no violence   
24men do therefore fear him   
he regardeth not any that are w ise 
of heart   
 
then the lord answered job 
out of the whirlwind  and said   
2who is this that darkeneth counsel  
by words without knowledge   
3gird up now thy loins like a man

thereof fastened   or who laid the corner stone 
thereof   
7when the morning stars sang 
together   
and all the sons of god shouted for 
joy  
 
8or who shut up the sea with doors   
when it broke forth  and issued out 
of the womb   
9when i made the cloud the garment 
thereof   
and thick darkness a swaddlingban d 
for it   
10and prescribed for it my decree   
and set bars and doors   
11and said  thus far shalt thou 
come  but no further   
and here shall thy proud waves be 
stayed   
 
12hast thou commanded the 
morning since thy days began   
and caused the dayspring t o know 
its place   
13that it might take hold of the ends 
of the earth   
and the wicked be shaken out of it   
14it is changed as clay under the 
seal  
and they stand as a garment   
15but from the wicked their light is 
withholden   
and the high arm is broken   
 
16hast thou entered into the springs 
of the sea   
or hast thou walked in the recesses 
of the deep   38 job 
1145

19where is the way to the dwelling 
of light   
and as for darkness  where is the 
place thereof   
20that thou shouldest take it to the 
bound thereof   
and that thou shouldest know the 
paths to the house thereof   
21thou knowest it  for thou wast 
then born   
and the number of thy days is great   
22hast thou entered the treasuries of 
the snow   
or hast thou seen the treasuries of 
the hail   
23which i have reserved against the 
time of trouble   
against the day of battle and war   
 
24by what way is the light parted   
or the east wind scattered upon the 
earth   
25who hath cleft a channel for the 
waterflood   
or a way for the lightning of the 
thunder   
26to cause it to rain on a land where 
no man is   
on the wilderness  wher ein there is 
no man   27to satisfy the desolate and waste 
ground   
and to cause the bud of the tender 
herb to spring forth   
28hath the rain a father   
or who hath begotten the drops of 
dew  
29out of whose womb came the ice   
and the hoar frost of heaven  who 
hath gendered it

heaven   
38when the dust runneth into a  mass

39wilt thou hunt the prey for the 
lioness   
or satisfy the appetite of the young 
lions   
40when they couch in their dens   
and abide in the covert to lie in 
wait  
41who provideth for the raven his 
prey  
when his young ones cry unto god

threshing floor   
 
13the wing of the ostrich beateth 
joyously   
but are her pinions and feathers the 
kindly stork s  
14for she leaveth her eggs on the 
earth   
and warmeth them in dust   
15and forgetteth that the foot may 
crush them   
or that the wild beast may trample 
them   
16she is hardened against her young 
ones as if they were not hers   
though her labour be in vai n she is 
without fear   39 job

 17because god hath deprived her of 
wisdom   
neither hath he imparted to her 
understanding   
18when the time cometh  she raiseth 
her wings on high   
and scorneth the horse and his 
rider   
 
19hast thou given the horse his 
strength   
hast thou clothed his neck with 
fierceness

locust   
the glory of his snorting is terrible   
21he paweth in the valley  and 
rejoiceth in his strength   
he goeth out to meet the clash of 
arms   
22he mocketh at fear  and is  not 
affrighted   
neither turneth he back from the 
sword   
23the quiver rattleth upon him   
the glittering spear and the javelin   
24he swalloweth the ground with 
storm and rage   
neither believeth he that it is the 
voice of the horn   
25as oft as he heare th the horn he 
saith  ha ha   
and he smelleth the battle afar off   
the thunder of the captains  and the 
shouting

moreover the lord answered 
job and said   
2shall he that reproveth contend 
with the almighty   
he that argueth with god  let him 
answer it

what shall i answer thee   
i lay my hand  upon my mouth   
5once have i spoken  but i will not 
answer again   
yea twice  but i will proceed no 
further

like him   
10deck thyself now with majesty 
and excellency   
and array thyself with glory a nd 
beauty   
11cast abroad the rage of thy wrath   
and look upon every one that is 
proud  and abase him

and bring him low   
and tread down the wicked in their 
place   
13hide them in the dust together   
bind their faces i n the hidden place   
14then will i also confess unto thee  
that thine own right hand can save 
thee  
 
15behold now behemoth  which i

and his force is in the stays of his 
body  
17he straineth his tail like a cedar   
the sinews of his thighs are knit 
together   
18his bones are as pipes of brass   
his gristles are like bars of iron   
19he is the beginning of the ways of 
god  
he only that made him can make 
his sword to approa ch unto him   20surely the mountains bring him 
forth food

in the covert of the reed  and fens   
22the lotus trees cover him with 
their shadow   
the willows of the brook compa ss

trembleth not   
he is confident  though the jordan 
rush forth to his mouth   
24shall any take him by his eyes   
or pierce through his nose with a 
snare   
 
25canst thou draw out leviathan with 
a fish hook   
or press down his tongue with a 
cord   
26canst thou put a ring into his 
nose  
or bore his jaw through with a 
hook    
27will he make many supplications 
unto thee   
or will he speak soft words unto 
thee   
28will he make a covenant with 
thee  
that thou sho uldest take him for a 
servant for ever    
29wilt thou play with him as with a 
bird  
or wilt thou bind him for thy 
maidens    job 
1149  
 30will the bands of fishermen make 
a banquet of him   
will they part him among the 
merchants    
31canst thou fill his skin with ba rbed 
irons   
or his head with fish spears    
32lay thy hand upon him   
think upon the battle  thou wilt do 
so no more    
 
behold  the hope of him is in 
 vain

beforehand  that i should repay 
him  
whatsoever is under the whole 
heaven is mine

his boastings   
or his proud talk  or his fair array of

10his sneezings flash forth light   
and his eyes are like the eyelids of 
the morning   
11out of his mouth go burning 
torches   
and sparks o f fire leap forth   
12out of his nostrils goeth smoke   
as out of a seething pot and burning 
rushes   
13his breath kindleth coals   
and a flame goeth out of his mouth   
14in his neck abideth strength   
and dismay danceth before him   
15the flakes of his fl esh are joined 
together   
they are firm upon him  they cannot 
be moved   
16his heart is as firm as a stone   
yea firm as the nether millstone   
17when he raiseth himself up  the 
mighty are afraid   
by reason of despair they are beside 
themselves   
18if on e lay at him with the sword  it 
will not hold   
nor the spear  the dart  nor the 
pointed shaft   
19he esteemeth iron as straw

20the arrow cannot make him flee   
slingstones are turned with him into 
stubble   
21clubs are account ed as stubble   41 job

 he laugheth at the rattling of the 
javelin   
22sharpest potsherds are under him   
he spreadeth a threshing sledge

23he maketh the deep to boil like a 
pot  
he maketh the sea like a seething 
mixture   
24he maketh a path to sh ine after

one would think the deep to be 
hoary   
25upon earth there is not his like  
who is made to be fearless   
26he looketh at all high things   
he is king over all the proud beasts   
 
then job answered the lord 
and said   
2i know that thou can st do every 
thing   
and that no purpose can be 
withholden from thee   
3who is this that hideth counsel 
without knowledge   
therefore have i uttered that which i 
understood not   
things too wonderful for me  which 
i knew not   
4hear  i beseech thee  and i w ill 
speak   
i will demand of thee  and declare 
thou unto me   
5i had heard of thee by the hearing 
of the ear   
but now mine eye seeth thee   
6wherefore i abhor my words  and 
repent   seeing i am dust and ashes   
 
7and it was so  that after the lord 
had spo ken these words unto job  the 
lord said to eliphaz the temanite  
my wrath is kindled against thee  and 
against thy two friends  for ye have not 
spoken of me the thing that is right  as 
my servant job hath  8now therefore  
take unto you seven bullocks and 
seven rams  and go to my servant job  
and offer up for yourselves a burnt 
offering  and my servant job shall 
pray for you  for him will i accept  that 
i do not unto you aught unseemly  for 
ye have not spoken of me the thing 
that is right  as my servant job  hath 
9so eliphaz the temanite and bildad 
the shuhite and zophar the naamathite 
went  and did according as the lord 
commanded them  and the lord 
accepted job  10and the lord changed 
the fortune of job  when he prayed for 
his friends  and the lord gave jo b 
twice as much as he had before  11then 
came there unto him all his brethren  
and all his sisters  and all they that had 
been of his acquaintance before  and 
did eat bread with him in his house  
and they bemoaned him  and 
comforted him concerning all the evil 
that the lord had brought upon him  
every man also gave him a piece of 
money  and every one a ring of gold  
12so the lord blessed the latter end of 
job more than his beginning  and he 
had fourteen thousand sheep  and six 
thousand camels  and a thousan d yoke 
of oxen  and a thousand she asses  42  13he had also seven sons and three 
daughters  14and he called the name of 
the first  ajemimah  and the name of 
the second  bkeziah  and the name of 
the third  ckeren happuch  15and in all 
the land were no women fo und so fair 
as the daughters of job  and their 
father gave them inheritance among 
their brethren  16and after this job 
lived a hundred and forty years  and 
saw his sons  and his sons sons even 
four generations  17so job died  being 
old and full of days

clear as the sun   
terrible as an army with banners   
11i went down into the garden of 
nuts  
to look at the green plants of the 
valley   
to see whether the vine budded   
and the pomegranates were in 
flower   12before i was aware  my soul set

5thy neck is as a tower of ivory   
thine eyes as the pools in heshbon   
by the gate of bath rabbim   
thy nose is like the  tower of 
lebanon  
which looketh toward damascus    
6thy head upon thee is like carmel   
and the hair of thy head like purple   
the king is held captive in the 
tresses thereof    
7how fair and how pleasant art thou   
o love for delights    7 song of song s

 8this thy statu re is like to a palm 
tree  
and thy breasts to clusters of 
grapes    
9i said  i will climb up into the 
palm tree  
i will take hold of the branches 
thereof   
and let thy breasts be as clusters of 
the vine   
and the smell of thy countenance 
like apples    
10and the roof of thy mouth like the 
best wine   
that glideth down smoothly for my 
beloved   
moving gently the lips of those that 
are asleep   
 
11i am my beloved s  
and his desire is toward me    
12come  my beloved  let us go forth 
into the field   
let us lodge in the villages   
13let us get up early to the 
vineyards

budded

opened   
and the pomegranates be in flower   
there will i give thee my love   
14the mandrakes give forth 
fragrance   
and at our doors are all manner of 
precious fruits   
new and old   
which i have laid up for thee  o my 
beloved    
oh that thou wert as my brother   
that sucked the breasts of my 
 mother   
when i should find thee without  i 
would kiss thee   
yea and none would despise me   
2i would lead thee  and bring thee 
into my mother s house   
that thou mightest instruct me   
i would cause thee to drink of 
spiced wine   
of the juice of my pomegranate   
3his left hand should be under my 
head   
and his right hand should  embrace 
me  
4i adjure you  o daughters of 
jerusalem   
why should ye awaken  or stir up 
love  
until it please   
 
5who is this that cometh up from 
the wilderness   
leaning upon her beloved   
under the apple tree i awakened 
thee  
there thy mother was in  travail with 
thee  
there was she in travail and brought 
thee forth   
 
6set me as a seal upon thy heart   
as a seal upon thine arm   
for love is strong as death   
jealousy is cruel as the grave   
the flashes thereof are flashes of 
fire  8 song of song s 
1159  
 a very flame of t he lord  
7many waters cannot quench love   
neither can the floods drown it   
if a man would give all the 
substance of his house for love   
he would utterly be contemned   
8we have a little sister   
and she hath no breasts   
what shall we do for our sister   
in the day when she shall be spoken 
for  
9if she be a wall   
we will build upon her a turret of 
silver   
and if she be a door   
we will enclose her with boards of 
cedar   
 
10i am a wall   
and my breasts like the towers 
thereof   
then was i in his eyes  
as one that found peace   
 11solomon had a vineyard at baal 
hamon   
he gave over the vineyard unto 
keepers   
every one for the fruit thereof  
brought in a thousand pieces of 
silver   
12my vineyard  which is mine  is 
before me   
thou o solomon  shalt have the 
thousand   
and those that keep the fruit thereof 
two hundred   
 
13thou that dwellest in the gardens   
the companions hearken for thy 
voice   
cause me to hear it   
 
14make haste  my beloved   
and be thou like to a gazelle or to a 
young hart  
upon the mountains of spices

and it came to pass in the days 
when the judges judged that there 
was a famine in the land and a certain 
man of bethlehem in judah went to 
sojourn in the field of moab he and 
his wife and his two sons 2and the 
name of the man was elimelech and 
the name of his wife naomi and the 
name of his two sons mahlon and 
chilion ephr athites of bethlehem in 
judah and they came into the field of 
moab and continued there 3and 
elimelech naomis husband died and 
she was left and her two sons 4and 
they took them wives of the women of 
moab the name of the one was orpah 
and the name of the other ruth and 
they dwelt there about  ten years 5and 
mahlon and chilion died both of them 
and the woman was left of her two 
children and of her husb and 6then she 
arose with her daug htersinlaw that 
she might return from the field of 
moab for she had heard in the field of 
moab how that the lord had 
remembered his people in giving them 
bread 7and she went forth out of the 
place where she was and her two 
daughtersinlaw with her and they 
went on the way to return unto the 
land of judah 8and naomi said unto 
her two daughtersinlaw go return 
each of you to her mothers house the 
lord deal kindly with you as ye have 
dealt with the dead and with me 9the lord grant you that ye may find rest 
each of you in the house of her 
husba nd then she kissed them and 
they lifted up their voice and wept 
10and they said unto her nay but we 
will return with thee unto thy peopl e 
11and naomi said turn back my 
daug hters why will ye go with me 
have i yet sons in my womb that they 
may be your husb ands 12turn back 
my daug hters go your way for i am 
too old to have a husb and if i shoul d 
say i have hope  shou ld i even have 
an husba nd tonight and also bear 
sons 13would ye tarry for them till 
they were grown would ye shut 
yourselves off for them and have no 
husba nds nay my daught ers for it 
grieveth me much for your sakes for 
the hand of the lord is gone forth 
against me 14and they lifted up their 
voice and wept again and orpah 
kissed her motherinlaw but ruth 
cleaved unto her 15and she said 
behold thy sisterinlaw is gone back 
unto her people and unto her god 
return thou after thy sisterinlaw 
16and ruth said entreat me not to 
leave thee and to return from 
following after thee for whither thou 
goest i will go and where thou 
lodgest i will lodge thy peopl e shall 
be my peopl e and thy god my god 
17where thou diest will i die and there 
will i be buried the lord do so to me 1 ruth  
1161  
 and more also  if aught but death part 
thee and me  18and when she saw that 
she was stedfastly minded to go with 
her she left off speaking unto her  19so 
they two went until they came to beth 
lehem  and it came to pass  when they 
were come to beth lehem  that all the 
city was astir concerning them  and the 
women said  is this naomi  20and 
she said unto them  call me not 
anaomi  call me bmarah  for the 
almighty hath dealt very bitterly with 
me 21i went out full  and the lord 
hath brought me back home empt y 
why call ye me naomi  seeing the 
lord hath testified against me  and the 
almighty hath afflicted me  22so 
naomi returned  and ruth the 
moabitess  her daughter inlaw with 
her who returned out of the field of 
moab and they came to beth lehem 
in the be ginning of barley harvest   
and naomi had a kinsman of her 
husband s a mighty man of 
valour  of the family of elimelech  and 
his name was boaz  2and ruth the 
moabitess said unto naomi  let me 
now go to the field  and glean among 
the ears of corn after him in whose 
sight i shall find favour  and she said 
unto her  go my daughter  3and she 
went  and came and gleaned in the 
field after the reapers  and her hap was 
to light on the portion of the field 
belonging unto boaz  who was of the 
family of elimel ech 4and behold  
                                                      
a that is pleasant  
b that is bitter  boaz came from beth lehem  and said 
unto the reapers  the lord be with 
you and they answered him  the 
lord bless thee  5then said boaz unto 
his servant that was set over the 
reapers  whose damsel is this  6and 
the servant that was  set over the 
reapers answered and said  it is a 
moabitish damsel that came back with 
naomi out of the field of moab  7and 
she said  let me glean  i pray you  and 
gather after the reapers among the 
sheaves  so she came  and hath 
continued even from the mo rning until 
now save that she tarried a little in the 
house  8then said boaz unto ruth  
hearest thou not  my daughter  go 
not to glean in another field  neither 
pass from hence  but abide here fast by 
my maidens  9let thine eyes be on the 
field that the y do reap  and go thou 
after them  have i not charged the 
young men that they shall not touch 
thee and when thou art athirst  go 
unto the vessels  and drink of that 
which the young men have drawn  
10then she fell on her face  and bowed 
down to the ground  and said unto 
him why have i found favour in thy 
sight  that thou shouldest take 
cognizance of me  seeing i am a 
foreigner  11and boaz answered and 
said unto her  it hath fully been told 
me all that thou hast done unto thy 
mother inlaw since the de ath of thy 
husband  and how thou hast left thy 
father and thy mother  and the land of 
thy nativity  and art come unto a 
people that thou knewest not 2 ruth  
1162  
 heretofore  12the lord recompense thy 
work  and be thy reward complete 
from the lord the god of israel  
under whose wings thou art come to 
take refuge  13then she said  let me 
find favour in thy sight  my lord for 
that thou hast comforted me  and for 
that thou hast spoken to the heart of 
thy handmaid  though i be not as one 
of thy handmaidens  14and boaz s aid 
unto her at meal time come hither  
and eat of the bread  and dip thy 
morsel in the vinegar  and she sat 
beside the reapers  and they reached 
her parched corn  and she did eat and 
was satisfied  and left thereof  15and 
when she was risen up to glean  boaz 
commanded his young men  saying  
let her glean even among the 
sheaves  and put her not to shame  
16and also pull out some for her of 
purpose from the bundles  and leave it  
and let her glean  and rebuke her not  
17so she gleaned in the field until 
even  and she beat out that which she 
had gleaned  and it was about an ephah 
of barley  18and she took it up  and 
went into the city  and her mother in
law saw what she had gleaned  and she 
brought forth and gave to her that 
which she had left after she wa s 
satisfied  19and her mother inlaw said 
unto her  where hast thou gleaned to 
day and where wroughtest thou  
blessed be he that did take knowledge 
of thee  and she told her mother in
law with whom she had wrought  and 
said the man s name with whom i 
wrought to day is boaz  20and naomi said unto her daughter inlaw 
blessed be he of the lord who hath 
not left off his kindness to the living 
and to the dead  and naomi said unto 
her the man is nigh of kin unto us  
one of our near kinsmen  21and rut h 
the moabitess said  yea he said unto 
me thou shalt keep fast by my young 
men until they have ended all my 
harvest  22and naomi said unto ruth 
her daughter inlaw it is good  my 
daughter  that thou go out with his 
maidens  and that thou be not met in 
any other field  23so she kept fast by 
the maidens of boaz to glean unto the 
end of barley harvest and of wheat 
harvest  and she dwelt with her 
mother inlaw  
and naomi her mother inlaw 
said unto her  my daughter  shall 
i not seek rest for thee  that it may be 
well with thee  2and now is there not 
boaz our kinsman  with whose 
maidens thou wast  behold  he 
winnoweth barley to night in the 
threshing floor  3wash thyself 
therefore  and anoint thee  and put thy 
raiment upon thee  and get thee down 
to the threshing floor  but make not 
thyself known unto the man  until he 
shall have done eating and drinking  
4and it shall be  when he lieth down  
that thou shalt mark the place where he 
shall lie  and thou shalt go in  and 
uncover his feet  and lay thee dow n 
and he will tell thee what thou shalt 
do 5and she said unto her  all that 
thou sayest unto me i will do  6and 
she went down unto the threshing 3 ruth  
1163  
 floor  and did according to all that her 
mother inlaw bade her  7and when 
boaz had eaten and drunk  and h is 
heart was merry  he went to lie down 
at the end of the heap of corn  and she 
came softly  and uncovered his feet  
and laid her down  8and it came to 
pass at midnight  that the man was 
startled  and turned himself  and 
behold  a woman lay at his feet  9and 
he said  who art thou  and she 
answered  i am ruth thine handmaid  
spread therefore thy skirt over thy 
handmaid  for thou art a near 
kinsman  10and he said  blessed be 
thou of the lord my daughter  thou 
hast shown more kindness in the end 
than at  the beginning  inasmuch as 
thou didst not follow the young men  
whether poor or rich  11and now  my 
daughter  fear not  i will do to thee all 
that thou sayest  for all the men in the 
gate of my people do know that thou 
art a virtuous woman  12and now it i s 
true that i am a near kinsman  howbeit 
there is a kinsman nearer than i  
13tarry this night  and it shall be in the 
morning  that if he will perform unto 
thee the part of a kinsman  well let 
him do the kinsman s part  but if he be 
not willing to do the part of a kinsman 
to thee  then will i do the part of a 
kinsman to thee  as the lord liveth  lie 
down until the morning  14and she lay 
at his feet until the morning  and she 
rose up before one could discern 
another  for he said  let it not be 
known that the woman came to the 
threshing floor  15and he said  bring the mantle that is upon thee  and hold 
it and she held it  and he measured 
six measures of barley  and laid it on 
her and he went into the city  16and 
when she came to her mother inlaw 
she said who art thou  my daughter  
and she told her all that the man had 
done to her  17and she said  these six 
measures of barley gave he me  for he 
said to me  go not empty unto thy 
mother inlaw 18then said she  sit 
still my daughter  until thou kn ow 
how the matter will fall  for the man 
will not rest  until he have finished the 
thing this day   
now boaz went up to the gate  
and sat him down there  and 
behold  the near kinsman of whom 
boaz spoke came by  unto whom he 
said ho such a one  turn aside  sit 
down here  and he turned aside  and 
sat down  2and he took ten men of the 
elders of the city  and said  sit ye 
down here  and they sat down  3and 
he said unto the near kinsman  
naomi  that is come back out of the 
field of moab  selleth the p arcel of 
land which was our brother 
elimelech s 4and i thought to disclose 
it unto thee  saying  buy it before them 
that sit here  and before the elders of 
my people  if thou wilt redeem it  
redeem it  but if it will not be 
redeemed  then tell me  that i  may 
know  for there is none to redeem it 
beside thee  and i am after thee  and 
he said  i will redeem it  5then said 
boaz  what day thou buyest the field 
of the hand of naomi hast thou also 4 ruth  
1164  
 bought of ruth the moabitess  the wife 
of the dead  to raise up the name of the 
dead upon his inheritance  6and the 
near kinsman said  i cannot redeem it 
for myself  lest i mar mine own 
inheritance  take thou my right of 
redemption on thee  for i cannot 
redeem it  7now this was the 
custom in former time in israe l 
concerning redeeming and concerning 
exchanging  to confirm all things  a 
man drew off his shoe  and gave it to 
his neighbour  and this was the 
attestation in israel  8so the near 
kinsman said unto boaz  buy it for 
thyself  and he drew off his shoe  
9and boaz said unto the elders  and 
unto all the people  ye are witnesses 
this day  that i have bought all that was 
elimelech s and all that was chilion s 
and mahlon s of the hand of naomi  
10moreover ruth the moabitess  the 
wife of mahlon  have i acquire d to be 
my wife  to raise up the name of the 
dead upon his inheritance  that the 
name of the dead be not cut off from 
among his brethren  and from the gate 
of his place  ye are witnesses this day  
11and all the people that were in the 
gate and the elders  said we are 
witnesses  the lord make the woman 
that is come into thy house like rachel 
and like leah  which two did build the 
house of israel  and do thou worthily 
in ephrath  and be famous in beth 
lehem  12and let thy house be like the 
house of perez  whom tamar bore 
unto judah  of the seed which the lord 
shall give thee of this young woman  13so boaz took ruth  and she became 
his wife  and he went in unto her  and 
the lord gave her conception  and she 
bore a son  14and the women said unto 
naomi  blessed be the lord who 
hath not left thee this day without a 
near kinsman  and let his name be 
famous in israel  15and he shall be 
unto thee a restorer of life  and a 
nourisher of thine old age  for thy 
daughter inlaw who loveth thee  who 
is better to the e than seven sons  hath 
borne him  16and naomi took the 
child  and laid it in her bosom  and 
became nurse unto it  17and the 
women her neighbours gave it a name  
saying  there is a son born to 
naomi  and they called his name 
obed  he is the father of je sse the 
father of david  18now these are the 
generations of perez  perez begot 
hezron  19and hezron begot ram  and 
ram begot amminadab  20and 
amminadab begot nahshon  and 
nahshon begot asalmon  21and salmon 
begot boaz  and boaz begot obed  
22and obed bego t jesse  and jesse 
begot david

lamentations  
 
 how doth the city sit solitary   
 that was full of people   
 how is she become as a widow   
 she that was great among the 
nations   
 and princess among the provinces   
 how is she become tributary   
 2she weepeth sore in the night   
 and her tears are on her cheeks   
 she hath none to comfort her  
 among all her lovers   
 all her friends have dealt 
treacherously with her   
 they are become her enemies   
 3judah is gone into exile because of 
affliction   
 and because of great servit ude  
 she dwelleth among the nations   
 she findeth no rest   
 all her pursuers overtook her  
 within the straits   
 4the ways of zion do mourn   
 because none come to the solemn 
assembly   
 all her gates are desolate   
 her priests sigh   
 her virgins a re afflicted   
 and she herself is in bitterness   
 5her adversaries are become the 
head   
 her enemies are at ease   
 for the lord hath afflicted her  
 for the multitude of her 
transgressions    her young children are gone into 
captivity  
 before the adv ersary   
 6and gone is from the daughter of 
zion  
 all her splendour   
 her princes are become like harts  
 that find no pasture   
 and they are gone without strength  
 before the pursuer   
 
 7jerusalem remembereth  
 in the days of her affliction and of 
her anguish  
 all her treasures that she had  
 from the days of old   
 now that her people fall by the hand 
of the adversary   
 and none doth help her   
 the adversaries have seen her   
 they have mocked at her 
desolations   
 8jerusalem hath grievously si nned   
 therefore she is become as one 
unclean   
 all that honoured her despise her   
 because they have seen her 
nakedness   
 she herself also sigheth   
 and turneth backward   
 9her filthiness was in her skirts   
 she was not mindful of her end   
 therefore is she come down 
wonderfully   
 she hath no comforter   1 lamentations  
1166  
  behold  o lord my affliction   
 for the enemy hath magnified 
himself   
 10the adversary hath spread out his 
hand  
 upon all her treasures   
 for she hath seen that the heathen  
 are entered into her sanctuary   
 concerning whom thou didst 
command  
 that they should not enter into thy 
congregation   
 11all her people sigh   
 they seek bread   
 they have given their pleasant 
things for food  
 to refresh the soul   
 see o lord and behold   
 how abject i am become   
 
 12let it not come unto you  all ye 
that pass by   
 behold  and see  
 if there be any pain like unto my 
pain  
 which is done unto me   
 wherewith the lord hath afflicted 
me  
 in the day of his fierce anger   
 13from on high h ath he sent fire  
 into my bones  and it prevaileth 
against them   
 he hath spread a net for my feet   
 he hath turned me back   
 he hath made me desolate  
 and faint all the day   
 14the yoke of my transgressions is 
impressed by his hand   
they are knit together   they are come up upon my neck   
he hath made my strength to fail   
the lord hath delivered me into 
their hands   
against whom i am not able to 
stand   
 15the lord hath set at nought  
all my mighty men in the midst of 
me  
he hath called a solem n assembly 
against me  
to crush my young men   
the lord hath trodden as in a 
winepress  
the virgin the daughter of judah   
 16for these things i weep   
mine eye  mine eye runneth down 
with water   
because the comforter is far from 
me  
even he that shou ld refresh my soul   
my children are desolate   
because the enemy hath prevailed   
 17zion spreadeth forth her hands   
 there is none to comfort her   
 the lord hath commanded 
concerning jacob   
 that they that are round about him 
should be his adversari es  
 jerusalem is among them  
 as one unclean   
 
 18the lord is righteous   
for i have rebelled against his 
word   
hear i pray you  all ye peoples   
 and behold my pain   
 my virgins and my young men  
 are gone into captivity   lamentations  
1167  
  19i called for my love rs  
but they deceived me   
my priests and mine elders  
perished in the city   
while they sought them food  
to refresh their souls   
 20behold  o lord for i am in 
distress   
mine inwards burn   
my heart is turned within me   
for i have grievously rebelle d  
abroad the sword bereaveth   
at home there is the like of death   
 21they have heard that i sigh   
there is none to comfort me   
all mine enemies have heard of my 
trouble  and are glad   
for thou hast done it   
thou wilt bring the day that thou 
hast p roclaimed   
and they shall be like unto me   
 22let all their wickedness come 
before thee   
and do unto them   
as thou hast done unto me  
for all my transgressions   
for my sighs are many  
and my heart is faint   
 
 how hath the lord covered 
 with a cl oud  
the daughter of zion in his anger   
he hath cast down from heaven unto 
the earth  
the beauty of israel   
and hath not remembered his 
footstool  
in the day of his anger    2the lord hath swallowed up 
unsparingly  
all the habitations of jacob   
he hath  thrown down in his wrath  
the strongholds of the daughter of 
judah   
he hath brought them down to the 
ground   
he hath profaned the kingdom and 
the princes thereof   
 3he hath cut off in fierce anger  
all the horn of israel   
he hath drawn back his right  hand  
from before the enemy   
and he hath burned in jacob like a 
flaming fire   
which devoureth round about   
 4he hath bent his bow like an 
enemy   
standing with his right hand as an 
adversary   
and hath slain all that were pleasant 
to the eye   
in the tent of the daughter of zion  
he hath poured out his fury like 
fire  
 5the lord is become as an enemy   
he hath swallowed up israel   
he hath swallowed up all her 
palaces   
he hath destroyed his strongholds   
and he hath multiplied in the 
daughter of jud ah  
mourning and moaning   
 6and he hath stripped his 
tabernacle  as if it were a garden   
he hath destroyed his place of 
assembly   2 lamentations  
1168  
 the lord hath caused to be 
forgotten in zion  
appointed season and sabbath   
and hath rejected in the indignation 
of his a nger  
the king and the priest   
 7the lord hath cast off his altar   
he hath abhorred his sanctuary   
he hath given up into the hand of 
the enemy  
the walls of her palaces   
they have made a noise in the 
house of the lord  
as in the day of a solemn assem bly  
 8the lord hath purposed to destroy  
the wall of the daughter of zion   
he hath stretched out the line   
he hath not withdrawn  
his hand from destroying   
but he hath made the rampart and 
wall to mourn   
they languish together   
 9her gates are sun k into the ground   
he hath destroyed and broken her 
bars  
her king and her princes are among 
the nations   
instruction is no more   
yea her prophets find  
no vision from the lord  
 10they sit upon the ground  and 
keep silence   
the elders of the daugh ter of zion   
they have cast up dust upon their 
heads   
they have girded themselves with 
sackcloth   
the virgins of jerusalem hang down  
their heads to the ground    11mine eyes do fail with tears   
mine inwards burn   
my liver is poured upon the earth   
for the breach of the daughter of my 
people   
because the young children and the 
sucklings swoon  
in the broad places of the city   
 12they say to their mothers   
where is corn and wine   
when they swoon as the wounded  
in the broad places of the city   
when their soul is poured out  
into their mothers bosom   
 13what shall i take to witness for 
thee  
what shall i liken to thee   
o daughter of jerusalem   
what shall i equal to thee  that i 
may comfort thee   
o virgin daughter of zion   
for thy breach i s great like the sea   
who can heal thee   
 14thy prophets have seen visions for 
thee  
of vanity and delusion   
and they have not uncovered thine 
iniquity   
to bring back thy captivity   
but have prophesied for thee 
burdens  
of vanity and seduction   
 15all that pass by clap  
their hands at thee   
they hiss and wag their head  
at the daughter of jerusalem   
is this the city that men called  
the perfection of beauty   
the joy of the whole earth   lamentations  
1169  
  16all thine enemies have opened  
their mouth wide agains t thee   
they hiss and gnash the teeth   
they say  we have swallowed her 
up  
certainly this is the day that we 
looked for   
we have found  we have seen it   
 17the lord hath done that which he 
devised   
he hath performed his word  
that he commanded in the days of 
old  
he hath thrown down unsparingly   
and he hath caused the enemy to 
rejoice over thee   
he hath exalted the horn of thine 
adversaries   
 
 18their heart cried unto the lord   
o wall of the daughter of zion   
let tears run down like a river   
day and night   
give thyself no respite   
let not the apple of thine eye cease   
 19arise  cry out in the night   
at the beginning of the watches   
pour out thy heart like water  
before the face of the lord   
lift up thy hands toward him  
for the life o f thy young children   
that faint for hunger  
at the head of every street   
 20see o lord and consider   
to whom thou hast done thus   
shall the women eat their fruit   
the children that are dandled in the 
hands   shall the priest and the prophet be 
slain  
in the sanctuary of the lord   
 21the youth and the old man lie  
on the ground in the streets   
my virgins and my young men  
are fallen by the sword   
thou hast slain them in the day of 
thine anger   
thou hast slaughtered unsparingly   
 22thou hast  called  as in the day of a 
solemn assembly   
my terrors on every side   
and there was none in the day of the 
lords anger  
that escaped or remained   
those that i have dandled and 
brought up  
hath mine enemy consumed   
 
 
i am the man that hath seen 
 affliction  
by the rod of his wrath   
2he hath led me and caused me to 
walk in darkness and not in light   
3surely against me he turneth his 
hand again and again all the day   
 
4my flesh and my skin hath he 
worn out   
he hath broken my bones   
5he hath bui lded against me  and 
compassed me  
with gall and travail   
6he hath made me to dwell in dark 
places   
as those that have been long dead   
 3 lamentations  
1170  
 7he hath hedged me about  that i 
cannot go forth   
he hath made my chain heavy   
8yea when i cry and call for help  
he shutteth out my prayer   
9he hath enclosed my ways with 
hewn stone   
he hath made my paths crooked   
 
10he is unto me as a bear lying in 
wait  
as a lion in secret places   
11he hath turned aside my ways  and 
pulled me in pieces   
he hath made me deso late  
12he hath bent his bow  and set me  
as a mark for the arrow   
 
13he hath caused the arrows of his 
quiver  
to enter into my reins   
14i am become a derision to all my 
people   
and their song all the day   
15he hath filled me with bitterness   
he hat h sated me with wormwood   
 
16he hath also broken my teeth with 
gravel stones   
he hath made me to wallow in 
ashes   
17and my soul is removed far off 
from peace   
i forgot prosperity   
18and i said  my strength is 
perished   
and mine expectation from the  
lord  
 19remember mine affliction and 
mine anguish   
the wormwood and the gall   
20my soul hath them still in 
remembrance   
and is bowed down within me   
21this i recall to my mind  
therefore have i hope   
 
22surely the l ords mercies are not 
consumed   
surely his compassions fail not   
23they are new every morning   
great is thy faithfulness   
24the lord is my portion  saith my 
soul  
therefore will i hope in him   
 
25the lord is good unto them that 
wait for him   
to the soul that seeketh him   
26it is good that a man should 
quietly wait  
for the salvation of the lord  
27it is good for a man that he bear   
the yoke in his youth   
 
28let him sit alone and keep silence   
because he hath laid it upon him   
29let him put his mouth in the dust   
if so be there may be hope   
30let him give his cheek to him that 
smiteth him  
let him be filled full with reproach   
 
31for the lord will not cast off  
for ever   
32for though he cause grief  yet will 
he have compassion  lamentations  
1171  
 according to the multitude of his 
mercies  
33for he doth not afflict willingly   
nor grieve the children of men   
 
34to crush under foot  
all the prisoners of the earth   
35to turn aside the right of a man  
before the face of the most high   
36to subvert a man in his cause   
the lord approv eth not   
 
37who is he that saith  and it cometh 
to pass   
when the lord commandeth it not   
38out of the mouth of the most high 
proceedeth not  
evil and good   
39wherefore doth a living man 
complain   
a strong man because of his sins   
 
40let us search and try our ways   
and return to the lord  
41let us lift up our heart with our 
hands  
unto god in the heavens   
42we have transgressed and have 
rebelled   
thou hast not pardoned   
 
43thou hast covered with anger and 
pursued us   
thou hast slain unsparing ly  
44thou hast covered thyself with a 
cloud   
so that no prayer can pass through   
45thou hast made us as the 
offscouring and refuse  in the midst of the peoples   
 
46all our enemies have opened their 
mouth  
wide against us   
47terror and the pit are co me upon 
us  
desolation and destruction   
48mine eye runneth down with rivers 
of water   
for the breach of the daughter of my 
people   
 
49mine eye is poured out  and 
ceaseth not   
without any intermission   
50till the lord look forth   
and behold from hea ven  
51mine eye affected my soul   
because of all the daughters of my 
city  
 
52they have chased me sore like a 
bird  
that are mine enemies without 
cause   
53they have cut off my life in the 
dungeon   
and have cast stones upon me   
54waters flowed over my head   
i said  i am cut off   
 
55i called upon thy name  o lord  
out of the lowest dungeon   
56thou heardest my voice  hide not  
thine ear at my sighing  at my cry   
57thou drewest near in the day that i 
called upon thee   
thou saidst  fear not   lamentations  
1172  
  
58o lord  thou hast pleaded the 
causes of my soul   
thou hast redeemed my life   
59o lord thou hast seen my 
wrong   
judge thou my cause   
60thou hast seen all their vengeance  
and all their devices against me   
 
61thou hast heard their taunt  o 
lord  
and all their devices against me   
62the lips of those that rose up 
against me   
and their muttering against me all 
the day   
63behold thou their sitting down  
and their rising up   
i am their song   
 
64thou wilt render unto them a 
recompense  o lord  
according to the work of their 
hands   
65thou wilt give them hardness of 
heart   
thy curse unto them   
66thou wilt pursue them in anger  
and destroy them  
from under the heavens of the lord  
 
 how  is the gold become dim   
how is the most fine gold     
 changed   
the hallowed stones are poured out  
at the head of every street   
 2the precious sons of zion   
comparable to fine gold   how are they esteemed as earthen 
pitchers   
the work of the hands of the potter   
 3even the jackals draw out the 
breast   
they give suck to their young ones   
the daughter of my people is 
become cruel   
like the ostriches in the wilderness   
 4the tongue of the sucking child 
cleaveth  
to the roof of his mouth for thirst   
the young children ask bread   
and none breaketh it unto them   
 5they that did feed on dainties  
are desolate in the streets   
they that were brought up in scarlet   
embrace dunghills   
 6for the iniquity of the daughter of 
my people is greater  
than the sin of sodom   
that was overthrown as in a 
moment   
and no hands fell upon her   
 7her princes were purer than snow   
they were whiter than milk   
they were more ruddy in body than 
rubies   
their polishing was as of sapphire   
 8their visage is blacker than a coal   
they are not known in the streets   
their skin is shrivelled upon their 
bones   
it is withered  it is become like a 
stick   
 9they that are slain with the sword 
are better  
than they that are slain with hunger   4 lamentations  
1173  
 for these pine away  stricken 
through   
for want of the fruits of the field   
 10the hands of women full of 
compassion  
have sodden their own children   
they were their food  
in the destruction of the daughter of 
my people   
 
 11the lord hath accomplished his 
fury  
he hath poured out his fierce anger   
and he hath kindled a fire in  zion   
which hath devoured the 
foundations thereof   
 12the kings of the earth believed 
not  
neither all the inhabitants of the 
world   
that the adversary and the enemy 
would enter  
into the gates of jerusalem   
 13it is because of the sins of her 
prophets  
and the iniquities of her priests   
that have shed the blood of the just  
in the midst of her   
 14they wander as blind men in the 
streets   
they are polluted with blood   
so that men cannot  
touch their garments   
 15depart ye  unclean   men cr ied 
unto them   
depart  depart  touch not   
yea they fled away and wandered   
men said among the nations   
they shall no more sojourn here    16the anger of the lord hath divided 
them   
he will no more regard them   
they respected not the persons of 
the priests   
they were not gracious unto the 
elders   
 
 17as for us  our eyes do yet fail  
for our vain help   
in our watching we have watched  
for a nation that could not save   
 18they hunt our steps   
that we cannot go in our broad 
places   
our end i s near  our days are 
fulfilled   
for our end is come   
 19our pursuers were swifter  
than the eagles of the heaven   
they chased us upon the mountains   
they lay in wait for us in the 
wilderness   
 20the breath of our nostrils  the 
anointed of the lord  
was taken in their pits   
of whom we said  under his 
shadow  
we shall live among the nations   
 21rejoice and be glad  o daughter of 
edom   
that dwellest in the land of uz   
the cup shall pass over unto thee 
also  
thou shalt be drunken  and shalt 
make  thyself naked   
 22the punishment of thine iniquity is 
accomplished  o daughter of 
zion   lamentations  
1174  
 he will no more carry thee away 
into captivity   
he will punish thine iniquity  o 
daughter of edom   
he will uncover thy sins   
 
remember  o lord what is come 
 upon us   
behold  and see our reproach   
2our inheritance is turned unto 
strangers   
our houses unto aliens   
3we are become orphans and 
fatherless   
our mothers are as widows   
4we have drunk our water for 
money   
our wood cometh to us for price   
5to our very necks we are pursued   
we labour  and have no rest   
6we have given the hand to egypt   
and to assyria  to have bread 
enough   
7our fathers have sinned  and are 
not  
and we have borne their iniquities   
8servants rule over us   
there is none to deliv er us out of 
their hand   
9we get our bread with the peril of 
our lives  
because of the sword of the 
wilderness   
10our skin is hot like an oven  
because of the burning heat of 
famine   
11they have ravished the women in 
zion   
the maidens in the cities of judah   12princes are hanged up by their 
hand   
the faces of elders are not 
honoured   
13the young men have borne the 
mill  
and the children have stumbled 
under the wood   
14the elders have ceased from the 
gate  
the young men from their music   
15the joy  of our heart is ceased   
our dance is turned into mourning   
16the crown is fallen from our head   
woe unto us  for we have sinned   
 
17for this our heart is faint   
for these things our eyes are dim   
18for the mountain of zion  which is 
desolate   
the foxes walk upon it   
19thou  o lord art enthroned for 
ever  
thy throne is from generation to 
generation   
20wherefore dost thou forget us for 
ever  
and forsake us so long time   
21turn thou us unto thee  o lord 
and we shall be turned   
renew our days as  of old   
22thou canst not have utterly 
rejected us   
and be exceeding wroth against us   
 
turn us unto thee o lord and we shall be 
turned  
renew our days as of old  5   
  
ecclesiastes  
 
the words of the koheleth  the 
son of david  king in jerusalem   
 
2vanity of vanities  saith koheleth   
vanity of vanities  all is vanity   
 
3what profit hath man of all his 
labour  
wherein he laboureth under the 
sun  
4one generation passeth away  and 
another generation cometh   
and the earth abideth for ever   
5the s un also ariseth   
and the sun goeth down   
and hasteth to his place where he 
ariseth   
6the wind goeth toward the south   
and turneth about unto the north   
it turneth about continually in its 
circuit   
and the wind returneth again to its 
circuits   
7all the rivers run into the sea   
yet the sea is not full   
unto the place whither the rivers go   
thither they go again   
8all things toil to weariness   
man cannot utter it   
the eye is not satisfied with seeing   
nor the ear filled with hearing   
9that which  hath been is that which 
shall be   and that which hath been done is 
that which shall be done   
and there is nothing new under the 
sun  
10is there a thing whereof it is said  
see this is new it hath been 
already  in the ages which were before 
us 11there is no remembrance of them 
of former times  neither shall there be 
any remembrance of them of latter 
times that are to come  among those 
that shall come after   
 
12i koheleth have been king over 
israel in jerusalem  13and i applied my 
heart to seek and to search out by 
wisdom concerning all things that are 
done under heaven  it is a sore task 
that god hath given to the sons of men 
to be exercised therewith  14i have seen 
all the works that are done under the 
sun and behold  all is vanity and a 
striving  after wind   
15that which is crooked cannot be 
made straight   
and that which is wanting cannot be 
numbered   
16i spoke with my own heart  saying  
lo i have gotten great wisdom  more 
also than all that were before me over 
jerusalem  yea my heart hath had 
great experience of wisdom and 
knowledge  17and i applied my heart 
to know wisdom  and to know 1 ecclesiastes  
1176  
 madness and folly i perceived that 
this also was a striving after wind   
18for in much wisdom is much 
vexation   
and he that increaseth knowledge 
increaseth sorrow   
 
i said in my heart  come now  i 
will try thee with mirth  and enjoy 
pleasure  and behold  this also was 
vanity  2i said of laughter  it is mad  
and of mirth  what doth it 
accomplish  3i searched in my heart 
how to pamper my flesh with wi ne 
and my heart conducting itself with 
wisdom  how yet to lay hold on folly  
till i might see which it was best for 
the sons of men that they should do 
under the heaven the few days of their 
life 4i made me great works  i builded 
me houses  i planted me  vineyards  5i 
made me gardens and parks  and i 
planted trees in them of all kinds of 
fruit 6i made me pools of water  to 
water therefrom the wood springing up 
with trees  7i acquired men servants 
and maid servants  and had servants 
born in my house  also i had great 
possessions of herds and flocks  above 
all that were before me in jerusalem  8i 
gathered me also silver and gold  and 
treasure such as kings and the 
provinces have as their own  i got me 
mensingers and women singers  and 
the delights of the s ons of men  
women very many  9so i was great  
and increased more than all that were 
before me in jerusalem  also my 
wisdom stood me in stead  10and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept 
not from them  i withheld not my heart 
from any joy  for my heart had jo y of 
all my labour  and this was my portion 
from all my labour  11then i looked on 
all the works that my hands had 
wrought  and on the labour that i had 
laboured to do  and behold  all was 
vanity and a striving after wind  and 
there was no profit under th e sun   
12and i turned myself to behold 
wisdom  and madness and folly  for 
what can the man do that cometh after 
the king  even that which hath been 
already done  13then i saw that 
wisdom excelleth folly  as far as light 
excelleth darkness   
14the wise man  his eyes are in his 
head   
but the fool walketh in darkness   
and i also perceived that one event 
happeneth to them all  15then said i in 
my heart  as it happeneth to the fool  
so will it happen even to me  and why 
was i then more wise  then i said in 
my heart  that this also is vanity  16for 
of the wise man  even as of the fool  
there is no remembrance for ever  
seeing that in the days to come all will 
long ago have been forgotten  and 
how must the wise man die even as the 
fool 17so i hated life  because the 
work that is wrought under the sun 
was grievous unto me  for all is vanity 
and a striving after wind   
18and i hated all my labour wherein 
i laboured under the sun  seeing that i 
must leave it unto the man that shall be 
after me  19and who knoweth whether 2 ecclesiastes  
1177  
 he will be a wise man or a fool  yet 
will he have rule over all my labour 
wherein i have laboured  and wherein i 
have shown myself wise under the sun  
this also is vanity  20therefore i 
turned about to cause my heart to 
despair concerning all the l abour 
wherein i had laboured under the sun  
21for there is a man whose labour is 
with wisdom  and with knowledge  
and with skill  yet to a man that hath 
not laboured therein shall he leave it 
for his portion  this also is vanity and 
a great evil  22for wha t hath a man of 
all his labour  and of the striving of his 
heart  wherein he laboureth under the 
sun 23for all his days are pains  and 
his occupation vexation  yea even in 
the night his heart taketh not rest  this 
also is vanity   
24there is nothing bett er for a man 
than that he should eat and drink  and 
make his soul enjoy pleasure for his 
labour  this also i saw  that it is from 
the hand of god  25for who will eat  or 
who will enjoy  if not i  26for to the 
man that is good in his sight he giveth 
wisdom  and knowledge  and joy  but 
to the sinner he giveth the task  to 
gather and to heap up  that he may 
leave to him that is good in the sight of 
god this also is vanity and a striving 
after wind   
to every thing there is a season  
and a time to every purp ose under 
the heaven   
2a time to be born  and a time to 
die  a time to plant  and a time to pluck 
up that which is planted   
3a time to kill  and a time to heal   
a time to break down  and a time to 
build up   
4a time to weep  and a time to 
laugh   
a time to mourn  and a time to 
dance   
5a time to cast away stones  and a 
time to gather stones together   
a time to embrace  and a time to 
refrain from embracing   
6a time to seek  and a time to lose   
a time to keep  and a time to cast 
away   
7a time to rend  and a time to sew   
a time to keep silence  and a time to 
speak   
8a time to love  and a time to hate   
a time for war  and a time for 
peace   
9what profit hath he that worketh in 
that he laboureth  10i have seen the 
task which god hath given to the sons 
of men to be exercised therewith  11he 
hath made every thing beautiful in its 
time also he hath set the world in 
their heart  yet so that man cannot find 
out the work that god hath done from 
the beginning even to the end  12i 
know that there is nothing be tter for 
them  than to rejoice  and to get 
pleasure so long as they live  13but 
also that every man should eat and 
drink  and enjoy pleasure for all his 
labour  is the gift of god  14i know 
that whatsoever god doeth  it shall be 
for ever  nothing can be a dded to it  3 ecclesiastes  
1178  
 nor any thing taken from it  and god 
hath so made it  that men should fear 
before him  15that which is hath been 
long ago  and that which is to be hath 
already been  and god seeketh that 
which is pursued   
16and moreover i saw under the sun  
in the place of justice  that wickedness 
was there  and in the place of 
righteousness  that wickedness was 
there  17i said in my heart  the 
righteous and the wicked god will 
judge  for there is a time there for 
every purpose and for every work  18i 
said in  my heart  it is because of the 
sons of men  that god may sift them  
and that they may see that they 
themselves are but as beasts  19for 
that which befalleth the sons of men 
befalleth beasts  even one thing 
befalleth them  as the one dieth  so 
dieth the other  yea they have all one 
breath  so that man hath no pre 
eminence above a beast  for all is 
vanity  20all go unto one place  all are 
of the dust  and all return to dust  
21who knoweth the spirit of man 
whether it goeth upward  and the spirit 
of the be ast whether it goeth 
downward to the earth  22wherefore i 
perceived that there is nothing better  
than that a man should rejoice in his 
works  for that is his portion  for who 
shall bring him to see what shall be 
after him   
but i returned and considered  all 
the oppressions that are done 
under the sun  and behold the tears of 
such as were oppressed  and they had no comforter  and on the side of their 
oppressors there was power  but they 
had no comforter  2wherefore i praised 
the dead that are already dead  more 
than the living that are yet alive  3but 
better than they both is he that hath not 
yet been  who hath not seen the evil 
work that is done under the sun   
4again  i considered all labour and 
all excelling in work  that it is a man s 
rivalry with his n eighbour  this also is 
vanity and a striving after wind   
5the fool foldeth his hands together   
and eateth his own flesh   
6better is a handful of quietness   
than both the hands full of labour 
and striving after wind   
7then i returned and saw vanity 
under the sun  8there is one that is 
alone  and he hath not a second  yea 
he hath neither son nor brother  yet is 
there no end of all his labour  neither is 
his eye satisfied with riches  for 
whom then do i labour  and bereave 
my soul of pleasure  this als o is 
vanity  yea it is a grievous business  
9two are better than one  because they 
have a good reward for their labour  
10for if they fall  the one will lift up 
his fellow  but woe to him that is alone 
when he falleth  and hath not another 
to lift him up  11again  if two lie 
together  then they have warmth  but 
how can one be warm alone  12and if 
a man prevail against him that is alone  
two shall withstand him  and a 
threefold cord is not quickly broken   
13better is a poor and wise child 
than an old and f oolish king  who 4 ecclesiastes  
1179  
 knoweth not how to receive 
admonition any more  14for out of 
prison he came forth to be king  
although in his kingdom he was born 
poor 15i saw all the living that walk 
under the sun  that they were with the 
child  the second  that was to stand up 
in his stead  16there was no end of all 
the people  even of all them whom he 
did lead  yet they that come after shall 
not rejoice in him  surely this also is 
vanity and a striving after wind   
17guard thy foot when thou goest to 
the house of god  and be ready to 
hearken  it is better than when fools 
give sacrifices  for they know not that 
they do evil    
be not rash with thy mouth  and 
let not thy heart be hasty to utter a 
word before god  for god is in 
heaven  and thou upon earth  therefore 
let thy words be few    
2for a dream cometh through a 
multitude of business   
and a fool s voice through a 
multitude of words    
3when thou vowest a vow unto god  
defer not to pay it  for he hath no 
pleasure in fools  pay that which thou 
vowest   4better is it  that thou 
shouldest not vow  than that thou 
shouldest vow and not pay   5suffer 
not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into 
guilt neither say thou before the 
messenger  that it was an error  
wherefore should god be angry at thy 
voice  and destroy the work of t hy 
hands   6for through the multitude of dreams and vanities there are also 
many words  but fear thou god    
7if thou seest the oppression of the 
poor and the violent perverting of 
justice and righteousness in the state  
marvel not at the matter  for one 
higher than the high watcheth  and 
there are higher than they   8but the 
profit of a land every way is a king 
that maketh himself servant to the 
field  
9he that loveth silver shall not be 
satisfied with silver  nor he that loveth 
abundance  with increase  this also is 
vanity   10when goods increase  they 
are increased that eat them  and what 
advantage is there to the owner 
thereof  saving the beholding of them 
with his eyes   
11sweet is the sleep of a labouring 
man whether he eat little or much  but 
the s atiety of the rich will not suffer 
him to sleep   
12there is a grievous evil which i 
have seen under the sun  namely  
riches kept by the owner thereof to his 
hurt 13and those riches perish by evil 
adventure  and if he hath begotten a 
son there is nothing  in his hand  14as 
he came forth of his mother s womb  
naked shall he go back as he came  and 
shall take nothing for his labour  which 
he may carry away in his hand  15and 
this also is a grievous evil  that in all 
points as he came  so shall he go  and 
what profit hath he that he laboureth 
for the wind  16all his days also he 
eateth in darkness  and he hath much 
vexation and sickness and wrath   5 ecclesiastes  
1180  
 17behold that which i have seen  it is 
good  yea it is comely for one to eat 
and to drink  and to enjoy pleasure  for 
all his labour  wherein he laboureth 
under the sun  all the days of his life 
which god hath given him  for this is 
his portion  18every man also to whom 
god hath given riches and wealth  and 
hath given him power to eat thereof  
and to take his portion  and to rejoice 
in his labour this is the gift of god  
19for let him remember the days of his 
life that they are not many  for god 
answereth him in the joy of his heart   
there is an evil which i have seen 
under the sun  and it is heavy 
upon men  2a man  to whom god 
giveth riches  wealth  and honour  so 
that he wanteth nothing for his soul of 
all that he desireth  yet god giveth him 
not power to eat thereof  but a stranger 
eateth it  this is vanity  and it is an evil 
disease  3if a man beget a hundred 
children  and live many years  so that 
the days of his years are many  but his 
soul have not enough of good  and 
moreover he have no burial  i say  that 
an untimely birth is better than he  4for 
it cometh in vanity  and departeth in 
darkness  and the name the reof is 
covered with darkness  5moreover it 
hath not seen the sun nor known it  
this hath gratification rather than the 
other  6yea though he live a thousand 
years twice told  and enjoy no good  
do not all go to one place   
7all the labour of man is for h is 
mouth   
and yet the appetite is not filled   8for what advantage hath the wise 
more than the fool  or the poor man 
that hath understanding  in walking 
before the living  9better is the seeing 
of the eyes than the wandering of the 
desire  this also is va nity and a striving 
after wind   
10whatsoever cometh into being  the 
name thereof was given long ago  and 
it is foreknown what man is  neither 
can he contend with him that is 
mightier than he  11seeing there are 
many words that increase vanity  what 
is man  the better  12for who knoweth 
what is good for man in his life  all the 
days of his vain life which he spendeth 
as a shadow  for who can tell a man 
what shall be after him under the sun   
 
a good name is better than 
 precious oil   
and the day of death than the day of 
ones birth   
2it is better to go to the house of 
mourning   
than to go to the house of feasting   
for that is the end of all men   
and the living will lay it to his 
heart   
3vexation is better than laughter   
for by the sadness of the 
coun tenance the heart may be 
gladdened   
4the heart of the wise is in the 
house of mourning   
but the heart of fools is in the house 
of mirth   
5it is better to hear the rebuke of the 
wise  6 
7 ecclesiastes  
1181  
 than for a man to hear the song of 
fools   
6for as the crackling of t horns under 
a pot  so is the laughter of the 
fool this also is vanity   
7surely oppression turneth a wise 
man into a fool   
and a gift destroyeth the 
understanding   
8better is the end of a thing than the 
beginning thereof   
and the patient in spirit is b etter 
than the proud in spirit   
9be not hasty in thy spirit to be 
angry   
for anger resteth in the bosom of 
fools   
10say not thou  how was it that the 
former days were better than these  
for it is not out of wisdom that thou 
inquirest concerning this   
11wisdom is good with an 
inheritance   
yea a profit to them that see the 
sun  
12for wisdom is a defence  even as 
money is a defence  but the excellency 
of knowledge is  that wisdom 
preserveth the life of him that hath it   
13consider the work of god  for 
who can make that straight  which he 
hath made crooked  14in the day of 
prosperity be joyful  and in the day of 
adversity consider  god hath made 
even the one as well as the other  to 
the end that man should find nothing 
after him   
15all things have i s een in the days 
of my vanity  there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness  and 
there is a wicked man that prolongeth 
his life in his evil doing  16be not 
righteous overmuch  neither make 
thyself overwise  why shouldest thou 
destroy thyself  17be not overmuch 
wicked  neither be thou foolish  why 
shouldest thou die before thy time  18it 
is good that thou shouldest take hold 
of the one  yea also from the other 
withdraw not thy hand  for he that 
feareth god shall discharge himself of 
them all   
19wisdom is a stronghold to the 
wise man more than ten rulers that are 
in a city  20for there is not a righteous 
man upon earth  that doeth good  and 
sinneth not   
21also take not heed unto all words 
that are spoken  lest thou hear thy 
servant curse thee  22for oftentimes 
also thine own heart knoweth that thou 
thyself likewise hast cursed others   
23all this have i tried by wisdom  i 
said i will get wisdom  but it was far 
from me  24that which is is far off  and 
exceeding deep  who can find it out  
25i turned about  and applied my heart 
to know and to search out  and to seek 
wisdom and the reason of things  and 
to know wickedness to be folly  and 
foolishness to be madness  26and i find 
more bitter than death the woman  
whose heart is snares and nets  and her 
hands as bands  whoso pleaseth god 
shall escape from her  but the sinner 
shall be taken by her  27behold  this 
have i found  saith koheleth  adding 
one thing to another  to find out the ecclesiastes  
1182  
 account  28which yet my soul sought  
but i found not  one man am ong a 
thousand have i found  but a woman 
among all those have i not found  
29behold  this only have i found  that 
god made man upright  but they have 
sought out many inventions   
 
who is as the wise man  and who 
knoweth the interpretation of a 
thing   
a mans wisdom maketh his face to 
shine   
and the boldness of his face is 
changed   
2i counsel thee  keep the king s 
command  and that in regard of the 
oath of god  3be not hasty to go out of 
his presence  stand not in an evil thing  
for he doeth whatsoeve r pleaseth him  
4forasmuch as the king s word hath 
power  and who may say unto him  
what doest thou   
5whoso keepeth the commandment 
shall know no evil thing   
and a wise man s heart discerneth 
time and judgment   
6for to every matter there is a time and  
judgment  for the evil of man is great 
upon him  7for he knoweth not that 
which shall be  for even when it 
cometh to pass  who shall declare it 
unto him  8there is no man that hath 
power over the wind to retain the 
wind  neither hath he power over the 
day of death  and there is no discharge 
in war  neither shall wickedness 
deliver him that is given to it  9all this 
have i seen  even applied my heart thereto  whatever the work that is done 
under the sun  what time one man had 
power over another to his hurt   
10and so i saw the wicked buried  and 
they entered into their rest  but they 
that had done right went away from 
the holy place  and were forgotten in 
the city  this also is vanity  11because 
sentence against an evil work is not 
executed speedily  therefo re the heart 
of the sons of men is fully set in them 
to do evil  12because a sinner doeth 
evil a hundred times  and prolongeth 
his days though yet i know that it 
shall be well with them that fear god  
that fear before him  13but it shall not 
be well with t he wicked  neither shall 
he prolong his days  which are as a 
shadow  because he feareth not before 
god 14there is a vanity which is done 
upon the earth  that there are righteous 
men unto whom it happeneth 
according to the work of the wicked  
again  there  are wicked men  to whom 
it happeneth according to the work of 
the righteous i said that this also is 
vanity  15so i commended mirth  that a 
man hath no better thing under the sun  
than to eat  and to drink  and to be 
merry  and that this should accompany 
him in his labour all the days of his life 
which god hath given him under the 
sun  
16when i applied my heart to know 
wisdom  and to see the business that is 
done upon the earth for neither day 
nor night do men see sleep with their 
eyes17then i beheld all  the work of 
god that man cannot find out the 8 ecclesiastes  
1183  
 work that is done under the sun  
because though a man labour to seek it 
out yet he shall not find it  yea further  
though a wise man think to know it  
yet shall he not be able to find it   
for all this i la id to my heart  
even to make clear all this  that 
the righteous  and the wise  and their 
works  are in the hand of god  whether 
it be love or hatred  man knoweth it 
not all is before them  2all things 
come alike to all  there is one event to 
the righteous  and to the wicked  to the 
good and to the clean and to the 
unclean  to him that sacrificeth and to 
him that sacrificeth not  as is the good  
so is the sinner  and he that sweareth  
as he that feareth an oath  3this is an 
evil in all that is done under the  sun 
that there is one event unto all  yea 
also the heart of the sons of men is 
full of evil  and madness is in their 
heart while they live  and after that 
they go to the dead   
4for to him that is joined to all the 
living there is hope  for a living dog  is 
better than a dead lion  5for the living 
know that they shall die  but the dead 
know not any thing  neither have they 
any more a reward  for the memory of 
them is forgotten  6as well their love  
as their hatred and their envy  is long 
ago perished  neither have they any 
more a portion for ever in any thing 
that is done under the sun   
 
7go thy way  eat thy bread with joy   
and drink thy wine with a merry 
heart   for god hath already accepted thy 
works   
8let thy garments be always white   
and let thy he ad lack no oil   
9enjoy life with the wife whom thou 
lovest all the days of the life of thy 
vanity  which he hath given thee 
under the sun  all the days of thy 
vanity  for that is thy portion in life  
and in thy labour wherein thou 
labourest under the sun  10whatsoever 
thy hand attaineth to do by thy 
strength  that do  for there is no work  
nor device  nor knowledge  nor 
wisdom  in the grave  whither thou 
goest   
11i returned  and saw under the sun  
that the race is not to the swift  nor the 
battle to the s trong  neither yet bread 
to the wise  nor yet riches to men of 
understanding  nor yet favour to men 
of skill  but time and chance 
happeneth to them all  12for man also 
knoweth not his time  as the fishes that 
are taken in an evil net  and as the 
birds that  are caught in the snare  even 
so are the sons of men snared in an 
evil time  when it falleth suddenly 
upon them   
13this also have i seen as wisdom 
under the sun  and it seemed great unto 
me 14there was a little city  and few 
men within it  and there cam e a great 
king against it  and besieged it  and 
built great bulwarks against it  15now 
there was found in it a man poor and 
wise and he by his wisdom delivered 
the city  yet no man remembered that 
same poor man  16then said i  9 ecclesiastes  
1184  
 wisdom is better than stren gth 
nevertheless the poor man s wisdom is 
despised  and his words are not heard   
17the words of the wise spoken in 
quiet  
are more acceptable than the cry of 
a ruler among fools   
18wisdom is better than weapons of 
war  
but one sinner destroyeth much 
good  
dead flies make the ointment 
 of the perfumer fetid and  
   putrid   
so doth a little folly outweigh 
wisdom and honour   
2a wise man s understanding is at 
his right hand   
but a fool s understanding at his 
left 3yea also  when a fool walketh by 
the way  his understanding faileth him  
and he saith to every one that he is a 
fool  
 
4if the spirit of the ruler rise up 
against thee   
leave not thy place   
for gentleness allayeth great 
offences   
5there is an evil which i have seen 
under the sun   
like an error which proceedeth 
from a ruler   
6folly is set on great heights   
and the rich sit in low place   
7i have seen servants upon horses   
and princes walking as servants 
upon the earth   
 8he that diggeth a pit shall fall into 
it  
and whoso breaketh through a 
fence  a serpent shall bite him   
9whoso quarrieth stones shall be 
hurt therewith   
and he that cleaveth wood is 
endangered thereby   
10if the iron be blunt   
and one do not whet the edge   
then must he put to more strength   
but wisdom is profit able to direct   
11if the serpent bite before it is 
charmed   
then the charmer hath no 
advantage   
 
12the words of a wise man s mouth 
are gracious   
but the lips of a fool will swallow 
up himself   
13the beginning of the words of his 
mouth is foolishness   
and the end of his talk is grievous 
madness   
14a fool also multiplieth words   
yet man knoweth not what shall be   
and that which shall be after him   
who can tell him   
15the labour of fools wearieth every 
one of them   
for he knoweth not how to go to t he 
city  
 
16woe to thee  o land  when thy 
king is a boy   
and thy princes feast in the 
morning   10 ecclesiastes  
1185  
 17happy art thou  o land  when thy 
king is a free man   
and thy princes eat in due season   
in strength  and not in drunkenness   
 
18by slothfulness the rafte rs sink in   
and through idleness of the hands 
the house leaketh   
 
19a feast is made for laughter   
and wine maketh glad the life   
and money answereth all things   
 
20curse not the king  no not in thy 
thought   
and curse not the rich in thy 
bedchamber   
for a bird of the air shall carry the 
voice   
and that which hath wings shall tell 
the matter   
 
cast thy bread upon the 
 waters   
for thou shalt find it after many 
days  
2divide a portion into seven  yea 
even into eight   
for thou knowest not what e vil shall 
be upon the earth   
3if the clouds be full of rain   
they empty themselves upon the 
earth   
and if a tree fall in the south  or in 
the north   
in the place where the tree falleth  
there shall it be   
4he that observeth the wind shall 
not sow   and he that regardeth the clouds 
shall not reap   
5as thou knowest not what is the 
way of the wind   
nor how the bones do grow in the 
womb of her that is with child   
even so thou knowest not the work 
of god  
who doeth all things   
6in the morning sow thy se ed  
and in the evening withhold not thy 
hand   
for thou knowest not which shall 
prosper  whether this or that   
or whether they both shall be alike 
good   
7and the light is sweet   
and a pleasant thing it is for the 
eyes to behold the sun   
8for if a man live many years   
let him rejoice in them all   
and remember the days of darkness   
for they shall be many   
all that cometh is vanity   
 
9rejoice  o young man  in thy 
youth   
and let thy heart cheer thee in the 
days of thy youth   
and walk in the ways of thy heart   
and in the sight of thine eyes   
but know thou  that for all these 
things  
god will bring thee into judgment   
10therefore remove vexation from 
thy heart   
and put away evil from thy flesh   
for childhood and youth are vanity   
 11 ecclesiastes  
1186  
 remember the n thy creator in 
the days of thy youth   
before the evil days come   
and the years draw nigh  when thou 
shalt say   
i have no pleasure in them   
2before the sun  and the light  and 
the moon   
and the stars  are darkened   
and the clouds return after the rain  
3in the day when the keepers of the 
house shall tremble   
and the strong men shall bow 
themselves   
and the grinders cease because they 
are few   
and those that look out shall be 
darkened in the windows   
4and the doors shall be shut in the 
street   
when the sound of the grinding is 
low  
and one shall start up at the voice of 
a bird   
and all the daughters of music shall 
be brought low   
5also when they shall be afraid of 
that which is high

and the almond tree sha ll blossom

esther  
 
now it came to pass in the days of 
ahasuerus this is ahasuerus 
who reigned  from india even unto 
ethiopia  over a hundred and seven 
and twenty provinces  2that in t hose 
days when the king ahasuerus sat on 
the throne of his kingdom  which was 
in shushan the castle  3in the third year 
of his reign  he made a feast unto all 
his princes and his servants  the army 
of persia and media  the nobles and 
princes of the provin ces being before 
him 4when he showed the riches of his 
glorious kingdom and the honour of 
his excellent majesty  many days  even 
a hundred and fourscore days  5and 
when these days were fulfilled  the 
king made a feast unto all the people 
that were presen t in shushan the 
castle  both great and small  seven 
days in the court of the garden of the 
kings palace  6there were hangings of 
white  fine cotton  and blue  bordered 
with cords of fine linen and purple  
upon silver rods and pillars of marble  
the couc hes were of gold and silver  
upon a pavement of green  and white  
and shell  and onyx marble  7and they 
gave them drink in vessels of gold 
the vessels being diverse one from 
another and royal wine in 
abundance  according to the bounty of 
the king  8and the  drinking was 
according to the law  none did compel  
for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house  that they should 
do according to every man s pleasure  
 9also vashti the queen made a feast 
for the women in the royal house 
which belonged  to king ahasuerus  
10on the seventh day  when the heart 
of the king was merry with wine  he 
commanded mehuman  bizzetha  
harbona  bigtha  and abagtha  zethar  
and carcas  the seven chamberlains 
that ministered in the presence of 
ahasuerus the king  11to bring vashti 
the queen before the king with the 
crown royal  to show the peoples and 
the princes her beauty  for she was fair 
to look on  12but the queen vashti 
refused to come at the king s 
commandment by the chamberlains  
therefore was the king very wroth  and 
his anger burned in him   
13then the king said to the wise men  
who knew the times for so was the 
kings manner toward all that knew 
law and judgment  14and the next unto 
him was carshena  shethar  admatha  
tarshish  meres  marsena  and 
memucan  the seven princes of persia 
and media  who saw the king s face  
and sat the first in the kingdom  
15what shall we do unto the queen 
vashti according to law  forasmuch as 
she hath not done the bidding of the 
king ahasuerus by the chamberlains  
 16and memucan answered before 
the king and the princes  vashti the 1 esther  
1188  
 queen hath not done wrong to the king 
only but also to all the princes  and to 
all the peoples  that are in all the 
provinces of the king ahasuerus  17for 
this deed of the queen will come 
abroad unto a ll women  to make their 
husbands contemptible in their eyes  
when it will be said  the king 
ahasuerus commanded vashti the 
queen to be brought in before him  but 
she came not  18and this day will the 
princesses of persia and media who 
have heard of the dee d of the queen 
say the like unto all the king s princes  
so will there arise enough contempt 
and wrath  19if it please the king  let 
there go forth a royal commandment 
from him  and let it be written among 
the laws of the persians and the 
medes  that it be  not altered  that 
vashti come no more before king 
ahasuerus  and that the king give her 
royal estate unto another that is better 
than she  20and when the king s decree 
which he shall make shall be published 
throughout all his kingdom  great 
though it be  all the wives will give to 
their husbands honour  both to great 
and small  21and the word pleased the 
king and the princes  and the king did 
according to the word of memucan  
22for he sent letters into all the king s 
provinces  into every province 
accordi ng to the writing thereof  and to 
every people after their language  that 
every man should bear rule in his own 
house  and speak according to the 
language of his people   
 after these things  when the 
wrath of king ahasuerus was 
assuaged  he remembered v ashti  and 
what she had done  and what was 
decreed against her  2then said the 
kings servants that ministered unto 
him let there be sought for the king 
young virgins fair to look on  3and let 
the king appoint officers in all the 
provinces of his kingdom  that they 
may gather together all the fair young 
virgins unto shushan the castle  to the 
house of the women  unto the custody 
of ahegai the king s chamberlain  
keeper of the women  and let their 
ointments be given them  4and let the 
maiden that pleaseth the king be queen 
instead of vashti  and the thing 
pleased the king  and he did so   
5there was a certain jew in shushan 
the castle  whose name was mordecai 
the son of jair the son of shimei the 
son of kish  a benjamite  6who had 
been carried away from je rusalem 
with the captives that had been carried 
away with jeconiah king of judah  
whom nebuchadnezzar the king of 
babylon had carried away  7and he 
brought up hadassah  that is  esther  
his uncle s daughter  for she had 
neither father nor mother  and the 
maiden was of beautiful form and fair 
to look on  and when her father and 
mother were dead  mordecai took her 
for his own daughter   
8so it came to pass  when the king s 
commandment and his decree was 
                                                      
a heb hege  2 esther  
1189  
 published  and when many maidens 
were gathered together unto shushan 
the castle  to the custody of hegai  that 
esther was taken into the king s house  
to the custody of hegai  keeper of the 
women  9and the maiden pleased him  
and she obtained kindness of him  and 
he speedily gave her her ointments  
with her por tions  and the seven 
maidens  who were meet to be given 
her out of the king s house  and he 
advanced her and her maidens to the 
best place in the house of the women  
10esther had not made known her 
people nor her kindred  for mordecai 
had charged her that she should not tell 
it 11and mordecai walked every day 
before the court of the women s house  
to know how esther did  and what 
would become of her   
12now when the turn of every 
maiden was come to go in to king 
ahasuerus  after that it had been done 
to he r according to the law for the 
women  twelve months for so were 
the days of their anointing 
accomplished  to wit  six months with 
oil of myrrh  and six month with sweet 
odours  and with other ointments of 
the women  13when then the maiden 
came unto the kin g whatsoever she 
desired was given her to go with her 
out of the house of the women unto the 
kings house  14in the evening she 
went  and on the morrow she returned 
into the second house of the women  to 
the custody of shaashgaz  the king s 
chamberlain  who kept the concubines  
she came in unto the king no more  except the king delighted in her  and 
she were called by name   
15now when the turn of esther  the 
daughter of abihail the uncle of 
mordecai  who had taken her for his 
daughter  was come to go in u nto the 
king she required nothing but what 
hegai the king s chamberlain  the 
keeper of the women  appointed  and 
esther obtained favour in the sight of 
all them that looked upon her  16so 
esther was taken unto king ahasuerus 
into his house royal in the te nth month  
which is the month tebeth  in the 
seventh year of his reign  17and the 
king loved esther above all the 
women  and she obtained grace and 
favour in his sight more than all the 
virgins  so that he set the royal crown 
upon her head  and made her qu een 
instead of vashti  18then the king 
made a great feast unto all his princes 
and his servants  even esther s feast  
and he made a release to the provinces  
and gave gifts  according to the bounty 
of the king   
19and when the virgins were 
gathered togethe r the second time  and 
mordecai sat in the king s gate 
20esther had not yet made known her 
kindred nor her people  as mordecai 
had charged her  for esther did the 
commandment of mordecai  like as 
when she was brought up with him  
21in those days  while mor decai sat in 
the king s gate  two of the king s 
chamberlains  bigthan and teresh  of 
those that kept the door  were wroth  
and sought to lay hands on the king esther  
1190  
 ahasuerus  22and the thing became 
known to mordecai  who told it unto 
esther the queen  and esthe r told the 
king thereof in mordecai s name  
23and when inquisition was made of 
the matter  and it was found to be so  
they were both hanged on a tree  and it 
was written in the book of the 
chronicles before the king   
 
after these things did king 
ahasuer us promote haman the 
son of hammedatha the agagite  and 
advanced him  and set his seat above 
all the princes that were with him  
2and all the king s servants  that were 
in the king s gate  bowed down  and 
prostrated themselves before haman  
for the king ha d so commanded 
concerning him  but mordecai bowed 
not down  nor prostrated himself 
before him  3then the king s servants  
that were in the king s gate  said unto 
mordecai  why transgressest thou the 
kings commandment  4now it came 
to pass  when they spo ke daily unto 
him and he hearkened not unto them  
that they told haman  to see whether 
mordecai s words would stand  for he 
had told them that he was a jew  5and 
when haman saw that mordecai 
bowed not down  nor prostrated 
himself before him  then was hama n 
full of wrath  6but it seemed 
contemptible in his eyes to lay hands 
on mordecai alone  for they had made 
known to him the people of mordecai  
wherefore haman sought to destroy all 
the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus  even the 
people of mordecai  7in the first 
month  which is the month nisan  in 
the twelfth year of king ahasuerus  
they cast pur  that is  the lot  before 
haman from day to day  and from 
month to month  to the twelfth month  
which is the month adar   
8and haman said u nto king 
ahasuerus  there is a certain people 
scattered abroad and dispersed among 
the peoples in all the provinces of thy 
kingdom  and their laws are diverse 
from those of every people  neither 
keep they the king s laws  therefore it 
profiteth not the ki ng to suffer them  
9if it please the king  let it be written 
that they be destroyed  and i will pay 
ten thousand talents of silver into the 
hands of those that have the charge of 
the king s business  to bring it into the 
kings treasuries  10and the king took 
his ring from his hand  and gave it 
unto haman the son of hammedatha 
the agagite  the jews enemy  11and 
the king said unto haman  the silver 
is given to thee  the people also  to do 
with them as it seemeth good to thee  
 12then were the king s scrib es 
called in the first month  on the 
thirteenth day thereof  and there was 
written  according to all that haman 
commanded  unto the king s satraps  
and to the governors that were over 
every province  and to the princes of 
every people  to every province 
according to the writing thereof  and to 
every people after their language  in 
the name of king ahasuerus was it 3 esther  
1191  
 written  and it was sealed with the 
kings ring  13and letters were sent by 
posts into all the king s provinces  to 
destroy  to slay  and to caus e to perish  
all jews  both young and old  little 
children and women  in one day  even 
upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth 
month  which is the month adar  and 
to take the spoil of them for a prey  
14the copy of the writing  to be given 
out for a decree in every province  was 
to be published unto all peoples  that 
they should be ready against that day  
15the posts went forth in haste by the 
kings commandment  and the decree 
was given out in shushan the castle  
and the king and haman sat down to 
drink  but the city of shushan was 
perplexed   
now when mordecai knew all 
that was done  mordecai rent his 
clothes  and put on sackcloth with 
ashes  and went out into the midst of 
the city  and cried with a loud and a 
bitter cry  2and he came even before 
the king s gate  for none might enter 
within the king s gate clothed with 
sackcloth  3and in every province  
whithersoever the king s 
commandment and his decree came  
there was great mourning among the 
jews  and fasting  and weeping  and 
wailing  and many lay in s ackcloth and 
ashes   
4and esther s maidens and her 
chamberlains came and told it her  and 
the queen was exceedingly pained  and 
she sent raiment to clothe mordecai  
and to take his sackcloth from off him  but he accepted it not  5then called 
esther for hat hach  one of the king s 
chamberlains  whom he had appointed 
to attend upon her  and charged him to 
go to mordecai  to know what this 
was and why it was  6so hathach 
went forth to mordecai unto the broad 
place of the city  which was before the 
kings gate  7and mordecai told him 
of all that had happened unto him  and 
the exact sum of the money that 
haman had promised to pay to the 
kings treasuries for the jews  to 
destroy them  8also he gave him the 
copy of the writing of the decree that 
was given out in s hushan to destroy 
them  to show it unto esther  and to 
declare it unto her  and to charge her 
that she should go in unto the king  to 
make supplication unto him  and to 
make request before him  for her 
people   
9and hathach came and told esther 
the words o f mordecai  10then esther 
spoke unto hathach  and gave him a 
message unto mordecai  11all the 
kings servants  and the people of the 
kings provinces  do know  that 
whosoever  whether man or woman  
shall come unto the king into the inner 
court  who is not  called  there is one 
law for him  that he be put to death  
except such to whom the king shall 
hold out the golden sceptre  that he 
may live  but i have not been called to 
come in unto the king these thirty 
days 12and they told to mordecai 
esther s words   4 esther  
1192  
 13then mordecai bade them to 
return answer unto esther  think not 
with thyself that thou shalt escape in 
the king s house  more than all the 
jews  14for if thou altogether holdest 
thy peace at this time  then will relief 
and deliverance arise to the je ws from 
another place  but thou and thy father s 
house will perish  and who knoweth 
whether thou art not come to royal 
estate for such a time as this  15then 
esther bade them return answer unto 
mordecai  16go gather together all 
the jews that are presen t in shushan  
and fast ye for me  and neither eat nor 
drink three days  night or day  i also 
and my maidens will fast in like 
manner  and so will i go in unto the 
king which is not according to the 
law and if i perish  i perish  17so 
mordecai went his w ay and did 
according to all that esther had 
commanded him   
now it came to pass on the third 
day that esther put on her royal 
apparel  and stood in the inner court of 
the king s house  over against the 
kings house  and the king sat upon his 
royal thro ne in the royal house  over 
against the entrance of the house  2and 
it was so  when the king saw esther 
the queen standing in the court  that 
she obtained favour in his sight  and 
the king held out to esther the golden 
sceptre that was in his hand  so esth er 
drew near  and touched the top of the 
sceptre  3then said the king unto her  
what wilt thou  queen esther  for 
whatever thy request  even to the half of the kingdom  it shall be given thee  
4and esther said  if it seem good unto 
the king  let the kin g and haman come 
this day unto the banquet that i have 
prepared for him  5then the king said  
cause haman to make haste  that it 
may be done as esther hath said  so 
the king and haman came to the 
banquet that esther had prepared  6and 
the king said unto  esther at the 
banquet of wine  whatever thy 
petition  it shall be granted thee  and 
whatever thy request  even to the half 
of the kingdom  it shall be performed  
7then answered esther  and said  my 
petition and my request is  8if i have 
found favour in  the sight of the king  
and if it please the king to grant my 
petition  and to perform my request 
let the king and haman come to the 
banquet that i shall prepare for them  
and i will do to morrow as the king 
hath said   
9then went haman forth that day 
joyful and glad of heart  but when 
haman saw mordecai in the king s 
gate that he stood not up  nor moved 
for him  haman was filled with wrath 
against mordecai  10nevertheless 
haman refrained himself  and went 
home  and he sent and fetched his 
friends and zer esh his wife  11and 
haman recounted unto them the glory 
of his riches  and the multitude of his 
children  and everything as to how the 
king had promoted him  and how he 
had advanced him above the princes 
and servants of the king  12haman said 
moreover  yea esther the queen did 5 esther  
1193  
 let no man come in with the king unto 
the banquet that she had prepared but 
myself  and to morrow also am i 
invited by her together with the king  
13yet all this availeth me nothing  so 
long as i see mordecai the jew sitting 
at the kings gate  14then said zeresh 
his wife and all his friends unto him  
let a gallows be made of fifty cubits 
high and in the morning speak thou 
unto the king that mordecai may be 
hanged thereon  then go thou in 
merrily with the king unto the 
banquet  and the thing pleased 
haman  and he caused the gallows to 
be made   
on that night could not the king 
sleep  and he commanded to bring 
the book of records of the chronicles  
and they were read before the king  
2and it was found written  that 
mordecai had t old of bigthana and 
teresh  two of the king s 
chamberlains  of those that kept the 
door who had sought to lay hands on 
the king ahasuerus  3and the king 
said what honour and dignity hath 
been done to mordecai for this  then 
said the king s servants tha t ministered 
unto him  there is nothing done for 
him 4and the king said  who is in 
the court now haman was come 
into the outer court of the king s 
house  to speak unto the king to hang 
mordecai on the gallows that he had 
prepared for him  5and the k ings 
servants said unto him  behold  
haman standeth in the court  and the 
king said  let him come in  6so haman came in  and the king said 
unto him  what shall be done unto the 
man whom the king delighteth to 
honour now haman said in his 
heart  whom would the king delight 
to honour besides myself 7and 
haman said unto the king  for the 
man whom the king delighteth to 
honour  8let royal apparel be brought 
which the king useth to wear  and the 
horse that the king rideth upon  and on 
whose head a cr own royal is set  9and 
let the apparel and the horse be 
delivered to the hand of one of the 
kings most noble princes  that they 
may array the man therewith whom 
the king delighteth to honour  and 
cause him to ride on horseback 
through the street of the ci ty and 
proclaim before him  thus shall it be 
done to the man whom the king 
delighteth to honour  10then the king 
said to haman  make haste  and take 
the apparel and the horse  as thou hast 
said and do even so to mordecai the 
jew that sitteth at the ki ngs gate  let 
nothing fail of all that thou hast 
spoken  11then took haman the 
apparel and the horse  and arrayed 
mordecai  and caused him to ride 
through the street of the city  and 
proclaimed before him  thus shall it 
be done unto the man whom the kin g 
delighteth to honour   
12and mordecai returned to the 
kings gate  but haman hasted to his 
house  mourning and having his head 
covered  13and haman recounted unto 
zeresh his wife and all his friends 6 esther  
1194  
 every thing that had befallen him  
then said his wise men and zeresh his 
wife unto him  if mordecai  before 
whom thou hast begun to fall  be of the 
seed of the jews  thou shalt not prevail 
against him  but shalt surely fall before 
him 14while they were yet talking 
with him  came the king s 
chamberlains  and hastened to bring 
haman unto the banquet that esther 
had prepared   
so the king and haman came to 
banquet with esther the queen  
2and the king said again unto esther 
on the second day at the banquet of 
wine  whatever thy petition  queen 
esther  it sha ll be granted thee  and 
whatever thy request  even to the half 
of the kingdom  it shall be performed  
3then esther the queen answered and 
said if i have found favour in thy 
sight  o king  and if it please the king  
let my life be given me at my petition  
and my people at my request  4for we 
are sold  i and my people  to be 
destroyed  to be slain  and to perish  
but if we had been sold for bondmen 
and bondwomen  i had held my peace  
for the adversary is not worthy that the 
king be endamaged   
5then spoke  the king ahasuerus and 
said unto esther the queen  who is 
he and where is he  that durst presume 
in his heart to do so  6and esther 
said an adversary and an enemy  
even this wicked haman  then 
haman was terrified before the king 
and the queen  7and the king arose in 
his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden  but 
haman remained to make request for 
his life to esther the queen  for he saw 
that there was evil determined against 
him by the king  8then the king 
returned out of the  palace garden into 
the place of the banquet of wine  and 
haman was fallen upon the couch 
whereon esther was  then said the 
king will he even force the queen 
before me in the house  as the word 
went out of the king s mouth  they 
covered haman s face  9then said 
harbonah  one of the chamberlains 
that were before the king  behold 
also the gallows fifty cubits high  
which haman hath made for 
mordecai  who spoke good for the 
king standeth in the house of haman  
and the king said  hang him 
thereon  10so they hanged haman on 
the gallows that he had prepared for 
mordecai  then was the king s wrath 
assuaged   
on that day did the king 
ahasuerus give the house of 
haman the jews enemy unto esther 
the queen  and mordecai came before 
the king  for esther had t old what he 
was unto her  2and the king took off 
his ring  which he had taken from 
haman  and gave it unto mordecai  
and esther set mordecai over the 
house of haman   
3and esther spoke yet again before 
the king  and fell down at his feet  and 
besought him with tears to put away 
the mischief of haman the agagite  
and his device that he had devised 7 
8 esther  
1195  
 against the jews  4then the king held 
out to esther the golden sceptre  so 
esther arose  and stood before the 
king 5and she said  if it please the 
king and if i  have found favour in his 
sight  and the thing seem right before 
the king  and i be pleasing in his eyes  
let it be written to reverse the letters 
devised by haman the son of 
hammedatha the agagite  which he 
wrote to destroy the jews that are in all 
the ki ngs provinces  6for how can i 
endure to see the evil that shall come 
unto my people  or how can i endure 
to see the destruction of my kindred   
7then the king ahasuerus said unto 
esther the queen and to mordecai the 
jew behold  i have given esther the 
house of haman  and him they have 
hanged upon the gallows  because he 
laid his hand upon the jews  8write ye 
also concerning the jews  as it liketh 
you in the king s name  and seal it 
with the king s ring  for the writing 
which is written in the king s name 
and sealed with the king s ring  may 
no man reverse  9then were the 
kings scribes called at that time  in the 
third month  which is the month sivan  
on the three and twentieth day thereof  
and it was written according to all that 
mordecai commanded c oncerning the 
jews  even to the satraps  and the 
governors and princes of the provinces 
which are from india unto ethiopia  a 
hundred twenty and seven provinces  
unto every province according to the 
writing thereof  and unto every people 
after their langua ge and to the jews according to their writing  and 
according to their language  10and 
they wrote in the name of king 
ahasuerus  and sealed it with the 
kings ring  and sent letters by posts on 
horseback  riding on swift steeds that 
were used in the king s service  bred 
of the stud  11that the king had granted 
the jews that were in every city to 
gather themselves together  and to 
stand for their life  to destroy  and to 
slay and to cause to perish  all the 
forces of the people and province that 
would assau lt them  their little ones 
and women  and to take the spoil of 
them for a prey  12upon one day in all 
the provinces of king ahasuerus  
namely  upon the thirteenth day of the 
twelfth month  which is the month 
adar  13the copy of the writing  to be 
given out  for a decree in every 
province  was to be published unto all 
the peoples  and that the jews should 
be ready against that day to avenge 
themselves on their enemies  14so the 
posts that rode upon swift steeds that 
were used in the king s service went 
out being hastened and pressed on by 
the king s commandment  and the 
decree was given out in shushan the 
castle   
15and mordecai went forth from the 
presence of the king in royal apparel of 
blue and white  and with a great crown 
of gold  and with a rob of fine linen 
and purple  and the city of shushan 
shouted and was glad  16the jews had 
light and gladness  and joy and 
honour  17and in every province  and esther  
1196  
 in every city  whithersoever the king s 
commandment and his decree came  
the jews had gladness and joy  a feast 
and a good day  and many from 
among the peoples of the land became 
jews  for the fear of the jews was 
fallen upon them   
now in the twelfth month  which 
is the month adar  on the 
thirteenth day of the same  when the 
kings commandment and his decree 
drew near to be put in execution  in the 
day that the enemies of the jews hoped 
to have rule over them  whereas it was 
turned to the contrary  that the jews 
had rule over them that hated them  
2the jews gathered themselves together 
in their cities througho ut all the 
provinces of the king ahasuerus  to lay 
hand on such as sought their hurt  and 
no man could withstand them  for the 
fear of them was fallen upon all the 
peoples  3and all the princes of the 
provinces  and the satraps  and the 
governors  and they  that did the king s 
business  helped the jews  because the 
fear of mordecai was fallen upon 
them  4for mordecai was great in the 
kings house  and his fame went forth 
throughout all the provinces  for the 
man mordecai waxed greater and 
greater  5and the j ews smote all their 
enemies with the stroke of the sword  
and with slaughter and destruction  
and did what they would unto them 
that hated them  6and in shushan the 
castle the jews slew and destroyed five 
hundred men  7and parshandatha  and 
dalphon  and as patha  8and poratha  and adalia  and aridatha  9and 
parmashta  and arisai  and aridai  and 
vaizatha  10the ten sons of haman the 
son of hammedatha  the jews enemy  
slew they  but on the spoil they laid 
not their hand   
11on that day the number of those 
that were slain in shushan the castle 
was brought before the king  12and the 
king said unto esther the queen  the 
jews have slain and destroyed five 
hundred men in shushan the castle  
and the ten sons of haman  what then 
have they done in the rest of the kin gs 
provinces  now whatever thy petition  
it shall be granted thee  and whatever 
thy request further  it shall be done  
13then said esther  if it please the 
king let it be granted to the jews that 
are in shushan to do to morrow also 
according unto this days decree  and 
let haman s ten sons be hanged upon 
the gallows  14and the king 
commanded it so to be done  and a 
decree was given out in shushan  and 
they hanged haman s ten sons  15and 
the jews that were in shushan 
gathered themselves together on the 
fourteenth day also of the month adar  
and slew three hundred men in 
shushan  but on the spoil they laid not 
their hand   
16and the other jews that were in 
the king s provinces gathered 
themselves together  and stood for 
their lives  and had rest from thei r 
enemies  and slew of them that hated 
them seventy and five thousand but 
on the spoil they laid not their hand 9 esther  
1197  
 17on the thirteenth day of the month 
adar  and on the fourteenth day of the 
same they rested  and made it a day of 
feasting and gladness  18but the jews 
that were in shushan assembled 
together on the thirteenth day thereof  
and on the fourteenth thereof  and on 
the fifteenth day of the same they 
rested  and made it a day of feasting 
and gladness  19therefore do the jews 
of the villages  that dwell  in the 
unwalled towns  make the fourteenth 
day of the month adar a day of 
gladness and feasting  and a good day  
and of sending portions one to another   
20and mordecai wrote these things  
and sent letters unto all the jews that 
were in all the provinces of the king 
ahasuerus  both nigh and far  21to 
enjoin them that they should keep the 
fourteenth day of the month adar  and 
the fifteenth day of the same  yearly  
22the days wherein the jews had rest 
from their enemies  and the month 
which was turned unto t hem from 
sorrow to gladness  and from 
mourning into a good day  that they 
should make them days of feasting and 
gladness  and of sending portions one 
to another  and gifts to the poor  23and 
the jews took upon them to do as they 
had begun  and as mordecai had 
written unto them  24because haman 
the son of hammedatha  the agagite  
the enemy of all the jews  had devised 
against the jews to destroy them  and 
had cast pur  that is  the lot  to 
discomfit them  and to destroy them  25but when ashe came before the king 
he commanded by letters that his 
wicked device  which he had devised 
against the jews  should return upon 
his own head  and that he and his sons 
should be hanged on the gallows  
26wherefore they called these days 
purim  after the name of pur  
therefo re because of all the words of 
this letter  and of that which they had 
seen concerning this matter  and that 
which had come unto them  27the jews 
ordained  and took upon them  and 
upon their seed  and upon all such as 
joined themselves unto them  so as it 
should not fail  that they would keep 
these two days according to the 
writing thereof  and according to the 
appointed time thereof  every year  
28and that these days should be 
remembered and kept throughout 
every generation  every family  every 
province  and every city  and that these 
days of purim should not fail from 
among the jews  nor the memorial of 
them perish from their seed   
29then esther the queen  the 
daughter of abihail  and mordecai the 
jew wrote down all the acts of power  
to confirm this sec ond letter of purim  
30and he sent letters unto all the jews  
to the hundred twenty and seven 
provinces of the kingdom of 
ahasuerus  with words of peace and 
truth  31to confirm these days of purim 
in their appointed times  according as 
mordecai the jew and  esther the 
                                                      
a that is esther  esther  
1198  
 queen had enjoined them  and as they 
had ordained for themselves and for 
their seed  the matters of the fastings 
and their cry  32and the commandment 
of esther confirmed these matters of 
purim  and it was written in the book   
 
and the king ahasuerus laid a 
tribute upon the land  and 
upon the isles of the sea  2and all the 
acts of his power and of his might  and the full account of the greatness of 
mordecai  how the king advanced him  
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of media and 
persia  3for mordecai the jew was 
next unto king ahasuerus  and great 
among the jews  and accepted of the 
multitude of his brethren  seeking the 
good of his people and speaking peace 
to all his seed

1199  
   
daniel  
 
in the  third year of the reign of 
jehoiakim king of judah came 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto 
jerusalem  and besieged it  2and the 
lord gave jehoiakim king of judah 
into his hand  with part of the vessels 
of the house of god  and he c arried 
them into the land of shinar to the 
house of his god  and the vessels he 
brought into the treasure house of his 
god 3and the king spoke unto 
ashpenaz his chief officer  that he 
should bring in certain of the children 
of israel  and of the seed roya l and of 
the nobles  4youths in whom was no 
blemish  but fair to look on  and skilful 
in all wisdom  and skilful in 
knowledge  and discerning in thought  
and such as had ability to stand in the 
kings palace  and that he should teach 
them the learning and  the tongue of the 
chaldeans  5and the king appointed 
for them a daily portion of the king s 
food and of the wine which he drank  
and that they should be nourished 
three years  that at the end thereof they 
might stand before the king  6now 
among these wer e of the children of 
judah  daniel  hananiah  mishael  and 
azariah  7and the chief of the officers 
gave names unto them  unto daniel he 
gave the name of belteshazzar  and to 
hananiah  of shadrach  and to 
mishael  of meshach  and to azariah  
of abed nego   8but daniel purposed in his heart 
that he would not defile himself with 
the king s food  nor with the wine 
which he drank  therefore he requested 
of the chief of the officers that he 
might not defile himself  9and god 
granted daniel mercy and compassion 
in the sight of the chief of the officers  
10and the chief of the officers said 
unto daniel  i fear my lord the king  
who hath appointed your food and 
your drink  for why should he see your 
faces sad in comparison with the 
youths that are of your own age  so 
would ye endanger my head with the 
king 11then said daniel to the 
steward  whom the chief of the officers 
had appointed over daniel  hananiah  
mishael  and azariah  12try thy 
servants  i beseech thee  ten days  and 
let them give us pulse to eat  and water 
to drink  13then let our countenances 
be looked upon before thee  and the 
countenance of the youths that eat of 
the king s food  and as thou seest  deal 
with thy servants  14so he hearkened 
unto them in this matter  and tried 
them ten days  15and at  the end of ten 
days their countenances appeared 
fairer  and they were fatter in flesh  
than all the youths that did eat of the 
kings food  16so the steward took 
away their food  and the wine that they 
should drink  and gave them pulse  
 17now as for thes e four youths  god 1 daniel  
1200  
 gave them knowledge and skill in all 
learning and wisdom  and daniel had 
understanding in all visions and 
dreams  18and at the end of the days 
which the king had appointed for 
bringing them in  the chief of the 
officers brought them in b efore 
nebuchadnezzar  19and the king spoke 
with them  and among them all was 
found none like daniel  hananiah  
mishael  and azariah  therefore stood 
they before the king  20and in all 
matters of wisdom and understanding  
that the king inquired of them  he 
found them ten times better than all the 
magicians and enchanters that were in 
all his realm  21and daniel continued 
even unto the first year of king cyrus   
and in the second year of the 
reign of nebuchadnezzar  
nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams  and 
his spi rit was troubled  and his sleep 
broke from him  2then the king 
commanded to call the magicians  and 
the enchanters  and the sorcerers  and 
the chaldeans  to tell the king his 
dreams  so they came and stood before 
the king  3and the king said unto them  
i have dreamed a dream  and my 
spirit is troubled to know the dream  
4then spoke the chaldeans to the king 
in aramaic  o king  live for ever  tell 
thy servants the dream  and we will 
declare the interpretation  5the king 
answered and said to the chaldeans  
the thing is certain with me  if ye 
make not known unto me the dream 
and the interpretation thereof  ye shall 
be cut in pieces  and your houses shall be made a dunghill  6but if ye declare 
the dream and the interpretation 
thereof  ye shall receive of me  gifts 
and rewards and great honour  only 
declare unto me the dream and the 
interpretation thereof  7they answered 
the second time and said  let the king 
tell his servants the dream  and we will 
declare the interpretation  8the king 
answered and said  i know of a truth 
that ye would gain time  inasmuch as 
ye see the thing is certain with me  
9that if ye make not known unto me 
the dream  there is but one law for 
you and ye have agreed together to 
speak before me lying and corrupt 
words  till the time b e changed  only 
tell me the dream  and i shall know 
that ye can declare unto me the 
interpretation thereof  10the 
chaldeans answered before the king  
and said  there is not a man upon the 
earth that can declare the king s 
matter  forasmuch as no great an d 
powerful king hath asked such a thing 
of any magician  or enchanter  or 
chaldean  11and it is a hard thing that 
the king asketh  and there is none other 
that can declare it before the king  
except the gods  whose dwelling is not 
with flesh  12for this c ause the king 
was angry and very furious  and 
commanded to destroy all the wise 
men of babylon  13so the decree went 
forth  and the wise men were to be 
slain  and they sought daniel and his 
companions to be slain   
14then daniel returned answer with 
counse l and discretion to arioch the 2 daniel  
1201  
 captain of the king s guard  who was 
gone forth to slay the wise men of 
babylon  15he answered and said to 
arioch the king s captain  wherefore 
is the decree so peremptory from the 
king then arioch made the thing 
known to daniel  16then daniel went 
in and desired of the king that he 
would give him time  that he might 
declare unto the king the 
interpretation   
17then daniel went to his house  
and made the thing known to 
hananiah  mishael  and azariah  his 
companions  18that they might ask 
mercy of the god of heaven 
concerning this secret  that daniel and 
his companions should not perish with 
the rest of the wise men of babylon  
19then was the secret revealed unto 
daniel in a vision of the night  then 
daniel blessed the god o f heaven  
20daniel spoke and said   
blessed be the name of god  
from everlasting even unto 
everlasting   
for wisdom and might are his   
21and he changeth the times and the 
seasons   
he removeth kings  and setteth up 
kings   
he giveth wisdom unto the wise   
and knowledge to them that know 
understanding   
22he revealeth the deep and secret 
things   
he knoweth what is in the darkness   
and the light dwelleth with him   
23i thank thee  and praise thee   o thou god of my fathers  w 
who ha st given me wisdom and 
might  
and hast now made known unto me 
what we desired of thee   
for thou hast made known unto us 
the king s matter   
24therefore daniel went in unto 
arioch  whom the king had appointed 
to destroy the wise men of babylon  he 
went and said thus unto him  destroy 
not the wise men of babylon  bring me 
in before the king  and i will declare 
unto the king the interpretation   
25then arioch brought in daniel 
before the king in haste  and said thus 
unto him  i have found a man of the 
children of the captivity o f judah  that 
will make known unto the king the 
interpretation  26the king spoke and 
said to daniel  whose name was 
belteshazzar  art thou able to make 
known unto me the dream which i 
have seen  and the interpretation 
thereof  27daniel answered before t he 
king and said  the secret which the 
king hath asked can neither wise men  
enchanters  magicians  nor astrologers  
declare unto the king  28but there is a 
god in heaven that revealeth secrets  
and he hath made known to the king 
nebuchadnezzar what shal l be in the 
end of days  thy dream  and the 
visions of thy head upon thy bed  are 
these  29as for thee  o king  thy 
thoughts came into thy mind  upon 
thy bed  what should come to pass 
hereafter  and he that revealeth secrets 
hath made known to thee what s hall daniel  
1202  
 come to pass  30but as for me  this 
secret is not revealed to me for any 
wisdom that i have more than any 
living  but to the intent that the 
interpretation may be made known to 
the king  and that thou mayest know 
the thoughts of thy heart   
31thou  o king sawest  and behold 
a great image  this image  which was 
mighty  and whose brightness was 
surpassing  stood before thee  and the 
appearance thereof was terrible  32as 
for that image  its head was of fine 
gold its breast and its arms of silver  
its be lly and its thighs of brass  33its 
legs of iron  its feet part of iron and 
part of clay  34thou sawest till that a 
stone was cut out without hands  
which smote the image upon its feet 
that were of iron and clay  and broke 
them to pieces  35then was the iro n 
the clay  the brass  the silver  and the 
gold broken in pieces together  and 
became like the chaff of the summer 
threshing floors  and the wind carried 
them away  so that no place was found 
for them  and the stone that smote the 
image became a great mo untain  and 
filled the whole earth  36this is the 
dream  and we will tell the 
interpretation thereof before the king   
37thou  o king  king of kings  unto 
whom the god of heaven hath given 
the kingdom  the power  and the 
strength  and the glory  38and 
wher esoever the children of men  the 
beasts of the field  and the fowls of the 
heaven dwell  hath he given them into 
thy hand  and hath made thee to rule over them all  thou art the head of 
gold 39and after thee shall arise 
another kingdom inferior to thee  and 
another third kingdom of brass  which 
shall bear rule over all the earth  40and 
the fourth kingdom shall be strong as 
iron forasmuch as iron breaketh in 
pieces and beateth down all things  
and as iron that crusheth all these  
shall it break in pieces a nd crush  
41and whereas thou sawest the feet 
and toes  part of potters clay and part 
of iron  it shall be a divided kingdom  
but there shall be in it of the firmness 
of the iron  forasmuch as thou sawest 
the iron mixed with miry clay  42and 
as the toes of  the feet were part of iron  
and part of clay  so part of the 
kingdom shall be strong  and part 
thereof broken  43and whereas thou 
sawest the iron mixed with miry clay  
they shall mingle themselves by the 
seed of men  but they shall not cleave 
one to anoth er even as iron doth not 
mingle with clay  44and in the days of 
those kings shall the god of heaven set 
up a kingdom  which shall never be 
destroyed  nor shall the kingdom be 
left to another people  it shall break in 
pieces and consume all these 
kingdoms  but it shall stand for ever  
45forasmuch as thou sawest that a 
stone was cut out of the mountain 
without hands  and that it broke in 
pieces the iron  the brass  the clay  the 
silver  and the gold  the great god hath 
made known to the king what shall 
come to pass hereafter  and the dream 
is certain  and the interpretation daniel  
1203  
 thereof sure  46then the king 
nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face  
and worshipped daniel  and 
commanded that they should offer an 
offering and sweet odours unto him  
47the king spoke unto d aniel  and 
said of a truth it is  that your god is 
the god of gods  and the lord of 
kings  and a revealer of secrets  seeing 
thou hast been able to reveal this 
secret  48then the king made daniel 
great  and gave him many great gifts  
and made him to rul e over the whole 
province of babylon  and to be chief 
prefect over all the wise men of 
babylon  49and daniel requested of 
the king  and he appointed shadrach  
meshach  and abed nego  over the 
affairs of the province of babylon  but 
daniel was in the gate o f the king   
 
nebuchadnezzar the king made 
an image of gold  whose height 
was threescore cubits  and the breadth 
thereof six cubits  he set it up in the 
plain of dura  in the province of 
babylon  2then nebuchadnezzar the 
king sent to gather together the satraps  
the prefects  and the governors  the 
judges  the treasurers  the counsellors  
the sheriffs  and all the rulers of the 
provinces  to come to the dedication of 
the image which nebuchadnezzar the 
king had set up  3then the satraps  the 
prefects  and the governors  the judges  
the treasurers  the counsellors  the 
sheriffs  and all the rulers of the 
provinces  were gathered together unto 
the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up  
and they stood before the image that 
nebuchadnez zar had set up  4and the 
herald cried aloud  to you it is 
commanded  o peoples  nations  and 
languages  5that at what time ye hear 
the sound of the horn  pipe harp 
trigon  psaltery  bagpipe  and all kinds 
of music  ye fall down and worship the 
golden im age that nebuchadnezzar the 
king hath set up  6and whoso falleth 
not down and worshippeth shall the 
same hour be cast into the midst of a 
burning fiery furnace  7therefore at 
that time  when all the peoples heard 
the sound of the horn  pipe harp 
trigon  psaltery  and all kinds of music  
all the peoples  the nations  and the 
languages  fell down and worshipped 
the golden image that nebuchadnezzar 
the king had set up   
8wherefore at that time certain 
chaldeans came near  and brought 
accusation against the jews  9they 
spoke and said to nebuchadnezzar the 
king o king  live for ever  10thou  o 
king hast made a decree  that every 
man that shall hear the sound of the 
horn pipe harp trigon  psaltery  and 
bagpipe  and all kinds of music  shall 
fall down and worship the golden 
image  11and whoso falleth not down 
and worshippeth shall be cast into the 
midst of a burning fiery furnace  
12there are certain jews whom thou 
hast appointed over the affairs of the 
province of babylon  shadrach  
meshach  and abed nego  these men  
o king  have not regarded thee  they 3 daniel  
1204  
 serve not thy gods  nor worship the 
golden image which thou hast set up   
13then nebuchadnezzar in his rage 
and fury commanded to bring 
shadrach  meshach  and abed nego  
then were these men brought before 
the king  14nebuchadnezzar spoke and 
said unto them  is it true  o shadrach  
meshach  and abed nego  that ye 
serve not my gods  nor worship the 
golden image which i have set up  
15now if ye be ready that at what time 
ye hear the sound of the horn  pipe 
harp trigon  psaltery  and bagpipe  and 
all kinds of music  ye fall down and 
worship the image which i have made 
 well but if ye worship not  ye shall 
be cast the same hour into the midst of 
a burning fiery furnace  and who is the 
god that shall deliver y ou out of my 
hands  16shadrach  meshach  and 
abed nego  answered and said to the 
king o nebuchadnezzar  we have no 
need to answer thee in this matter  17if 
our god whom we serve is able to 
deliver us  he will deliver us from the 
burning fiery furnace  and out of thy 
hand  o king  18but if not  be it known 
unto thee  o king  that we will not 
serve thy gods  nor worship the golden 
image which thou hast set up   
19then was nebuchadnezzar filled 
with fury  and the form of his visage 
was changed  against sha drach  
meshach  and abed nego  he spoke  
and commanded that they should heat 
the furnace seven times more than it 
was wont to be heated  20and he 
commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach  
meshach  and abed nego  and to cast 
them into the burning fiery furnace  
21then these men were bound in their 
cloaks  their tunics  and their robes  
and their other garments  and were cast 
into the midst of the burning fiery 
furnace  22therefore because the 
kings commandment was peremptory  
and the furnace exceeding hot  the 
flame of the fire slew those men that 
took up shadrach  meshach  and 
abed nego  23and these three men  
shadrach  meshach  and abed nego  
fell down bound into the midst of the 
burning fiery furnace   
24then nebuchadnezzar the king 
was alarmed  and rose up in haste  he 
spoke and said unto his ministers  did 
not we cast three men bound into the 
midst of the fire  they answered and 
said unto the king  true  o king  
25he answered and said  lo i see four 
men loose  walking in the midst of the 
fire and they have no hurt  and the 
appearance of the fourth is like a son 
of the gods   
26then nebuchadnezzar came near 
to the mouth of the burning fiery 
furnace  he spoke and said  shadrach  
meshach  and abed nego  ye servants 
of god most high  come forth  and 
come hither  then shadrach  
meshach  and abed nego  came forth 
out of the midst of the fire  27and the 
satraps  the prefects  and the 
governors  and the king s ministers  
being gathered together  saw these 
men that the fire had  no power upon daniel  
1205  
 their bodies  nor was the hair of their 
head singed  neither were their cloaks 
changed  nor had the smell of fire 
passed on them  28nebuchadnezzar 
spoke and said  blessed be the god of 
shadrach  meshach  and abed nego  
who hath sent his ang el and delivered 
his servants that trusted in him  and 
have changed the king s word  and 
have yielded their bodies  that they 
might not serve nor worship any god  
except their own god  29therefore i 
make a decree  that every people  
nation  and language  which speak any 
thing amiss against the god of 
shadrach  meshach  and abed nego  
shall be cut in pieces  and their houses 
shall be made a dunghill  because 
there is no other god that is able to 
deliver after this sort  30then the king 
promoted shadrach  meshach  and 
abed nego  in the province of 
babylon   
 
31nebuchadnezzar the king  unto all 
peoples  nations  and languages  that 
dwell in all the earth  peace be 
multiplied unto you   32it hath seemed 
good unto me to declare the signs and 
wonders that god m ost high hath 
wrought toward me    
33how great are his signs   
and how mighty are his wonders   
his kingdom is an everlasting 
kingdom   
and his dominion is from 
generation to generation    
i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in 
my house  and flourishing in my palace   2i saw a dream which made 
me afraid  and imaginings upon my 
bed and the visions of my head 
affrighted me   3therefore made i a 
decree to bring in all the wise men of 
babylon before me  that they might 
make known unto me the 
interpretation of the dr eam  4then 
came in the magicians  the enchanters  
the chaldeans  and the astrologers  and 
i told the dream before them  but they 
did not make known unto me the 
interpretation thereof   5but at the last 
daniel came in before me  whose 
name was belteshazzar  according to 
the name of my god  and in whom is 
the spirit of the holy gods  and i told 
the dream before him  6o 
belteshazzar  master of the magicians  
because i know that the spirit of the 
holy gods is in thee  and no secret 
causeth thee trouble  tell m e the 
visions of my dream that i have seen  
and the interpretation thereof  7thus 
were the visions of my head upon my 
bed i saw   
and behold a tree in the midst of the 
earth   
and the height thereof was great  
 8the tree grew  and was strong   
and the hei ght thereof reached unto 
heaven   
and the sight thereof to the end of 
all the earth   
9the leaves thereof were fair  and 
the fruit thereof much   
and in it was food for all   
the beasts of the field had shadow 
under it   4 daniel  
1206  
 and the fowls of the heaven dwelt 
in the branches thereof   
and all flesh was fed of it   
10i saw in the visions of my head upon 
my bed  and behold  a watcher and a 
holy one came down from heaven  
11he cried aloud  and said thus   
hew down the tree  and cut off its 
branches   
shake off its  leaves  and scatter its 
fruit  
let the beasts get away from under 
it  
and the fowls from its branches   
12nevertheless leave the stump of its 
roots in the earth   
even in a band of iron and brass  in 
the tender grass of the field   
and let it be wet wit h the dew of 
heaven   
and let his portion be with the 
beasts in the grass of the earth   
13let his heart be changed from 
mans  
and let a beast s heart be given unto 
him  
and let seven times pass over him   
14the matter is by the decree of the 
watchers   
and the sentence by the word of the 
holy ones   
to the intent that the living may 
know  
that the most high ruleth in the 
kingdom of men   
and giveth it to whomsoever he 
will  
and setteth up over it the lowest of 
men  15this dream i king nebuchadnezzar 
have seen  and thou  o belteshazzar  
declare the interpretation  forasmuch 
as all the wise men of my kingdom are 
not able to make known unto me the 
interpretation  but thou art able  for the 
spirit of the holy gods is in thee   
 
16then daniel  whose name w as 
belteshazzar  was appalled for a while  
and his thoughts affrighted him  the 
king spoke and said  belteshazzar  let 
not the dream  or the interpretation  
affright thee  belteshazzar answered 
and said  my lord  the dream be to 
them that hate thee  and the 
interpretation thereof to thine 
adversaries  17the tree that thou 
sawest  which grew  and was strong  
whose height reached unto the heaven  
and the sight thereof to all the earth  
18whose leaves were fair  and the fruit 
thereof much  and in it was foo d for 
all under which the beasts of the field 
dwelt  and upon whose branches the 
fowls of the heaven had their 
habitation  19it is thou  o king  that art 
grown and become strong  for thy 
greatness is grown  and reacheth unto 
heaven  and thy dominion to th e end of 
the earth  20and whereas the king saw 
a watcher and a holy one coming down 
from heaven  and saying  hew down 
the tree  and destroy it  nevertheless 
leave the stump of the roots thereof in 
the earth  even in a band of iron and 
brass  in the tender grass of the field  
and let it be wet with the dew of 
heaven  and let his portion be with the daniel  
1207  
 beasts of the field  till seven times pass 
over him 21this is the interpretation  
o king  and it is the decree of the most 
high  which is come upon my lord the 
king 22that thou shalt be driven from 
men and thy dwelling shall be with 
the beasts of the field  and thou shalt 
be made to eat grass as oxen  and shalt 
be wet with the dew of heaven  and 
seven times shall pass over thee  till 
thou know that the most high ruleth in 
the kingdom of men  and giveth it to 
whomsoever he will  23and whereas it 
was commanded to leave the stump of 
the roots of the tree  thy kingdom shall 
be sure unto thee  after that thou shalt 
have known that the heavens do rule  
24wherefore  o king let my counsel be 
acceptable unto thee  and break off thy 
sins by almsgiving  and thine iniquities 
by showing mercy to the poor  if there 
may be a lengthening of thy 
prosperity   
25all this came upon the king 
nebuchadnezzar  26at the end of 
twelve mon ths he was walking upon 
the royal palace of babylon  27the 
king spoke  and said  is not this great 
babylon  which i have built for a royal 
dwelling place  by the might of my 
power and for the glory of my 
majesty  28while the word was in the 
kings mouth  there fell a voice from 
heaven  o king nebuchadnezzar  to 
thee it is spoken  the kingdom is 
departed from thee  29and thou shalt 
be driven from men  and thy dwelling 
shall be with the beasts of the field  
thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen  and seve n times shall pass over 
thee until thou know that the most 
high ruleth in the kingdom of men  
and giveth it to whomsoever he will  
30the same hour was the thing fulfilled 
upon nebuchadnezzar  and he was 
driven from men  and did eat grass as 
oxen  and his  body was wet with the 
dew of heaven  till his hair was grown 
like eagles feathers  and his nails like 
birds claws   
 
31and at the end of the days i 
nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes 
unto heaven  and mine understanding 
returned unto me  and i blessed the  
most high  and i praised and honoured 
him that liveth for ever   
for his dominion is an everlasting 
dominion   
and his kingdom from generation 
to generation   
32and all the inhabitants of the earth 
are reputed as nothing   
and he doeth according to his wi ll 
in the host of heaven   
and among the inhabitants of the 
earth   
and none can stay his hand   
or say unto him  what doest thou   
33at the same time mine understanding 
returned unto me  and for the glory of 
my kingdom  my majesty and my 
splendour returne d unto me  and my 
ministers and my lords sought unto 
me and i was established in my 
kingdom  and surpassing greatness 
was added unto me  34now i 
nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and daniel  
1208  
 honour the king of heaven  for all his 
works are truth  and his ways justi ce 
and those that walk in pride he is able 
to abase   
 
belshazzar the king made a 
great feast to a thousand of his 
lords  and drank wine before the 
thousand  2belshazzar  while he tasted 
the wine  commanded to bring the 
golden and silver vessels which 
nebuchadnezzar his father had taken 
out of the temple which was in 
jerusalem  that the king and his lords  
his consorts and his concubines  might 
drink therein  3then they brought the 
golden vessels that were taken out of 
the temple of the house of god whi ch 
was at jerusalem  and the king  and his 
lords  his consorts and his concubines  
drank in them  4they drank wine  and 
praised the gods of gold  and of silver  
of brass  of iron  of wood  and of 
stone  5in the same hour came forth 
fingers of a man s hand  and wrote 
over against the candlestick upon the 
plaster of the wall of the king s palace  
and the king saw the palm of the hand 
that wrote  6then the king s 
countenance was changed in him  and 
his thoughts affrighted him  and the 
joints of his loins were loosed  and his 
knees smote one against another  7the 
king cried aloud to bring in the 
enchanters  the chaldeans  and the 
astrologers  the king spoke and said to 
the wise men of babylon  whosoever 
shall read this writing  and declare 
unto me the interpret ation thereof  shall be clothed with purple  and have 
a chain of gold about his neck  and 
shall rule as one of three in the 
kingdom   
8then came in all the king s wise 
men but they could not read the 
writing  nor make known to the king 
the interpretation  9then was king 
belshazzar greatly affrighted  and his 
countenance was changed in him  and 
his lords were perplexed  10now the 
queen by reason of the words of the 
king and his lords came into the 
banquet house  the queen spoke and 
said o king  live for ever let not thy 
thoughts affright thee  nor let thy 
countenance be changed  11there is a 
man in thy kingdom  in whom is the 
spirit of the holy gods  and in the days 
of thy father light and understanding 
and wisdom  like the wisdom of the 
gods  was found in him  and the king 
nebuchadnezzar thy father  the king  i 
say thy father  made him master of the 
magicians  enchanters  chaldeans  and 
astrologers  12forasmuch as a 
surpassing spirit  and knowledge  and 
understanding  interpreting of dreams  
and declari ng of riddles  and loosing of 
knots  were found in the same daniel  
whom the king named belteshazzar  
now let daniel be called  and he will 
declare the interpretation   
13then was daniel brought in before 
the king  the king spoke and said unto 
daniel  art thou daniel  who is of the 
children of the captivity of judah  
whom the king my father brought out 
of judah  14i have heard of thee  that 5 daniel  
1209  
 the spirit of the gods is in thee  and 
that light and understanding and 
surpassing wisdom is found in thee  
15and no w the wise men  the 
enchanters  have been brought in 
before me  that they should read this 
writing  and make known unto me the 
interpretation thereof  but they could 
not declare the interpretation of the 
thing  16but i have heard of thee  that 
thou canst g ive interpretations  and 
loose knots  now if thou canst read the 
writing  and make known to me the 
interpretation thereof  thou shalt be 
clothed with purple  and have a chain 
of gold about thy neck  and shalt rule 
as one of three in the kingdom   
17then d aniel answered and said 
before the king  let thy gifts be to 
thyself  and give thy rewards to 
another  nevertheless i will read the 
writing unto the king  and make 
known to him the interpretation  18o 
thou king  god most high gave 
nebuchadnezzar thy fathe r the 
kingdom  and greatness  and glory  
and majesty  19and because of the 
greatness that he gave him  all the 
peoples  nations  and languages 
trembled and feared before him  whom 
he would he slew  and whom he would 
he kept alive  and whom he would he 
raised up  and whom he would he put 
down  20but when his heart was lifted 
up and his spirit was hardened that he 
dealt proudly  he was deposed from his 
kingly throne  and his glory was taken 
from him  21and he was driven from 
the sons of men  and his heart wa s made like the beasts  and his dwelling 
was with the wild asses  he was fed 
with grass like oxen  and his body was 
wet with the dew of heaven  until he 
knew that god most high ruleth in the 
kingdom of men  and that he setteth 
up over it whomsoever he will  22and 
thou his son  o belshazzar  hast not 
humbled thy heart  though thou 
knewest all this  23but hast lifted up 
thyself against the lord of heaven  and 
they have brought the vessels of his 
house before thee  and thou and thy 
lords  thy consorts and thy concubines  
have drunk wine in them  and thou 
hast praised the gods of silver  and 
gold of brass  iron wood  and stone  
which see not  nor hear  nor know  and 
the god in whose hand thy breath is  
and whose are all thy ways  hast thou 
not glorified  24then was the palm of 
the hand sent from before him  and 
this writing was inscribed  25and this 
is the writing that was inscribed  
mene mene  tekel upharsin  
26this is the interpretation of the thing  
mene  god hath numbered thy 
kingdom  and brought it to an e nd 
27tekel  thou art weighed in the 
balances  and art found wanting  
28peres  thy kingdom is divided  and 
given to the medes and persians  
29then commanded belshazzar  and 
they clothed daniel with purple  and 
put a chain of gold about his neck  and 
made proclamation concerning him  
that he should rule as one of three in 
the kingdom  30in that night belshazzar 
the chaldean king was slain   daniel  
1210  
 and darius the mede received the 
kingdom  being about threescore 
and two years old  2it pleased darius to 
set over t he kingdom a hundred and 
twenty satraps  who should be 
throughout the whole kingdom  3and 
over them three presidents  of whom 
daniel was one  that these satraps 
might give account unto them  and that 
the king should have no damage   
4then this daniel disti nguished 
himself above the presidents and the 
satraps  because a surpassing spirit 
was in him  and the king thought to set 
him over the whole realm    
5then the presidents and the satraps 
sought to find occasion against daniel 
as touching the kingdom  but they 
could find no occasion nor fault  
forasmuch as he was faithful  neither 
was there any error or fault found in 
him  6then said these men  we shall 
not find any occasion against this 
daniel  except we find it against him 
in the matter of the law of hi s god   
7then these presidents and satraps 
came tumultuously to the king  and 
said thus unto him  king darius  live 
for ever   8all the presidents of the 
kingdom  the prefects and the satraps  
the ministers and the governors  have 
consulted together that  the king should 
establish a statute  and make a strong 
interdict  that whosoever shall ask a 
petition of any god or man for thirty 
days save of thee  o king  he shall be 
cast into the den of lions   9now  o 
king establish the interdict  and sign 
the wri ting that it be not changed  according to the law of the medes and 
persians  which altereth not   
10wherefore king darius signed the 
writing and the interdict   
11and when daniel knew that the 
writing was signed  he went into his 
house now his windows we re open 
in his upper chamber toward 
jerusalem and he kneeled upon his 
knees three times a day  and prayed  
and gave thanks before his god  as he 
did aforetime  12then these men came 
tumultuously  and found daniel 
making petition and supplication 
before his  god 13then they came near  
and spoke before the king concerning 
the king s interdict  hast thou not 
signed an interdict  that every man that 
shall make petition unto any god or 
man within thirty days  save of thee  o 
king shall be cast into the den of 
lions  the king answered and said  
the thing is true  according to the law 
of the medes and persians  which 
altereth not  14then answered they 
and said before the king  that daniel  
who is of the children of the captivity 
of judah  regardeth not thee  o king  
nor the interdict that thou hast signed  
but maketh his petition three times a 
day  15then the king  when he heard 
these words  was sore displeased  and 
set his heart on daniel to deliver him  
and he laboured till the going down of 
the sun to del iver him  16then these 
men came tumultuously unto the king  
and said unto the king  know  o king  
that it is a law of the medes and 
persians  that no interdict nor statute 6 daniel  
1211  
 which the king establisheth may be 
changed  17then the king 
commanded  and they br ought daniel  
and cast him into the den of lions  
now the king spoke and said unto 
daniel  thy god whom thou servest 
continually  he will deliver thee  
18and a stone was brought  and laid 
upon the mouth of the den  and the 
king sealed it with his own sig net and 
with the signet of his lords  that 
nothing might be changed concerning 
daniel   
19then the king went to his palace  
and passed the night fasting  neither 
were diversions brought before him  
and his sleep fled from him   20then 
the king arose very early in the 
morning  and went in haste unto the 
den of lions  21and when he came near 
unto the den to daniel  he cried with a 
pained voice  the king spoke and said 
to daniel  o daniel  servant of the 
living god  is thy god  whom thou 
servest continually  able to deliver thee 
from the lions  22then said daniel 
unto the king  o king  live for ever   
23my god hath sent his angel  and 
hath shut the lions mouths  and they 
have not hurt me  forasmuch as before 
him innocency was found in me  and 
also before th ee o king  have i done 
no hurt  24then was the king 
exceeding glad  and commanded that 
they should take daniel up out of the 
den so daniel was taken up out of the 
den and no manner of hurt was found 
upon him  because he had trusted in 
his god  25and th e king commanded  and they brought those men that had 
accused daniel  and they cast them 
into the den of lions  them  their 
children  and their wives  and they had 
not come to the bottom of the den  
when the lions had the mastery of 
them  and broke all the ir bones in 
pieces   
26then king darius wrote unto all 
the peoples  nations  and languages  
that dwell in all the earth  peace be 
multiplied unto you  27i make a decree  
that in all the dominion of my 
kingdom men tremble and fear before 
the god of daniel   
for he is the living god   
and stedfast for ever   
and his kingdom that which shall 
not be destroyed   
and his dominion shall be even 
unto the end   
28he delivereth and rescueth   
and he worketh signs and wonders  
in heaven and in earth   
who hath delive red daniel from the 
power of the lions   
29so this daniel prospered in the reign 
of darius  and in the reign of cyrus the 
persian   
 
in the first year of belshazzar 
king of babylon daniel had a 
dream and visions of his head upon his 
bed then he wrote t he dream and told 
the sum of the matters  2daniel spoke 
and said  i saw in my vision by night  
and behold  the four winds of the 
heaven broke forth upon the great sea  
3and four great beasts came up from 7 daniel  
1212  
 the sea  diverse one from another  4the 
first was l ike a lion  and had eagle s 
wings  i beheld till the wings thereof 
were plucked off  and it was lifted up 
from the earth  and made stand upon 
two feet as a man  and a man s heart 
was given to it  5and behold another 
beast  a second  like to a bear  and it 
raised up itself on one side  and it had 
three ribs in its mouth between its 
teeth  and it was said thus unto it  
arise  devour much flesh  6after this 
i beheld  and lo another  like a leopard  
which had upon the sides of it four 
wings of a fowl  the bea st had also 
four heads  and dominion was given to 
it 7after this i saw in the night visions  
and behold a fourth beast  dreadful and 
terrible  and strong exceedingly  and it 
had great iron teeth  it devoured and 
broke in pieces  and stamped the 
residue wi th its feet  and it was diverse 
from all the beasts that were before it  
and it had ten horns  8i considered the 
horns  and behold  there came up 
among them another horn  a little one  
before which three of the first horns 
were plucked up by the roots  and 
behold  in this horn were eyes like the 
eyes of a man  and a mouth speaking 
great things  9i beheld  
till thrones were placed   
and one that was ancient of days 
did sit   
his raiment was as white snow   
and the hair of his head like pure 
wool   
his thro ne was fiery flames  and the 
wheels thereof burning fire   10a fiery stream issued  
and came forth from before him  
thousand thousands ministered 
unto him   
and ten thousand times ten 
thousand stood before him   
the judgment was set   
and the books were op ened  
11i beheld at that time because of the 
voice of the great words which the 
horn spoke  i beheld even till the beast 
was slain  and its body destroyed  and 
it was given to be burned with fire  
12and as for the rest of the beasts  their 
dominion was ta ken away  yet their 
lives were prolonged for a season and 
a time   
13i saw in the night visions   
and behold  there came with the 
clouds of heaven  
one like unto a son of man   
and he came even to the ancient of 
days  
and he was brought near before 
him  
14and there was given him 
dominion   
and glory  and a kingdom   
that all the peoples  nations  and 
languages  
should serve him   
his dominion is an everlasting 
dominion  which shall not pass 
away   
and his kingdom that which shall 
not be destroyed   
15as for me daniel  my spirit was 
pained in the midst of my body  and 
the visions of my head affrighted me  daniel  
1213  
 16i came near unto one of them that 
stood by  and asked him the truth 
concerning all this  so he told me  and 
made me know the interpretation of 
the thin gs 17these great beasts  which 
are four  are four kings  that shall arise 
out of the earth  18but the saints of the 
most high shall receive the kingdom  
and possess the kingdom for ever  
even for ever and ever  19then i 
desired to know the truth concern ing 
the fourth beast  which was diverse 
from all of them  exceeding terrible  
whose teeth were of iron  and its nails 
of brass  which devoured  brake in 
pieces  and stamped the residue with 
its feet  20and concerning the ten horns 
that were on its head  and the other 
horn which came up  and before which 
three fell  even that horn that had eyes  
and a mouth that spoke great things  
whose appearance was greater than 
that of its fellows  21i beheld  and the 
same horn made war with the saints  
and prevailed aga inst them  22until the 
ancient of days came  and judgment 
was given for the saints of the most 
high  and the time came  and the 
saints possessed the kingdom  23thus 
he said  the fourth beast shall be a 
fourth kingdom upon earth  which 
shall be diverse fro m all the kingdoms  
and shall devour the whole earth  and 
shall tread it down  and break it in 
pieces  24and as for the ten horns  out 
of this kingdom shall ten kings arise  
and another shall arise after them  and 
he shall be diverse from the former  
and h e shall put down three kings  25and he shall speak words against the 
most high  and shall wear out the 
saints of the most high  and he shall 
think to change the seasons and the 
law and they shall be given into his 
hand until a time and times and half a 
time 26but the judgment shall sit  and 
his dominions shall be taken away  to 
be consumed and to be destroy unto 
the end  27and the kingdom and the 
dominion  and the greatness of the 
kingdoms under the whole heaven  
shall be given to the people of the 
saints  of the most high  their kingdom 
is an everlasting kingdom  and all 
dominions shall serve and obey them  
28here is the end of the matter  as for 
me daniel  my thoughts much 
affrighted me  and my countenance 
was changed in me  but i kept the 
matter in my h eart  
in the third year of the reign of 
king belshazzar a vision appeared 
unto me  even unto me daniel  after 
that which appeared unto me at the 
first 2and i saw in the vision  now it 
was so  that when i saw  i was in 
shushan the castle  which is in th e 
province of elam  and i saw in the 
vision  and i was by the stream ulai  
3and i lifted up mine eyes  and saw  
and behold  there stood before the 
stream a ram which had two horns  
and the two horns were high  but one 
was higher than the other  and the 
higher came up last  4i saw the ram 
pushing westward  and northward  and 
southward  and no beasts could stand 
before him  neither was there any that 8 daniel  
1214  
 could deliver out of his hand  but he 
did according to his will  and 
magnified himself   
5and as i was consid ering  behold  a 
hegoat came from the west over the 
face of the whole earth  and touched 
not the ground  and the goat had a 
conspicuous horn between his eyes  
6and he came to the ram that had the 
two horns  which i saw standing 
before the stream  and ran at him in the 
fury of his power  7and i saw him 
come close unto the ram  and he was 
moved with choler against him  and 
smote the ram  and broke his two 
horns  and there was no power in the 
ram to stand before him  but he cast 
him down to the ground  and tr ampled 
upon him  and there was none that 
could deliver the ram out of his hand  
8and the he goat magnified himself 
exceedingly  and when he was strong  
the great horn was broken  and instead 
of it there came up the appearance of 
four horns toward the four winds of 
heaven   
9and out of one of them came forth 
a little horn  which waxed exceeding 
great  toward the south  and toward the 
east and toward the beauteous land  
10and it waxed great  even to the host 
of heaven  and some of the host and of 
the stars i t cast down to the ground  
and trampled upon them  11yea it 
magnified itself  even to the prince of 
the host  and from him the continual 
burnt offering was taken away  and the 
place of his sanctuary was cast down  
12and the host was given over to it toget her with the continual burnt 
offering through transgression  and it 
cast down truth to the ground  and it 
wrought  and prospered  13then i 
heard a holy one speaking  and another 
holy one said unto that certain one 
who spoke  how long shall be the 
vision c oncerning the continual burnt 
offering  and the transgression that 
causes appalment  to give both the 
sanctuary and the host to be trampled 
under foot  14and he said unto me  
unto two thousand and three hundred 
evenings and mornings  then shall the 
sanct uary be victorious   
15and it came to pass  when i  even 
i daniel  had seen the vision  that i 
sought to understand it  and behold  
there stood before me as the 
appearance of a man  16and i heard the 
voice of a man between the banks of 
ulai who called  and said  gabriel  
make this man to understand the 
vision  17so he came near where i 
stood  and when he came  i was 
terrified  and fell upon my face  but he 
said unto me  understand  o son of 
man for the vision belongeth to the 
time of the end  18now as he was 
speaking with me  i fell into a deep 
sleep with my face toward the ground  
but he touched me  and set me upright  
19and he said  behold  i will make 
thee know what shall be in the latter 
time of the indignation  for it 
belongeth to the appointed  time of the 
end 20the ram which thou sawest 
having the two horns  they are the 
kings of media and persia  21and the daniel  
1215  
 rough he goat is the king of greece  
and the great horn that is between his 
eyes is the first king  22and as for that 
which was broken  in the place 
whereof four stood up  four kingdoms 
shall stand up out of the nation  but not 
with his power  23and in the latter time 
of their kingdom  when the 
transgressors have completed their 
transgression  there shall stand up a 
king of fierce countenanc e and 
understanding stratagems  24and his 
power shall be mighty  but not by his 
own power  and he shall destroy 
wonderfully  and shall prosper and do  
and he shall destroy them that are 
mighty and the people of the saints  
25and through his cunning he sha ll 
cause craft to prosper in his hand  and 
he shall magnify himself in his heart  
and in time of security shall he destroy 
many  he shall also stand up against 
the prince of princes  but he shall be 
broken without hand  26and the vision 
of the evenings and  mornings which 
hath been told is true  but thou  shut 
thou up the vision  for it belongeth to 
many days to come  27and i daniel 
fainted  and was sick certain days  then 
i rose up  and did the king s business  
and i was appalled at the vision  but 
underst ood it not   
 
in the first year of darius the son 
of ahasuerus  of the seed of the 
medes  who was made king over the 
realm of the chaldeans  2in the first 
year of his reign i daniel meditated in 
the books  over the number of the years  whereof the word o f the lord 
came to jeremiah the prophet  that he 
would accomplish for the desolations 
of jerusalem seventy years  3and i set 
my face unto the lord god  to seek by 
prayer and supplications  with fasting  
and sackcloth  and ashes  4and i 
prayed unto the lord my god  and 
made confession  and said  o lord  
the great and awful god  who keepest 
covenant and mercy with them that 
love thee and keep thy 
commandments  5we have sinned  and 
have dealt iniquitously  and have done 
wickedly  and have rebelled  and have 
turned aside from thy commandments 
and from thine ordinances  6neither 
have we hearkened unto thy servants 
the prophets  that spoke in thy name 
to our kings  our princes  and our 
fathers  and to all the people of the 
land 7unto thee  o lord  belongeth 
righteousness  but unto us confusion of 
face as at this day  to the men of 
judah  and to the inhabitants of 
jerusalem  and unto all israel  that are 
near and that are far off  through all 
the countries whither thou hast driven 
them  because they dealt treach erously 
with thee  8o lord to us belongeth 
confusion of face  to our kings  to our 
princes  and to our fathers  because we 
have sinned against thee  9to the lord 
our god belong compassions and 
forgivenesses  for we have rebelled 
against him  10neither hav e we 
hearkened to the voice of the lord our 
god to walk in his laws  which he set 
before us by his servants the prophets  9 daniel  
1216  
 11yea all israel have transgressed thy 
law and have turned aside  so as not to 
hearken to thy voice  and so there 
hath been poured out upon us the curse 
and the oath that is written in the law 
of moses the servant of god  for we 
have sinned against him  12and he 
hath confirmed his word  which he 
spoke against us  and against our 
judges that judged us  by bringing 
upon us a great evil  so that under the 
whole heaven hath not been done as 
hath been done upon jerusalem  13as it 
is written in the law of moses  all this 
evil is come upon us  yet have we not 
entreated the favour of the lord our 
god that we might turn from our 
iniquities  and have discernment in 
thy truth  14and so the lord hath 
watched over the evil  and brought it 
upon us  for the lord our god is 
righteous in all his works which he 
hath done  and we have not hearkened 
to his voice  15and now  o lord our 
god that hast broug ht thy people 
forth out of the land of egypt with a 
mighty hand  and hast gotten thee 
renown  as at this day  we have sinned  
we have done wickedly  16o lord  
according to all thy righteousness  let 
thine anger and thy fury  i pray thee  
be turned away fro m thy city 
jerusalem  thy holy mountain  
because for our sins  and for the 
iniquities of our fathers  jerusalem and 
thy people are become a reproach to 
all that are about us  17now therefore  
o our god  hearken unto the prayer of 
thy servant  and to his su pplications  and cause thy face to shine upon thy 
sanctuary that is desolate  for the 
lord s sake  18o my god  incline 
thine ear  and hear  open thine eyes  
and behold our desolations  and the 
city upon which thy name is called  
for we do not present our s upplications 
before thee because of our 
righteousness  but because of thy 
great compassions  19o lord  hear o 
lord  forgive  o lord  attend and do  
defer not  for thine own sake  o my 
god because thy name is called upon 
thy city and thy people   
20and w hile i was speaking  and 
praying  and confessing my sin and the 
sin of my people israel  and presenting 
my supplication before the lord my 
god for the holy mountain of my god  
21yea while i was speaking in prayer  
the man gabriel  whom i had seen in 
the v ision at the beginning  being 
caused to fly swiftly  approached close 
to me about the time of the evening 
offering  22and he made me to 
understand  and talked with me  and 
said o daniel  i am now come forth 
to make thee skilful of understanding  
23at the  beginning of thy supplications 
a word went forth  and i am come to 
declare it  for thou art greatly beloved  
therefore look into the word  and 
understand the vision  24seventy weeks 
are decreed upon thy people and upon 
thy holy city  to finish the 
transgr ession  and to make an end of 
sin and to forgive iniquity  and to 
bring in everlasting righteousness  and 
to seal vision and prophet  and to daniel  
1217  
 anoint the most holy place  25know 
therefore and discern  that from the 
going forth of the word to restore and 
to build jerusalem unto one anointed  a 
prince  shall be seven weeks  and for 
threescore and two weeks  it shall be 
built again  with broad place and moat  
but in troublous times  26and after the 
threescore and two weeks shall an 
anointed one be cut off  and be no 
more  and the people of a prince that 
shall come shall destroy the city and 
the sanctuary  but his end shall be with 
a flood  and unto the end of the war 
desolations are determined  27and he 
shall make a firm covenant with many 
for one week  and for half of the week 
he shall cause the sacrifice and the 
offering to cease  and upon the wing of 
detestable things shall be that which 
causeth appalment  and that until the 
extermination wholly determined be 
poured out upon that which causeth 
appalment   
in the third year of cyrus king 
of persia a word was revealed 
unto daniel  whose name was called 
belteshazzar  and the word was true  
even a great warfare  and he gave heed 
to the word  and had understanding of 
the vision  2in those days i daniel was 
mourn ing three whole weeks  3i ate no 
pleasant bread  neither came flesh nor 
wine in my mouth  neither did i anoint 
myself at all  till three whole weeks 
were fulfilled  4and in the four and 
twentieth day of the first month  as i 
was by the side of the great ri ver 
which is tigris  5i lifted up mine eyes  and looked  and behold a man clothed 
in linen  whose loins were girded with 
fine gold of uphaz  6his body also was 
like the beryl  and his face as the 
appearance of lightning  and his eyes 
as torches of fire  and his arms and his 
feet like in colour to burnished brass  
and the voice of his words like the 
voice of a multitude  7and i daniel 
alone saw the vision  for the men that 
were with me saw not the vision  
howbeit a great trembling fell upon 
them  and they f led to hide themselves  
8so that i was left alone  and saw this 
great vision  and there remained no 
strength in me  for my comeliness was 
turned in me into corruption  and i 
retained no strength  9yet heard i the 
voice of his words  and when i heard 
the vo ice of his words  then was i 
fallen into a deep sleep on my face  
with my face toward the ground  
10and behold  a hand touched me  
which set me tottering upon my knees 
and upon the palms of my hands  
11and he said unto me  o daniel  thou 
man greatly belo ved give heed unto 
the words that i speak unto thee  and 
stand upright  for now am i sent unto 
thee and when he had spoken this 
word unto me  i stood trembling  
12then said he unto me  fear not  
daniel  for from the first day that thou 
didst set thy he art to understand  and 
to humble thyself before thy god  thy 
words were heard  and i am come 
because of thy words  13but the prince 
of the kingdom of persia withstood me 
one and twenty days  but lo michael  10 daniel  
1218  
 one of the chief princes  came to help 
me and i was left over there beside 
the kings of persia  14now i am come 
to make thee understand what shall 
befall thy people in the end of days  
for there is yet a vision for the days   
15and when he had spoken unto me 
according to these words  i set my face 
toward the ground  and was dumb  
16and behold  one like the similitude 
of the sons of men touched my lips  
then i opened my mouth  and spoke 
and said unto him that stood before 
me o my lord  by reason of the 
vision my pains are come upon me  
and i retain no strength  17for how can 
this servant of my lord talk with this 
my lord  for as for me  straightway 
there remained no strength in me  
neither was there breath left in me  
18then there touched me again one like 
the appearance of a man  and he 
strengthene d me  19and he said  o 
man greatly beloved  fear not  peace 
be unto thee  be strong  yea be 
strong  and when he had spoken unto 
me i was strengthened  and said  let 
my lord speak  for thou hast 
strengthened me  20then said he  
knowest thou wherefore i come unto 
thee and now will i return to fight 
with the prince of persia  and when i 
go forth  lo the prince of greece shall 
come  21howbeit i will declare unto 
thee that which is inscribed in the 
writing of truth  and there is none that 
holdeth with me  against these  except 
michael your prince   and as for me  in the first year 
of darius the mede  i stood up 
to be a supporter and a stronghold unto 
him  
2and now will i declare unto thee 
the truth  behold  there shall stand up 
yet three kings in persi a and the 
fourth shall be far richer than they all  
and when he is waxed strong through 
his riches  he shall stir up all against 
the realm of greece  3and a mighty 
king shall stand up  that shall rule with 
great dominion  and do according to 
his will  4and when he shall stand up  
his kingdom shall be broken  and shall 
be divided toward the four winds of 
heaven  but not to his posterity  nor 
according to his dominion wherewith 
he ruled  for his kingdom shall be 
plucked up  even for others beside 
those   
5and the king of the south shall be 
strong  and one of his princes  and he 
shall be strong above him  and have 
dominion  his dominion shall be a 
great dominion   
6and at the end of years they shall 
join themselves together  and the 
daughter of the king of the  south shall 
come to the king of the north to make 
an agreement  but she shall not retain 
the strength of her arm  neither shall 
he stand  nor his arm  but she shall be 
given up  and they that brought her  
and he that begot her  and he that 
obtained her in  those times   
7but one of the shoots of her roots 
shall stand up in his place  and shall 
come unto the army  and shall enter 11 daniel  
1219  
 into the stronghold of the king of the 
north  and shall deal with them  and 
shall prevail  8and also their gods  with 
their molten  images  and with their 
precious vessels of silver and of gold  
shall he bring into captivity into 
egypt  and he shall desist some years 
from the king of the north  9and he 
shall come into the kingdom of the 
king of the south  but he shall return 
into his own land   
10and his sons shall stir themselves 
up and shall assemble a multitude of 
great forces  and he shall come on  and 
overflow  as he passes through  and he 
shall return and stir himself up  even to 
his stronghold  11and the king of the 
south shall  be moved with choler  and 
shall come forth and fight with him  
even with the king of the north  and he 
shall set forth a great multitude  but 
the multitude shall be given into his 
hand  12and the multitude shall be 
carried away  and his heart shall be 
lifted up  and he shall cast down tens 
of thousands  but he shall not prevail  
13and the king of the north shall again 
set forth a multitude  greater than the 
former  and he shall come on at the 
end of the times  even of years  with a 
great army and with much  substance  
14and in those times there shall many 
stand up against the king of the south  
also the children of the violent among 
thy people shall lift themselves up to 
establish the vision  but they shall 
stumble  15and the king of the north 
shall come  and cast up a mound  and 
take a well fortified city  and the arms of the south shall not withstand  and as 
for his chosen people  there shall be no 
strength in them to withstand  16but he 
that cometh against him shall do 
according to his own will  and none 
shall stand before him  and he shall 
stand in the beauteous land  and in his 
hand shall be extermination  17and he 
shall set his face to come with the 
strength of his whole kingdom  but 
shall make an agreement with him  
and he shall give him the daughter of  
women  to destroy it  but it shall not 
stand  neither be for him  18after this 
shall he set his face unto the isles  and 
shall take many  but a captain shall 
cause the reproach offered by him to 
cease  yea he shall cause his own 
reproach to return upon h im 19then he 
shall turn his face toward the 
strongholds of his own land  but he 
shall stumble and fall  and shall not be 
found   
20then shall stand up in his place 
one that shall cause an exactor to pass 
through the glory of the kingdom  but 
within few da ys he shall be destroyed  
neither in anger  nor in battle   
21and in his place shall stand up a 
contemptible person  upon whom had 
not been conferred the majesty of the 
kingdom  but he shall come in time of 
security  and shall obtain the kingdom 
by blandis hments  22and the arms of 
the flood shall be swept away from 
before him  and shall be broken  yea 
also the prince of the covenant  23and 
after the league made with him he 
shall work deceitfully  and he shall daniel  
1220  
 come up and become strong  with a 
little nation  24in time of security shall 
he come even upon the fattest places 
of the province  and he shall do that 
which his fathers have not done  nor 
his fathers fathers  he shall scatter 
among them prey  and spoil  and 
substance  yea he shall devise his 
devices against fortresses  but only 
until the time   
25and he shall stir up his power and 
his courage against the king of the 
south with a great army  and the king 
of the south shall stir himself up to 
battle with a very great and mighty 
army  but he shall not st and for they 
shall devise devices against him  
26yea they that eat of his food shall 
destroy him  and his army shall be 
swept away  and many shall fall down 
slain  27and as for both these kings  
their hearts shall be to do mischief  
and they shall speak lies at one table  
but it shall not prosper  for the end 
remaineth yet for the time appointed  
28and he shall return to his own land 
with great substance  and his heart 
shall be against the holy covenant  and 
he shall do his pleasure  and return to 
his own  land  
29at the time appointed he shall 
return  and come into the south  but it 
shall not be in the latter time as it was 
in the former  30for ships of kittim 
shall come against him  and he shall be 
cowed  and he shall return  and have 
indignation against  the holy covenant  
and shall do his pleasure  and he shall 
return  and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant  31and arms 
shall stand on his part  and they shall 
profane the sanctuary  even the 
stronghold  and shall take away the 
continual b urntoffering  and they shall 
set up the detestable thing that causeth 
appalment  32and such as do wickedly 
against the covenant shall be corrupt 
by blandishments  but the people that 
know their god shall show strength  
and prevail  33and they that are wis e 
among the people shall cause the many 
to understand  yet they shall stumble 
by the sword and by flame  by 
captivity and by spoil  many days  
34now when they shall stumble  they 
shall be helped with a little help  but 
many shall join themselves unto them 
with blandishments  35and some of 
them that are wise shall stumble  to 
refine among them  and to purify  and 
to make white  even to the time of the 
end for it is yet for the time appointed   
36and the king shall do according to 
his will  and he shall exal t himself  and 
magnify himself above every god  and 
shall speak strange things against the 
god of gods  and he shall prosper till 
the indignation be accomplished  for 
that which is determined shall be done  
37neither shall he regard the gods of 
his fathers  and neither the desire of 
women  nor any god  shall he regard  
for he shall magnify himself above all  
38but in his place shall he honour the 
god of strongholds  and a god whom 
his fathers knew not shall he honour 
with gold  and silver  and with 
precious  stones  and costly things  daniel  
1221  
 39and he shall deal with the strongest 
fortresses with the help of a foreign 
god whom he shall acknowledge  
shall increase glory  and he shall cause 
them to rule over many  and shall 
divide the land for a price   
40and at the t ime of the end shall the 
king of the south push at him  and the 
king of the north shall come against 
him like a whirlwind  with chariots  
and with horsemen  and with many 
ships  and he shall enter into the 
countries  and shall overflow  as he 
passes throug h 41he shall enter also 
into the beauteous land  and many 
countries shall be overthrown  but 
these shall be delivered out of his 
hand  edom  and moab  and the chief 
of the children of ammon  42he shall 
stretch forth his hand also upon the 
countries  and t he land of egypt shall 
not escape  43but he shall have power 
over the treasures of gold and silver  
and over all the precious things of 
egypt  and the libyans and the 
ethiopians shall be at his steps  44but 
tidings out of the east and out of the 
north shal l affright him  and he shall 
go forth with great fury to destroy and 
utterly to take away many  45and he 
shall plant the tents of his palace 
between the seas and the beauteous 
holy mountain  and he shall come to 
his end  and none shall help him   
and at  that time shall michael 
stand up  the great prince who 
standeth for the children of thy people  
and there shall be a time of trouble  
such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time  and at 
that time thy people shall be delivered  
every one that shall be found written in 
the book  2and many of them that 
sleep in the dust of the earth shall 
awake  some to everlasting life  and 
some to reproaches and everlasting 
abhorrence  3and they that are wise 
shall shine as the brightness of the 
firmam ent and they that turn the many 
to righteousness as the stars for ever 
and ever  4but thou  o daniel  shut up 
the words  and seal the book  even to 
the time of the end  many shall run to 
and fro  and knowledge shall be 
increased   
5then i daniel looked  and behold  
there stood other two  the one on the 
bank of the river on this side  and the 
other on the bank of the river on that 
side 6and one said to the man clothed 
in linen  who was above the waters of 
the river  how long shall it be to the 
end of th e wonders  7and i heard the 
man clothed in linen  who was above 
the waters of the river  when he lifted 
up his right hand and his left hand unto 
heaven  and swore by him that liveth 
for ever that it shall be for a time  
times  and a half  and when they ha ve 
made an end of breaking in pieces the 
power of the holy people  all these 
things shall be finished   
8and i heard  but i understood not  
then said i  o my lord  what shall be 
the latter end of these things  9and he 
said go thy way  daniel  for the 
words are shut up and sealed till the 
time of the end  10many shall purify 12 daniel  
1222  
 themselves  and make themselves 
white  and be refined  but the wicked 
shall do wickedly  and none of the 
wicked shall understand  but they that 
are wise shall understand  11and from 
the time that the continual burnt 
offering shall be taken away  and the 
detestable thing that causes appalment set up  there shall be a thousand two 
hundred and ninety days  12happy is 
he that waiteth  and cometh to the 
thousand three hundred and five and 
thirty days  13but go thou thy way till 
the end be  and thou shalt rest  and 
shalt stand up to thy lot  at the end of 
the days

ezra  
 
now in the first year of cyrus 
king of persia  that the word of 
the lord by the mouth of jeremiah 
might be accomplished  the lord 
stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of 
persia  that he made a proclamation 
throughout all his kingdom  and put i t 
also in writing  saying  2thus saith 
cyrus king of persia  all the kingdoms 
of the earth hath the lord the god of 
heaven  given me  and he hath 
charged me to build him a house in 
jerusalem  which is in judah  
3whosoever there is among you of all 
his pe oplehis god be with him let 
him go up to jerusalem  which is in 
judah  and build the house of the 
lord the god of israel  he is the god 
who is in jerusalem  4and whosoever 
is left  in any place where he 
sojourneth  let the men of his place 
help him with silver  and with gold  
and with goods  and with beasts  
beside the freewill offering for the 
house of god which is in jerusalem   
5then rose up the heads of 
fathers houses of judah and benjamin  
and the priests  and the levites  even 
all whose spirit god had stirred to go 
up to build the house of the lord 
which is in jerusalem  6and all they 
that were round about them 
strengthened their hands with vessels 
of silver  with gold  with goods  and 
with beasts  and with precious things  beside all that was willi ngly offered  
7also cyrus the king brought forth the 
vessels of the house of the lord 
which nebuchadnezzar had brought 
forth out of jerusalem  and had put 
them in the house of his gods  8even 
those did cyrus king of persia bring 
forth by the hand of mithr edath the 
treasurer  and numbered them unto 
sheshbazzar  the prince of judah  9and 
this is the number of them  thirty

that is  the genealogy  but it was not 
found  therefore were they deemed 
polluted and put from t he priesthood  
63and the atirshatha said unto them  
that they should not eat of the most 
holy things  till there stood up a priest 
with urim and with thummim   
 
                                                      
a that is governor  ezra  
1226  
 64the whole congregation together 
was forty and two thousand three 
hundred and threescore  65beside their 
menservants and their maid servants  
of whom there were seven thousand 
three hundred thirty and seven  and 
they had two hundred singing men and 
singing women  66their horses were 
seven hundred thirty and six  their 
mules  two hundred forty and five 
67their camels  four hundred thirty and 
five their asses  six thousand seven 
hundred and twenty   
68and some of the heads of 
fathers houses  when they came to the 
house of the lord which is in 
jerusalem  offered willingly for the 
house of god to set  it up in its place  
69they gave after their ability into the 
treasury of the work threescore and 
one thousand darics of gold  and five 
thousand pounds of silver  and one 
hundred priests tunics   
70so the priests  and the levites  and 
some of the people  and the singers  
and the porters  and the nethinim  
dwelt in their cities  and all israel in 
their cities   
and when the seventh month was 
come  and the children of israel 
were in the cities  the people gathered 
themselves together as one man to 
jerusalem  2then stood up jeshua the 
son of jozadak  and his brethren the 
priests  and zerubbabel the son of 
shealtiel  and his brethren  and builded 
the altar of the god of israel  to offer 
burnt offerings thereon  as it is written 
in the law of moses the man of g od 3and they set the altar upon its bases  
for fear was upon them because of the 
people of the countries  and they 
offered burnt offerings thereon unto 
the lord even burnt offerings 
morning and evening  4and they kept 
the feast of tabernacles  as it is w ritten  
and offered the daily burnt offerings 
by number  according to the ordinance  
as the duty of every day required  5and 
afterward the continual burnt offering  
and the offerings of the new moons  
and of all the appointed seasons of the 
lord that were hallowed  and of every 
one that willingly offered a freewill 
offering unto the lord 6from the first 
day of the seventh month began they 
to offer burnt offerings unto the lord 
but the foundation of the temple of the 
lord was not yet laid  7they gave 
money  also unto the hewers  and to the 
carpenters  and food  and drink  and 
oil unto them of zidon  and to them of 
tyre  to bring cedar trees from 
lebanon to the sea  unto joppa  
according to the grant that they had of 
cyrus king of persia   
8now in the second  year of their 
coming unto the house of god at 
jerusalem  in the second month  began 
zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  and 
jeshua the son of jozadak  and the rest 
of their brethren the priests and the 
levites  and all they that were come 
out of the captivit y unto jerusalem  
and appointed the levites  from 
twenty years old and upward  to have 
the oversight of the work of the house 
of the lord 9then stood jeshua with 3 ezra  
1227  
 his sons and his brethren  and kadmiel 
and his sons  the sons of judah  
together  to have the  oversight of the 
workmen in the house of god  the sons 
of henadad also  with their sons and 
their brethren the levites  10and when 
the builders laid the foundation of the 
temple of the lord they set the priests 
in their apparel with trumpets  and the 
levites the sons of asaph with 
cymbals  to praise the lord according 
to the direction of david king of israel  
11and they sang one to another in 
praising and giving thanks unto the 
lord for he is good  for his mercy 
endureth for ever toward israel  and 
all the people shouted with a great 
shout  when they praised the lord 
because the foundation of the house of 
the lord was laid  12but many of the 
priests and levites and heads of 
fathers houses  the old men that had 
seen the first house standing on its 
foundation  wept with a loud voice  
when this house was before their eyes  
and many shouted aloud for joy  13so 
that the people could not discern the 
noise of the shout of joy from the 
noise of the weeping of the people  for 
the people shouted with a loud shou t 
and the noise was heard afar off   
now when the adversaries of 
judah and benjamin heard that 
the children of the captivity were 
building a temple unto the lord the 
god of israel  2then they drew near to 
zerubbabel  and to the heads of 
fathers houses  and said unto them  
let us build with you  for we seek your god  as ye do  and we do 
sacrifice unto him since the days of 
esarhaddon king of assyria  who 
brought us up hither  3but 
zerubbabel  and jeshua  and the rest of 
the heads of fathers houses of i srael  
said unto them  ye have nothing to do 
with us to build a house unto our god  
but we ourselves together will build 
unto the lord the god of israel  as 
king cyrus the king of persia hath 
commanded us  4then the people of 
the land weakened the hands  of the 
people of judah  and harried them 
while they were building  5and hired 
counsellors against them  to frustrate 
their purpose  all the days of cyrus 
king of persia  even until the reign of 
darius king of persia  6and in the 
reign of ahasuerus  in the  beginning of 
his reign  wrote they an accusation 
against the inhabitants of judah and 
jerusalem   
7and in the days of artaxerxes 
wrote bishlam  mithredath  tabeel  
and the rest of his companions  unto 
artaxerxes king of persia  and the 
writing of the lett er was written in the 
aramaic character  and set forth in the 
aramaic tongue  8rehum the 
commander and shimshai the scribe 
wrote a letter against jerusalem to 
artaxerxes the king in this sort  9then 
wrote rehum the commander  and 
shimshai the scribe  and t he rest of 
their companions  the dinites  and the 
apharesattechites  the tarpelites  the 
apharesites  the archevites  the 
babylonians  the shushanchites  the 4 ezra  
1228  
 dehites  the elamites  10and the rest of 
the nations whom the great and noble 
asenappar brought ov er and set in the 
city of samaria  and the rest that are in 
the country beyond the river  and 
now11this is the copy of the letter 
that they sent unto him  even unto 
artaxerxes the king thy servants the 
men beyond the river and now12be it 
known unto the  king that the jews that 
came up from thee are come to us unto 
jerusalem  they are building the 
rebellious and the bad city  and have 
finished the walls  and are digging out 
the foundations  13be it known now 
unto the king  that if this city be 
builded  and the walls finished  they 
will not pay tribute  impost  or toll  
and so thou wilt endamage the revenue 
of the kings  14now because we eat the 
salt of the palace  and it is not meet for 
us to see the king s dishonour  
therefore have we sent and announced  
to the king  15that search may be made 
in the book of the records of thy 
fathers  so shalt thou find in the book 
of the records  and know that this city 
is a rebellious city  and hurtful unto 
kings and provinces  and that they 
have moved sedition within t he same 
of old time  for which cause was this 
city laid waste  16we announce to the 
king that  if this city be builded  and 
the walls finished  by this means thou 
shalt have no portion beyond the 
river   
17then sent the king an answer unto 
rehum the comma nder and to 
shimshai the scribe  and to the rest of their companions that dwell in 
samaria  and unto the rest beyond the 
river  peace  and now18the letter 
which ye sent unto us hath been 
plainly read before me  19and i 
decreed  and search hath been made  
and it is found that this city of old time 
hath made insurrection against kings  
and that rebellion and sedition have 
been made therein  20there have been 
mighty kings also over jerusalem  who 
have ruled over all the country beyond 
the river  and tribute  impost  and toll  
was paid unto them  21make ye now a 
decree to cause these men to cease  
and that this city be not builded  until a 
decree shall be made by me  22and 
take heed that ye be not slack herein  
why should damage grow to the hurt 
of the kings   
23then when the copy of king 
artaxerxes letter was read before 
rehum  and shimshai the scribe  and 
their companions  they went in haste to 
jerusalem unto the jews  and made 
them to cease by force and power  
24then ceased the work of the house of 
god whic h is at jerusalem  and it 
ceased unto the second year of the 
reign of darius king of persia   
now the prophets  haggai the 
prophet  and zechariah the son of 
iddo prophesied unto the jews that 
were in judah and jerusalem  in the 
name of the god of israel  prophesied 
they unto them  2then rose up 
zerubbabel the son of shealtiel  and 
jeshua the son of jozadak  and began 
to build the house of god which is at 5 ezra  
1229  
 jerusalem  and with them were the 
prophets of god  helping them  3at the 
same time came to them tatten ai the 
governor beyond the river  and 
shethar bozenai  and their 
companions  and said thus unto them  
who gave you a decree to build this 
house  and to finish this structure  
4then spoke we unto them after this 
manner  wrote they  what are the 
names  of the men that build this 
building  5but the eye of their god 
was upon the elders of the jews  and 
they did not make them cease  till the 
matter should come to darius  and 
then answer should be returned by 
letter concerning it   
6the copy of the letter that 
tattenai  the governor beyond the 
river  and shethar bozenai  and his 
companions the apharesachites  who 
were beyond the river  sent unto 
darius the king  7they sent a letter unto 
him wherein was written thus  unto 
darius the king  all peace  8be it  
known unto the king  that we went into 
the province of judah  to the house of 
the great god  which is builded with 
great stones  and timber is laid in the 
walls  and this work goeth on with 
diligence and prospereth in their 
hands  9then asked we those eld ers 
and said unto them thus  who gave 
you a decree to build this house  and to 
finish this wall  10we asked them their 
names also  to announce to thee  that 
we might write the names of the men 
that were at the head of them  11and 
thus they returned us ans wer saying  we are the servants of the god of 
heaven and earth  and build the house 
that was builded these many years ago  
which a great king of israel builded 
and finished  12but because that our 
fathers had provoked the god of 
heaven  he gave them into the hand of 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  the 
chaldean  who destroyed this house  
and carried the people away into 
babylon  13but in the first year of 
cyrus king of babylon  cyrus the king 
made a decree to build this house of 
god 14and the gold and silv er vessels 
also of the house of god  which 
nebuchadnezzar took out of the 
temple that was in jerusalem  and 
brought them into the temple of 
babylon  those did cyrus the king take 
out of the temple of babylon  and they 
were delivered unto one whose name 
was sheshbazzar  whom he had made 
governor  15and he said unto him  take 
these vessels  go put them in the 
temple that is in jerusalem  and let the 
house of god be builded in its place  
16then came the same sheshbazzar  
and laid the foundations of the house 
of god which is in jerusalem  and 
since that time even until now hath it 
been in building  and yet it is not 
completed  17now therefore  if it seem 
good to the king  let search be made in 
the king s treasure house there  which 
is at babylon  whether it be so that a 
decree was made of cyrus the king to 
build this house of god at jerusalem  
and let the king send his pleasure to us 
concerning this matter   ezra  
1230  
 then darius the king made a 
decree  and search was made in 
the house of the archives  where the 
treas ures were laid up  in babylon  
2and there was found at ahmetha  in 
the palace that is in the province of 
media  a roll  and therein was thus 
written  a record  3in the first year of 
cyrus the king  cyrus the king made a 
decree  concerning the house of god  
at jerusalem  let the house be builded  
the place where they offer sacrifices  
and let the foundations thereof be 
strongly laid  the height thereof 
threescore cubits  and the breadth 
thereof threescore cubits  4with three 
rows of great stones  and a row o f new 
timber  and let the expenses be given 
out of the king s house  5and also let 
the gold and silver vessels of the house 
of god  which nebuchadnezzar took 
forth out of the temple which is at 
jerusalem  and brought unto babylon  
be restored  and brought back unto the 
temple which is at jerusalem  every 
one to its place  and thou shalt put 
them in the house of god   
6now therefore  tattenai  governor 
beyond the river  shethar bozenai  
and your companions the 
apharesachites  who are beyond the 
river  be ye far from thence  7let the 
work of this house of god alone  let 
the governor of the jews and the elders 
of the jews build this house of god in 
its place  8moreover i make a decree 
concerning what ye shall do to these 
elders of the jews for the building of  
this house of god  that of the king s goods  even of the tribute beyond the 
river  expenses be given with all 
diligence unto these men  that they be 
not hindered  9and that which they 
have need of  both young bullocks  
and rams  and lambs  for burnt 
offer ings to the god of heaven  wheat  
salt wine  and oil  according to the 
word of the priests that are at 
jerusalem  let it be given them day by 
day without fail  10that they may offer 
sacrifices of sweet savour unto the 
god of heaven  and pray for the life of 
the king  and of his sons  11also i have 
made a decree  that whosoever shall 
alter this word  let a beam be pulled 
out from his house  and let him be 
lifted up and fastened thereon  and let 
his house be made a dunghill for this  
12and may the god that h ath caused 
his name to dwell there overthrow all 
kings and peoples  that shall put forth 
their hand to alter the same  to destroy 
this house of god which is at 
jerusalem  i darius have made a 
decree  let it be done with all 
diligence   
13then tattenai  the governor 
beyond the river  shethar bozenai  
and their companions  because that 
darius the king had thus sent  acted 
with all diligence  14and the elders of 
the jews builded and prospered  
through the prophesying of haggai the 
prophet and zechariah the so n of iddo  
and they builded and finished it  
according to the commandment of the 
god of israel  and according to the 
decree of cyrus  and darius  and 6 ezra  
1231  
 artaxerxes king of persia  15and this 
house was finished on the third day of 
the month adar  which was in the 
sixth year of the reign of darius the 
king  
16and the children of israel  the 
priests and the levites  and the rest of 
the children of the captivity  kept the 
dedication of this house of god with 
joy 17and they offered at the 
dedication of this house  of god a 
hundred bullocks  two hundred rams  
four hundred lambs  and for a sin 
offering for all israel  twelve he goats  
according to the number of the tribes 
of israel  18and they set the priests in 
their divisions  and the levites in their 
courses  for the service of god  which 
is at jerusalem  as it is written in the 
book of moses   
19and the children of the captivity 
kept the passover upon the fourteenth 
day of the first month  20for the priests 
and the levites had purified 
themselves together  all of them were 
pure and they killed the passover 
lamb for all the children of the 
captivity  and for their brethren the 
priests  and for themselves  21and the 
children of israel  that were come back 
out of the captivity  and all such as had 
separated themselve s unto them from 
the filthiness of the nations of the land  
to seek the lord the god of israel  did 
eat 22and kept the feast of unleavened 
bread seven days with joy  for the 
lord had made them joyful  and had 
turned the heart of the king of assyria 
unto them  to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god  the god 
of israel   
 
now after these things  in the 
reign of artaxerxes king of 
persia  ezra the son of seraiah  the son 
of azariah  the son of hilkiah  2the son 
of shallum  the son of zado k the son 
of ahitub  3the son of amariah  the 
son of azariah  the son of meraioth  
4the son of zerahiah  the son of uzzi  
the son of bukki  5the son of abishua  
the son of phinehas  the son of 
eleazar  the son of aaron the chief 
priest  6this ezra went up  from 
babylon  and he was a ready scribe in 
the law of moses  which the lord the 
god of israel  had given  and the king 
granted him all his request  according 
to the hand of the lord his god upon 
him 7and there went up some of the 
children of israel  and of the priests  
and the levites  and the singers  and 
the porters  and the nethinim  unto 
jerusalem  in the seventh year of 
artaxerxes the king  8and he came to 
jerusalem in the fifth month  which 
was in the seventh year of the king  
9for upon the first d ay of the first 
month began he to go up from 
babylon  and on the first day of the 
fifth month came he to jerusalem  
according to the good hand of his god 
upon him  10for ezra had set his heart 
to seek the law of the lord and to do 
it and to teach in isra el statutes and 
ordinances   
11now this is the copy of the letter 
that the king artaxerxes gave unto 7 ezra  
1232  
 ezra the priest  the scribe  even the 
scribe of the words of the 
commandments of the lord and of 
his statutes to israel  12artaxerxes  
king of kings  unto ezra the priest  the 
scribe of the law of the god of 
heaven  and so forth  and now13i make 
a decree  that all they of the people of 
israel  and their priests and the 
levites  in my realm  that are minded 
of their own free will to go with thee 
to jerusale m go 14forasmuch as thou 
art sent of the king and his seven 
counsellors  to inquire concerning 
judah and jerusalem  according to the 
law of thy god which is in thy hand  
15and to carry the silver and gold  
which the king and his counsellors 
have freely o ffered unto the god of 
israel  whose habitation is in 
jerusalem  16and all the silver and gold 
that thou shalt find in all the province 
of babylon  with the freewill offering 
of the people  and of the priests  
offering willingly for the house of 
their god which is in jerusalem  
17therefore thou shalt with all diligence 
buy with this money bullocks  rams  
lambs  with their meal offerings and 
their drink offerings  and shalt offer 
them upon the altar of the house of 
your god which is in jerusalem  18and 
whats oever shall seem good to thee 
and to thy brethren to do with the rest 
of the silver and the gold  that do ye 
after the will of your god  19and the 
vessels that are given thee for the 
service of the house of thy god  
deliver thou before the god of jerusalem  20and whatsoever more 
shall be needful for the house of thy 
god which thou shalt have occasion 
to bestow  bestow it out of the king s 
treasure house  21and i  even i 
artaxerxes the king  do make a decree 
to all the treasurers that are beyond the 
river  that whatsoever ezra the priest  
the scribe of the law of the god of 
heaven  shall require of you  it be done 
with all diligence  22unto a hundred 
talents of silver  and to a hundred 
measures of wheat  and to a hundred 
baths of wine  and to a hundred baths  
of oil  and salt without prescribing 
how much  23whatsoever is 
commanded by the god of heaven  let 
it be done exactly for the house of the 
god of heaven  for why should there 
be wrath against the realm of the king 
and his sons  24also we announce to 
you that touching any of the priests 
and levites  the singers  porters  
nethinim  or servants of this house of 
god it shall not be lawful to impose 
tribute  impost  or toll  upon them  
25and thou  ezra after the wisdom of 
thy god that is in thy hand  appoint  
magistrates and judges  who may 
judge all the people that are beyond 
the river  all such as know the laws of 
thy god  and teach ye him that 
knoweth them not  26and whosoever 
will not do the law of thy god  and the 
law of the king  let judgment be 
executed  upon him with all diligence  
whether it be unto death  or to 
banishment  or to confiscation of 
goods  or to imprisonment   ezra  
1233  
 27blessed be the lord the god of 
our fathers  who hath put such a thing 
as this in the king s heart  to beautify 
the house of the lord which is in 
jerusalem  28and hath extended mercy 
unto me before the king  and his 
counsellors  and before all the king s 
mighty princes  and i was 
strengthened according to the hand of 
the lord my god upon me  and i 
gathered together out of israel chi ef 
men to go up with me   
now these are the heads of their 
fathers houses  and this is the 
genealogy of them that went up with 
me from babylon  in the reign of 
artaxerxes the king  2of the sons of 
phinehas  gershom  of the sons of 
ithamar  daniel  of the  sons of david  
hattush  3of the sons of shecaniah  of 
the sons of parosh  zechariah  and 
with him were reckoned by genealogy 
of the males a hundred and fifty  4of 
the sons of pahath moab  eliehoenai 
the son of zerahiah  and with him two 
hundred males  5of the sons of 
shechaniah  the son of jahaziel  and 
with him three hundred males  6and of 
the sons of adin  ebed the son of 
jonathan  and with him fifty males  
7and of the sons of elam  jeshaiah the 
son of athaliah  and with him seventy 
males  8and of the so ns of shephatiah  
zebadiah the son of michael  and with 
him fourscore males  9of the sons of 
joab obadiah the son of jehiel  and 
with him two hundred and eighteen 
males  10and of the sons of shelomith  
the son of josiphiah  and with him a hundred and thre escore males  11and 
of the sons of bebai  zechariah the son 
of bebai  and with him twenty and 
eight males  12and of the sons of 
azgad  johanan the son of hakkatan  
and with him a hundred and ten males  
13and of the sons of adonikam  that 
were the last  and these are their 
names  eliphelet  jeiel and shemaiah  
and with them threescore males  14and 
of the sons of bigvai  uthai and 
zaccur  and with him seventy males   
15and i gathered them together to 
the river that runneth to ahava  and 
there we encamped thr ee days  and i 
viewed the people  and the priests  and 
found there none of the sons of levi  
16then sent i for eliezer  for ariel  for 
shemaiah  and for elnathan  and for 
jarib  and for elnathan  and for 
nathan  and for zechariah  and for 
meshullam  chief men also for 
joiarib  and for elnathan  teachers  
17and i gave them commandment unto 
iddo the chief at the place casiphia  
and i told them what they should say 
unto iddo and his brother  who were 
set over the place casiphia  that they 
should bring unto us ministers for the 
house of our god  18and according to 
the good hand of our god upon us they 
brought us a man of discretion  of the 
sons of mahli  the son of levi  the son 
of israel  and sherebiah  with his sons 
and his brethren  eighteen  19and 
hashabi ah and with him jeshaiah of 
the sons of merari  his brethren and 
their sons  twenty  20and of the 
nethinim  whom david and the 8 ezra  
1234  
 princes had given for the service of the 
levites  two hundred and twenty 
nethinim  all of them were mentioned 
by name   
21then i  proclaimed a fast there  at 
the river ahava  that we might humble 
ourselves before our god  to seek of 
him a straight way  for us  and for our 
little ones  and for all our substance  
22for i was ashamed to ask of the king 
a band of soldiers and horsemen t o 
help us against the enemy in the way  
because we had spoken unto the king  
saying  the hand of our god is upon 
all them that seek him  for good  but 
his power and his wrath is against all 
them that forsake him  23so we fasted 
and besought our god for t his and he 
was entreated of us  24then i separated 
twelve of the chiefs of the priests  
besides sherebiah  hashabiah  and ten 
of their brethren with them  25and 
weighed unto them the silver  and the 
gold and the vessels  even the offering 
for the house o f our god  which the 
king and his counsellors  and his 
princes  and all israel there present  
had offered  26i even weighed into 
their hand six hundred and fifty talents 
of silver  and silver vessels a hundred 
talents  of gold a hundred talents  27and 
twenty bowels of gold  of a thousand 
darics  and two vessels of fine bright 
brass  precious as gold  28and i said 
unto them  ye are holy unto the lord 
and the vessels are holy  and the silver 
and the gold are a freewill offering 
unto the lord the god of yo ur fathers  
29watch ye  and keep them  until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the 
priests and the levites  and the princes 
of the fathers houses of israel  at 
jerusalem  in the chambers of the 
house of the lord 30so the priests 
and the levites received  the weight of 
the silver and the gold  and the vessels  
to bring them to jerusalem unto the 
house of our god   
31then we departed from the river 
of ahava on the twelfth day of the first 
month  to go unto jerusalem  and the 
hand of our god was upon us  and he 
delivered us from the hand of the 
enemy and lier inwait by the way  
32and we came to jerusalem  and 
abode there three days  33and on the 
fourth day was the silver and the gold 
and the vessels weighed in the house 
of our god into the hand of meremoth 
the son of uriah the priest  and with 
him was eleazar the son of phinehas  
and with them was jozabad the son of 
jeshua  and noadiah the son of binnui  
the levites  34the whole by number 
and by weight  and all the weight was 
written at that time   
35the chil dren of the captivity  that 
were come out of exile  offered burnt 
offerings unto the god of israel  
twelve bullocks for all israel  ninety 
and six rams  seventy and seven 
lambs  twelve he goats for a sin 
offering  all this was a burnt offering 
unto the lord 36and they delivered 
the king s commissions unto the king s 
satraps  and to the governors beyond 
the river  and they furthered the 
people and the house of god   ezra  
1235  
 now when these things were 
done  the princes drew near unto 
me saying  the people of isr ael and 
the priests and the levites  have not 
separated themselves from the peoples 
of the lands  doing according to their 
abominations  even of the canaanites  
the hittites  the perizzites  the 
jebusites  the ammonites  the 
moabites  the egyptians  and t he 
amorites  2for they have taken of their 
daughters for themselves and for their 
sons so that the holy seed have 
mingled themselves with the peoples 
of the lands  yea the hand of the 
princes and rulers hath been first in 
this faithlessness  3and when i  heard 
this thing  i rent my garment and my 
mantle  and plucked off the hair of my 
head and of my beard  and sat down 
appalled  4then were assembled unto 
me every one that trembled at the 
words of the god of israel  because of 
the faithlessness of them of the 
captivity  and i sat appalled until the 
evening offering   
5and at the evening offering i arose 
up from my fasting  even with my 
garment and my mantle rent  and i fell 
upon my knees  and spread out my 
hands unto the lord my god  6and i 
said o my god  i am ashamed and 
blush to lift up my face to thee  my 
god for our iniquities are increased 
over our head  and our guiltiness is 
grown up unto the heavens  7since the 
days of our fathers we have been 
exceeding guilty unto this day  and for 
our iniquities have we  our kings  and our priests  been delivered into the 
hand of the kings of the lands  to the 
sword  to captivity  and to spoiling  
and to confusion of face  as it is this 
day 8and now for a little moment 
grace hath been shown from the lord 
our god  to leave us a remnant to 
escape  and to give us a nail in his 
holy place  that our god may lighten 
our eyes  and give us a little reviving 
in our bondage  9for we are bondmen  
yet our god hath not forsaken us in 
our bondage  but hath extended mercy 
unto u s in the sight of the kings of 
persia  to give us a reviving  to set up 
the house of our god  and to repair the 
ruins thereof  and to give us a fence in 
judah and in jerusalem  10and now  o 
our god  what shall we say after this  
for we have forsaken thy 
commandments  11which thou hast 
commanded by thy servants the 
prophets  saying  the land  unto which 
ye go to possess it  is an unclean land 
through the uncleanness of the peoples 
of the lands  through their 
abominations  wherewith they have 
filled it from o ne end to another with 
their filthiness  12now therefore give 
not your daughters unto their sons  
neither take their daughters unto your 
sons nor seek their peace or their 
prosperity for ever  that ye may be 
strong  and eat the good of the land  
and leave  it for an inheritance to your 
children for ever  13and after all that is 
come upon us for our evil deeds  and 
for our great guilt  seeing that thou 
our god hast punished us less than our 9 ezra  
1236  
 iniquities deserve  and hast given us 
such a remnant  14shall we aga in break 
thy commandments  and make 
marriages with the peoples that do 
these abominations  wouldest not 
thou be angry with us till thou hadst 
consumed us  so that there should be 
no remnant  nor any to escape  15o 
lord the god of israel  thou art 
righteou s for we are left a remnant 
that is escaped  as it is this day  
behold  we are before thee in our 
guiltiness  for none can stand before 
thee because of this   
now while ezra prayed  and 
made confession  weeping and 
casting himself down before the hous e 
of god  there was gathered together 
unto him out of israel a very great 
congregation of men and women and 
children  for the people wept very 
sore 2and shecaniah the son of jehiel  
one of the sons of elam  answered and 
said unto ezra  we have broken fai th 
with our god  and have married 
foreign women of the peoples of the 
land yet now there is hope for israel 
concerning this thing  3now therefore 
let us make a covenant with our god 
to put away all the wives  and such as 
are born of them  according to the  
counsel of the lord and of those that 
tremble at the commandment of our 
god and let it be done according to 
the law  4arise  for the matter 
belongeth unto thee  and we are with 
thee be of good courage  and do it   
5then arose ezra  and made the 
chiefs  of the priests  the levites  and all israel  to swear that they would do 
according to this word  so they swore  
6then ezra rose up from before the 
house of god  and went into the 
chamber of jehohanan the son of 
eliashib  and when he came thither  he 
did e at no bread  nor drink water  for 
he mourned because of the 
faithlessness of them of the captivity  
7and they made proclamation 
throughout judah and jerusalem unto 
all the children of the captivity  that 
they should gather themselves together 
unto jerusale m 8and that whosoever 
came not within three days  according 
to the counsel of the princes and the 
elders  all his substance should be 
forfeited  and himself separated from 
the congregation of the captivity   
9then all the men of judah and 
benjamin gathere d themselves 
together unto jerusalem within the 
three days  it was the ninth month  on 
the twentieth day of the month  and all 
the people sat in the broad place before 
the house of god  trembling because 
of this matter  and for the great rain  
10and ezra t he priest stood up  and 
said unto them  ye have broken faith  
and have married foreign women  to 
increase the guilt of israel  11now 
therefore make confession unto the 
lord the god of your fathers  and do 
his pleasure  and separate yourselves 
from the pe oples of the land  and from 
the foreign women  12then all the 
congregation answered and said with a 
loud voice  as thou hast said  so it is 
for us to do  13but the people are 10 ezra  
1237  
 many  and it is a time of much rain  
and we are not able to stand without  
neither is this a work of one day or 
two for we have greatly transgressed 
in this matter  14let now our princes of 
all the congregation stand  and let all 
them that are in our cities that have 
married foreign women come at 
appointed times  and with them the 
elders of every city  and the judges 
thereof  until the fierce wrath of our 
god be turned from us  as touching 
this matter  15only jonathan the son 
of asahel and jahzeiah the son of 
tikvah stood up against this matter

nehemiah  
 
the word s of nehemiah the son of 
hacaliah   
now it came to pass in the month 
chislev  in the twentieth year  as i was 
in shushan the castle  2that hanani  
one of my brethren  came out of judah  
he and certain men  and i asked them 
concer ning the jews that had escaped  
that were left of the captivity  and 
concerning jerusalem  3and they said 
unto me  the remnant that are left of 
the captivity there in the province are 
in great affliction and reproach  the 
wall of jerusalem also is broken down  
and the gates thereof are burned with 
fire 4and it came to pass  when i 
heard these words  that i sat down and 
wept  and mourned certain days  and i 
fasted and prayed before the god of 
heaven  5and said  i beseech thee  o 
lord the god of heaven  the great and 
awful god  that keepeth covenant and 
mercy with them that love him and 
keep his commandments  6let thine 
ear now be attentive  and thine eyes 
open  that thou mayest hearken unto 
the prayer of thy servant  which i pray 
before thee at this time  day and night  
for the children of israel thy servants  while i confess the sins of the children 
of israel  which we have sinned 
against thee  yea i and my father s 
house have sinned  7we have dealt 
very corruptly against thee  and have 
not kept the com mandments  nor the 
statutes  nor the ordinances which 
thou didst command thy servant 
moses  8remember  i beseech thee  
the word that thou didst command 
thy servant moses  saying  if ye deal 
treacherously  i will scatter you abroad 
among the peoples  9but i f ye return 
unto me  and keep my commandments 
and do them  though your dispersed 
were in the uttermost part of the 
heaven  yet will i gather them from 
thence  and will bring them unto the 
place that i have chosen to cause my 
name to dwell there  10now thes e are 
thy servants and thy people  whom 
thou hast redeemed by thy great 
power  and by thy strong hand  11o 
lord  i beseech thee  let now thine 
ear be attentive to the prayer of thy 
servant  and to the prayer of thy 
servants  who delight to fear thy 
name  and prosper  i pray thee  thy 
servant this day  and grant him mercy 1 nehemiah  
1239  
 in the sight of this man  now i was 
cupbearer to the king   
and it came to pass in the month 
nisan  in the twentieth year of 
artaxerxes the king  when wine was 
before him  that i took up  the wine  
and gave it unto the king  now i had 
not been beforetime sad in his 
presence  2and the king said unto me  
why is thy countenance sad  seeing 
thou art not sick  this is nothing else 
but sorrow of heart  then i was very 
sore afraid  3and i said unto the king  
let the king live for ever  why should 
not my countenance be sad  when the 
city the place of my fathers   
sepulchres  lieth waste  and the gates 
thereof are consumed with fire  4then 
the king said unto me  for what dost 
thou make request  so i prayed to the 
god of heaven  5and i said unto the 
king if it please the king  and if thy 
servant have found favour in thy sight  
that thou wouldest send me unto 
judah  unto the city of my 
fathers sepulchres  that i may build it  
6and the king sa id unto me  the queen 
also sitting by him  for how long 
shall thy journey be  and when wilt 
thou return  so it pleased the king to 
send me  and i set him a time  
7moreover i said unto the king  if it 
please the king  let letters be given me 
to the gover nors beyond the river  that 
they may let me pass through till i 
come unto judah  8and a letter unto 
asaph the keeper of the king s park  
that he may give me timber to make 
beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house  and for the 
wall of the city  and for the house that 
i shall enter into  and the king 
granted me  according to the good 
hand of my god upon me   
9then i came to the governors 
beyond the river  and gave them the 
kings letters  now the king had sent 
with me captains of the  army and 
horsemen  10and when sanballat the 
horonite  and tobiah the servant  the 
ammonite  heard of it  it grieved them 
exceedingly  for that there was come a 
man to seek the welfare of the children 
of israel  11so i came to jerusalem  and 
was there thre e days  12and i arose in 
the night  i and some few men with 
me neither told i any man what my 
god put into my heart to do for 
jerusalem  neither was there any beast 
with me  save the beast that i rode 
upon  13and i went out by night by the 
valley gate  even toward the dragon s 
well and to the dung gate  and viewed 
the walls of jerusalem  which were 
broken down  and the gates thereof 
were consumed with fire  14then i 
went on to the fountain gate and to the 
kings pool  but there was no place for 
the beast that was under me to pass  
15then went i up in the night in the 
valley  and viewed the wall  and i 
turned back  and entered by the valley 
gate and so returned  16and the rulers 
knew not whither i went  or what i did  
neither had i as yet told it to the je ws 
nor to the priests  nor to the nobles  
nor to the rulers  nor to the rest that did 
the work   2 nehemiah  
1240  
 17then said i unto them  ye see 
the evil case that we are in  how 
jerusalem lieth waste  and the gates 
thereof are burned with fire  come and 
let us build up  the wall of jerusalem  
that we be no more a reproach  18and 
i told them of the hand of my god 
which was good upon me  as also of 
the king s words that he had spoken 
unto me  and they said  let us rise up 
and build  so they strengthened their 
hands for the good work  19but when 
sanballat the horonite  and tobiah the 
servant  the ammonite  and geshem 
the arabian  heard it  they laughed us 
to scorn  and despised us  and said  
what is this thing that ye do  will ye 
rebel against the king  20then 
answered i them  and said unto them  
the god of heaven  he will prosper 
us therefore we his servants will arise 
and build  but ye have no portion  nor 
right  nor memorial  in jerusalem   
then eliashib the high priest rose 
up with his brethren the priests

1242  
 to the upper chamber of the corner  
32and between the upper chamber of 
the corner and the sheep gate repaired 
the goldsmiths and the merchants   
33but it came to pass that  when 
sanballat heard that we builded the 
wall he was wroth  and took great 
indignation  and mocked the jews   
34and he spoke before his brethren and 
the army  of samaria  and said  what 
do these feeble jews  will they restore 
at will  will they sacrifice  will they 
make an end this day  will they revive 
the stones out of the heaps of rubbish  
seeing they are burned   35now 
tobiah the ammonite was by him  and 
he said  even that which they build  if 
a fox go up  he shall break down their 
stone wall   36hear  o our god  for we 
are despised  and turn back their 
reproach upon their own head  and 
give them up to spoiling in a land of 
captivity  37and cover not the ir 
iniquity  and let not their sin be blotted 
out from before thee  for they have 
vexed thee before the builders   38so 
we built the wall  and all the wall was 
joined together unto half the height 
thereof  for the people had a mind to 
work    
but it came  to pass that  when 
sanballat  and tobiah  and the 
arabians  and the ammonites  and the 
ashdodites  heard that the repairing of 
the walls of jerusalem went forward  
and that the breaches began to be 
stopped  then they were very wroth   
2and they conspired all of them 
together to come and fight against jerusalem  and to cause confusion 
therein   3but we made our prayer unto 
our god  and set a watch against them 
day and night  because of them  4and 
judah said  the strength of the 
bearers of burdens is decaye d and 
there is much rubbish  so that we are 
not able to build the wall  5and our 
adversaries said  they shall not know  
neither see  till we come into the midst 
of them  and slay them  and cause the 
work to cease  6and it came to pass 
that when the je ws that dwelt by them 
came  they said unto us ten times  ye 
must return unto us from all places  
7therefore set i in the lowest parts of 
the space behind the wall  in the open 
places  i even set the people after their 
families with their swords  their 
spears and their bows  8and i looked  
and rose up  and said unto the nobles  
and to the rulers  and to the rest of the 
people  be not ye afraid of them  
remember the lord  who is great and 
awful  and fight for your brethren  
your sons and your daughters  your 
wives and your houses   
9and it came to pass  when our 
enemies heard that it was known unto 
us and god had brought their counsel 
to nought  that we returned all of us to 
the wall  every one unto his work  
10and it came to pass from that time 
forth  that half of my servants wrought 
in the work  and half of them held the 
spears  the shields  and the bows  and 
the coats of mail  and the rulers were 
behind all the house of judah  11they 
that builded the wall and they that bore 4 nehemiah  
1243  
 burdens laded themselves  every one 
with one of his hands wrought in the 
work  and with the other held his 
weapon  12and the builders  every one 
had his sword girded by his side  and 
so builded  and he that sounded the 
horn was by me  13and i said unto the 
nobles  and to the rulers a nd to the rest 
of the people  the work is great and 
large  and we are separated upon the 
wall one far from another  14in what 
place soever ye hear the sound of the 
horn resort ye thither unto us  our god 
will fight for us   
15so we wrought in the work  and 
half of them held the spears from the 
rising of the morning till the stars 
appeared  16likewise at the same time 
said i unto the people  let every one 
with his servant lodge within 
jerusalem  that in the night they may 
be a guard to us  and may labou r in the 
day 17so neither i  nor my brethren  
nor my servants  nor the men of the 
guard that followed me  none of us put 
off our clothes  every one that went to 
the water had his weapon   
 
then there arose a great cry of the 
people and of their wives a gainst 
their brethren the jews  2for there 
were that said  we our sons and our 
daughters  are many  let us get for 
them corn  that we may eat and live  
3some also there were that said  we 
are mortgaging our fields  and our 
vineyards  and our houses  let us get 
corn because of the dearth  4there 
were also that said  we have borrowed money for the king s tribute 
upon our fields and our vineyards  
5yet now our flesh is as the flesh of 
our brethren  our children as their 
children  and lo we bring into 
bondage our sons and our daughters to 
be servants  and some of our daughters 
are brought into bondage already  
neither is it in our power to help it  for 
other men have our fields and our 
vineyards   
6and i was very angry when i 
heard their cry and these words  7then 
i consulted with myself  and 
contended with the nobles and the 
rulers  and said unto them  ye lend 
upon pledge  every one to his brother  
and i held a great assembly against 
them  8and i said unto them  we after 
our ability have redeemed ou r brethren 
the jews  that sold themselves unto the 
heathen  and would ye nevertheless 
sell your brethren  and should they sell 
themselves unto us  then held they 
their peace  and found never a word  
9also i said  the thing that ye do is 
not good  ought y e not to walk in the 
fear of our god  because of the 
reproach of the heathen our enemies  
10and i likewise  my brethren and my 
servants  have lent them money and 
corn i pray you  let us leave off this 
exaction  11restore  i pray you  to 
them  even this da y their fields  their 
vineyards  their oliveyards  and their 
houses  also the hundred pieces of 
silver  and the corn  the wine  and the 
oil that ye exact of them  12then said 
they we will restore them  and will 5 nehemiah  
1244  
 require nothing of them  so will we do  
even as thou sayest  then i called the 
priests  and took an oath of them  that 
they should do according to this 
promise  13also i shook out my lap  
and said  so god shake out every man 
from his house  and from his labour  
that performeth not this promise  even 
thus be he shaken out  and emptied  
and all the congregation said  amen  
and praised the lord and the people 
did according to this promise   
14moreover from the time that i 
was appointed to be their governor in 
the land of judah  from the twenti eth 
year even unto the two and thirtieth 
year of artaxerxes the king  that is  
twelve years  i and my brethren have 
not eaten the bread of the governor  
15but the former governors that were 
before me laid burdens upon the 
people  and took of them for bread  and 
wine above forty shekels of silver  yea 
even their servants lorded over the 
people  but so did not i  because of the 
fear of god  16yea also i set hand to 
the work of this wall  neither bought 
we any land  and all my servants were 
gathered thither u nto the work  
17moreover there were at my table of 
the jews and the rulers a hundred and 
fifty men  beside those that came unto 
us from among the nations that were 
round about us  18now that which was 
prepared for one day was one ox and 
six choice sheep  also fowls were 
prepared for me  and once in ten days 
store of all sorts of wine  yet for all 
this i demanded not the bread of the governor  because the service was 
heavy upon this people  19remember 
unto me  o my god  for good  all that 
i have done for thi s people   
now it came to pass  when it was 
reported to sanballat and tobiah  
and to geshem the arabian  and unto 
the rest of our enemies  that i had 
builded the wall  and that there was no 
breach left therein though even unto 
that time i had not set up the doors in 
the gates  2that sanballat and geshem 
sent unto me  saying  come  let us 
meet together in one of the villages in 
the plain of ono  but they thought to 
do me mischief  3and i sent 
messengers unto them  saying  i am 
doing a great work  so tha t i cannot 
come down  why should the work 
cease  whilst i leave it  and come down 
to you  4and they sent unto me four 
times after this sort  and i answered 
them after the same manner  5then 
sent sanballat his servant unto me in 
like manner the fifth time with an open 
letter in his hand  6wherein was 
written  it is reported among the 
nations  and ageshem saith it  that thou 
and the jews think to rebel  for which 
cause thou buildest the wall  and thou 
wouldest be their king  even according 
to these words  7and thou hast also 
appointed prophets to proclaim of thee 
at jerusalem  saying  there is a king in 
judah  and now shall it be reported to 
the king according to these words  
come now therefore  and let us take 
                                                      
a heb gashmu  6 nehemiah  
1245  
 counsel together  8then i sent unto 
him sayin g there are no such things 
done as thou sayest  but thou feignest 
them out of thine own heart  9for they 
all would have us afraid  saying  
their hands shall be weakened from 
the work  that it be not done  but 
now strengthen thou my hands   
10and as f or me  i went unto the 
house of shemaiah the son of delaiah 
the son of mehetabel  who was shut 
up and he said  let us meet together 
in the house of god  within the temple  
and let us shut the doors of the temple  
for they will come to slay thee  yea in 
the night will they come to slay thee  
11and i said  should such a man as i 
flee and who is there  that being such 
as i could go into the temple and live  
i will not go in  12and i discerned  
and lo god had not sent him  for he 
pronounced this prop hecy against me  
whereas tobiah and sanballat had 
hired him  13for this cause was he 
hired  that i should be afraid  and do 
so and sin  and that they might have 
matter for an evil report  that they 
might taunt me  14remember  o my 
god tobiah and sanballa t according 
to these their works  and also the 
prophetess noadiah  and the rest of the 
prophets  that would have me put in 
fear  
15so the wall was finished in the 
twenty and fifth day of the month elul  
in fifty and two days  16and it came to 
pass when a ll our enemies heard 
thereof  that all the nations that were 
about us feared  and were much cast down in their own eyes  for they 
perceived that this work was wrought 
of our god  17moreover in those days 
the nobles of judah sent many letters 
unto tobiah  and the letters of tobiah 
came unto them  18for there were 
many in judah sworn unto him  
because he was the son inlaw of 
shecaniah the son of arah  and his son 
jehohanan had taken the daughter of 
meshullam the son of berechiah to 
wife 19also they spoke of  his good 
deeds before me  and reported my 
words to him  and tobiah sent letters 
to put me in fear   
now it came to pass  when the 
wall was built  and i had set up 
the doors  and the porters and the 
singers and the levites were 
appointed  2that i gave my  brother 
hanani  and hananiah the governor of 
the castle  charge over jerusalem  for 
he was a faithful man  and feared god 
above many  3and i said unto them  
let not the gates of jerusalem be 
opened until the sun be hot  and while 
they stand on guard  let them shut the 
doors  and bar ye them  and let 
watches be appointed of the 
inhabitants of jerusalem  every one in 
his watch  and every one to be over 
against his house  4now the city was 
wide and large  but the people were 
few therein  and the houses were  not 
builded  5and my god put into my 
heart to gather together the nobles  and 
the rulers  and the people  that they 
might be reckoned by genealogy  and 
i found the book of the genealogy of 7 nehemiah  
1246  
 them that came up at the first  and i 
found written therein

64these sought  their register  that is

therefore were they deemed polluted 
and put from the priesthood  65and the 
tirshatha said unto them  that they 
should not eat of the most holy things  
till there stood up a priest with urim 
and thummim   
 
66the whole congregation together

a this verse is placed in authorative

which the rest of the people gave was 
twenty thousand darics of gold  and 
two thousand pounds of silver  and 
threescore and seven priests tunics   
73so the priests  and the levites  
and the porters  and the singers  and 
some of the people  and the nethinim  
and all israel  dwelt in their cities   
 
and when the seventh month was 
come  and the children of israel were  
in their cities  1all the people 
gathered themselves together as 
one man into the broad place that was 
before the water gate  and they spoke 
unto ezra the scribe to bring the book 
of the law of moses  which the lord 
had commanded to israel  2and ezra 
the priest brought the law before the 
congregation  both men and women  
and all that could hear with 
understanding  upon the first day of 
the seventh month  3and he read 
therein before the broad place that was 
before the water gate from early 
morning until midday  in the presence 
of the men and the women  and of 
those that co uld understand  and the 
ears of all the people were attentive 
unto the book of the law  4and ezra 
the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood  
which they had made for the purpose  
and beside him stood mattithiah  and 
shema  and anaiah  and uriah  and 
hilkiah  and maaseiah  on his right 
hand  and on his left hand  pedaiah  
and mishael  and malchijah  and 
hashum  and hashbaddanah  8 nehemiah  
1249  
 zechariah  and meshullam  5and ezra 
opened the book in the sight of all the 
people for he was above all the 
people and when he opened i t all the 
people stood up  6and ezra blessed the 
lord the great god  and all the 
people answered  amen  amen  with 
the lifting up of their hands  and they 
bowed their heads  and fell down 
before the lord with their faces to the 
ground  7also jeshua  and bani  and 
sherebiah  jamin  akkub  shabbethai  
hodiah  maaseiah  kelita  azariah  
jozabad  hanan  pelaiah  even the 
levites  caused the people to 
understand the law  and the people 
stood in their place  8and they read in 
the book  in the law of god  
distinctly  and they gave the sense  and 
caused them to understand the reading   
9and nehemiah  who was the 
tirshatha  and ezra the priest the 
scribe  and the levites that taught the 
people  said unto all the people  this 
day is holy unto the lord your god  
mourn not  nor weep  for all the 
people wept  when they heard the 
words of the law  10then he said unto 
them  go your way  eat the fat  and 
drink the sweet  and send portions unto 
him for whom nothing is prepared  for 
this day is holy unto our lord  neith er 
be ye grieved  for the joy of the lord 
is your strength  11so the levites 
stilled all the people  saying  hold 
your peace  for the day is holy  neither 
be ye grieved  12and all the people 
went their way to eat  and to drink  and 
to send portions  and to make great mirth  because they had understood the 
words that were declared unto them   
13and on the second day were 
gathered together the heads of 
fathers houses of all the people  the 
priests  and the levites  unto ezra the 
scribe  even to give attent ion to the 
words of the law  14and they found 
written in the law  how that the lord 
had commanded by moses  that the 
children of israel should dwell in 
booths in the feast of the seventh 
month  15and that they should publish 
and proclaim in all their citie s and in 
jerusalem  saying  go forth unto the 
mount  and fetch olive branches  and 
branches of wild olive  and myrtle 
branches  and palm branches  and 
branches of thick trees  to make 
booths  as it is written  16so the 
people went forth  and brought the m 
and made themselves booths  every 
one upon the roof of his house  and in 
their courts  and in the courts of the 
house of god  and in the broad place 
of the water gate  and in the broad 
place of the gate of ephraim  17and all 
the congregation of them tha t were 
come back out of the captivity made 
booths  and dwelt in the booths  for 
since the days of ajoshua the son of 
nun unto that day had not the children 
of israel done so  and there was very 
great gladness  18also day by day  
from the first day unto the  last day  he 
read in the book of the law of god  
and they kept the feast seven days  
                                                      
a heb jeshua  nehemiah  
1250  
 and on the eighth day was a solemn 
assembly  according unto the 
ordinance   
now in the twenty and fourth day 
of this month the children of 
israel were assembled with fa sting  
and with sackcloth  and earth upon 
them  2and the seed of israel separated 
themselves from all foreigners  and 
stood and confessed their sins  and the 
iniquities of their fathers  3and they 
stood up in their place  and read in the 
book of the law of  the lord their god 
a fourth part of the day  and another 
fourth part they confessed  and 
prostrated themselves before the lord 
their god   
4then stood up upon the platform 
of the levites  jeshua  and bani  
kadmiel  shebaniah  bunni  
sherebiah  bani  and c henani  and 
cried with a loud voice unto the lord 
their god  5then the levites  jeshua  
and kadmiel  bani  hashabneiah  
sherebiah  hodiah  shebaniah  and 
pethahiah  said stand up and bless 
the lord your god from everlasting to 
everlasting  and let them s ay blessed 
be thy glorious name  that is exalted 
above all blessing and praise   
6thou art the lord even thou 
alone  thou hast made heaven  the 
heaven of heavens  with all their host  
the earth and all things that are 
thereon  the seas and all that is in  
them  and thou preservest them all  
and the host of heaven worshippeth 
thee  7thou art the lord the god  who 
didst choose abram  and broughtest him forth out of ur of the chaldees  
and gavest him the name of abraham  
8and foundest his heart faithful befor e 
thee  and madest a covenant with him 
to give the land of the canaanite  the 
hittite  the amorite  and the perizzite  
and the jebusite  and the girgashite  
even to give it unto his seed  and hast 
performed thy words  for thou art 
righteous  9and thou sawe st the 
affliction of our fathers in egypt  and 
heardest their cry by the red sea  
10and didst show signs and wonders 
upon pharaoh  and on all his servants  
and on all the people of his land  for 
thou knewest that they dealt proudly 
against them  and didst get thee a 
name  as it is this day  11and thou 
didst divide the sea before them  so 
that they went through the midst of the 
sea on the dry land  and their pursuers 
thou didst cast into the depths  as a 
stone into the mighty waters  
12moreover in a pillar o f cloud thou 
didst lead them by day  and in a pillar 
of fire by night  to give them light in 
the way wherein they should go  
13thou camest down also upon mount 
sinai  and spokest with them from 
heaven  and gavest them right 
ordinances and laws of truth  good 
statutes and commandments  14and 
madest known unto them thy holy 
sabbath  and didst command them 
commandments  and statutes  and a 
law by the hand of moses thy 
servant  15and gavest them bread from 
heaven for their hunger  and 
broughtest forth water fo r them out of 9 nehemiah  
1251  
 the rock for their thirst  and didst 
command them that they should go in 
to possess the land which thou hadst 
lifted up thy hand to give them   
16but they and our fathers dealt 
proudly  and hardened their neck  and 
hearkened not to thy comman dments  
17and refused to hearken  neither were 
mindful of thy wonders that thou 
didst among them  but hardened their 
neck  and in their rebellion appointed a 
captain to return to their bondage  but 
thou art a god ready to pardon  
gracious and full of compa ssion  slow 
to anger  and plenteous in mercy  and 
forsookest them not  18yea when they 
had made them a molten calf  and said  
this is thy god that brought thee up 
out of egypt  and had wrought great 
provocations  19yet thou in thy 
manifold mercies forsoo kest them not 
in the wilderness  the pillar of cloud 
departed not from over them by day  to 
lead them in the way  neither the pillar 
of fire by night  to show them light  
and the way wherein they should go  
20thou gavest also thy good spirit to 
instruct th em and withheldest not thy 
manna from their mouth  and gavest 
them water for their thirst  21yea forty 
years didst thou sustain them in the 
wilderness  and they lacked nothing  
their clothes waxed not old  and their 
feet swelled not   
22moreover thou gav est them 
kingdoms and peoples  which thou 
didst allot quarter by quarter  so they 
possessed the land of sihon  even the 
land of the king of heshbon  and the land of og king of bashan  23their 
children also didst thou multiply as 
the stars of heaven  and di dst bring 
them into the land  concerning which 
thou didst say to their fathers  that 
they should go in to possess it  24so the 
children went in and possessed the 
land and thou didst subdue before 
them the inhabitants of the land  the 
canaanites  and gaves t them into their 
hands  with their kings  and the 
peoples of the land  that they might do 
with them as they would  25and they 
took fortified cities  and a fat land  and 
possessed houses full of all good 
things  cisterns hewn out  vineyards  
and oliveyards  and fruit trees in 
abundance  so they did eat  and were 
filled  and became fat  and luxuriated 
in thy great goodness   
26nevertheless they were 
disobedient  and rebelled against thee  
and cast thy law behind their back  
and slew thy prophets that did 
forewarn them to turn them back unto 
thee  and they wrought great 
provocations  27therefore thou didst 
deliver them into the hand of their 
adversaries  who distressed them  and 
in the time of their trouble  when they 
cried unto thee  thou heardest from 
heaven  and according to thy 
manifold mercies thou gavest them 
saviours who might save them out of 
the hand of their adversaries  28but 
after they had rest  they did evil again 
before thee  therefore didst thou 
leave them in the hand of their 
enemies  so that th ey had the dominion nehemiah  
1252  
 over them  yet when they returned  and 
cried unto thee  many times didst 
thou hear from heaven  and deliver 
them according to thy mercies  29and 
didst forewarn them  that thou 
mightest bring them back unto thy 
law yet they dealt proudl y and 
hearkened not unto thy 
commandments  but sinned against 
thine ordinances  which if a man do  
he shall live by them  and presented a 
stubborn shoulder  and hardened their 
neck  and would not hear  30yet many 
years didst thou extend mercy unto 
them  and didst forewarn them by thy 
spirit through thy prophets  yet would 
they not give ear  therefore gavest 
thou them into the hand of the peoples 
of the lands  31nevertheless in thy 
manifold mercies thou didst not 
utterly consume them  nor forsake 
them  for thou art a gracious and 
merciful god   
32now therefore  our god  the 
great  the mighty  and the awful god  
who keepest covenant and mercy  let 
not all the travail seem little before 
thee  that hath come upon us  on our 
kings  on our princes  and on our 
priests and on our prophets  and on 
our fathers  and on all thy people  
since the time of the kings of assyria 
unto this day  33howbeit thou art just 
in all that is come upon us  for thou 
hast dealt truly  but we have done 
wickedly  34neither have our kings  our 
princes  our priests  nor our fathers  
kept thy law  nor hearkened unto thy 
commandments and thy testimonies  wherewith thou didst testify against 
them  35for they have not served thee 
in their kingdom  and in thy great 
goodness that thou gavest them  and 
in the large and fat land which thou 
gavest before them  neither turned they 
from their wicked works  36behold  we 
are servants this day  and as for the 
land that thou gavest unto our fathers 
to eat the fruit thereof and the good 
thereof  behold  we a re servants in it  
37and it yieldeth much increase unto 
the kings whom thou hast set over us 
because of our sins  also they have 
power over our bodies  and over our 
cattle  at their pleasure  and we are in 
great distress   
and yet for all this we make a 
sure covenant  and subscribe 
it and our princes  our levites  and 
our priests  set their seal unto it   
2now those that set their seal were

29and the rest of the people  the 
priests  the levites  the porters  the 
singers  the nethinim  and all they that 
had separated themselves from the 
peoples of the lands unto the law of 
god their wives  their sons  and their 
daughters  every one that had 
knowledge and understanding  30they 
cleaved to their brethren  their nobles  
and entered into a curse  and into an 
oath to walk in god s law  which was 
given by moses the servant of god  
and to observe and do all the 
commandments of the lord our lord  
and his ordinances and his statutes  
31and that we would not give our 
daughters unto the peoples of the land  
nor take their daughters for our sons  
32and if the peoples of the land bring 
ware or  any victuals on the sabbath 
day to sell  that we would not buy of 
them on the sabbath  or on a holy day  
and that we would forego the seventh 
year and the exaction of every debt   
33also we made ordinances for us  
to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of 
the house of our god  34for the 
showbread  and for the continual meal 
offering  and for the continual burnt 
offering  of the sabbaths  of the new 
moons  for the appointed seasons  and 
for the holy things  and for the s in
offerings to make atonement for israel  
and for all the work of the house of our 
god 35and we cast lots  the priests  
the levites  and the people  for the 
wood offering  to bring it into the 
house of our god  according to our 
fathers houses  at times a ppointed  
year by year  to burn upon the altar of 
the lord our god  as it is written in the 
law 36and to bring the first fruits of 
our land  and the first fruits of all fruit 
of all manner of trees  year by year  
unto the house of the lord 37also the 
firstborn of our sons  and of our 
cattle  as it is written in the law  and 
the firstlings of our herds and of our 
flocks  to bring to the house of our 
god unto the priests that minister in 
the house of our god  38and that we 
should bring the first of our do ugh 
and our heave offerings  and the fruit 
of all manner of trees  the wine and the 
oil unto the priests  to the chambers of 
the house of our god  and the tithes of 
our land unto the levites  for they  the 
levites  take the tithes in all the cities 
of ou r tillage  39and the priest the son 
of aaron shall be with the levites  
when the levites take tithes  and the 
levites shall bring up the tithe of the 
tithes unto the house of our god  to the 
chambers  into the treasure house  nehemiah  
1254  
 40for the children of israel a nd the 
children of levi shall bring the heave 
offering of the corn  of the wine  and 
of the oil  unto the chambers  where 
are the vessels of the sanctuary  and 
the priests that minister  and the 
porters  and the singers  and we will 
not forsake the house o f our god   
and the princes of the people 
dwelt in jerusalem  the rest of 
the people also cast lots  to bring one 
of ten to dwell in jerusalem the holy 
city and nine parts in the other cities  
2and the people blessed all the men 
that willingly offered themselves to 
dwell in jerusalem   
3now these are the chiefs of the 
province that dwelt in jerusalem  but 
in the cities of judah dwelt every one 
in his possession in their cities  to wit  
israelites  the priests  and the levites  
and the nethinim  and the children of 
solomon s servants  4and in jerusalem 
dwelt certain of the children of judah  
and of the children of benjamin   
of the children of judah  athaiah

them  with the half of the people  upon 
the wall  above the tower of the 
furnaces  even unto the broad wall  
39and above the gate of ephraim  and 
by the gate  of the old city and by the 
fish gate  and the tower of hananel  
and the tower of hammeah  even unto 
the sheep gate  and they stood still in 
the gate of the guard  40so stood the 
two companies of them that gave 
thanks in the house of god  and i  and 
the ha lf of the rulers with me  41and the 
priests  eliakim  maaseiah  miniamin

malchijah  and elam  and ezer  and 
the singers sang  loud with jezrahiah 
their overseer  43and they offered great 
sacrifices that day  and rejoiced  for 
god had made them rejoice with great 
joy and the women also and the 
children rejoiced  so that the joy of 
jerusalem was heard even afar off   
 
44and on t hat day were men 
appointed over the chambers for the 
treasures  for the heave offerings  for 
the first fruits  and for the tithes  to 
gather into them  according to the 
fields of the cities  the portions 
appointed by the law for the priests 
and levites  for judah rejoiced for the 
priests and for the levites that took 
their stations  45and they kept the ward of their god  and the ward of the 
purification  and so did the singers and 
the porters  according to the 
commandment of david  and of 
solomon his son  46for in the days of 
david and asaph of old there were 
chief of the singers  and songs of 
praise and thanksgiving unto god  
47and all israel in the days of 
zerubbabel  and in the days of 
nehemiah  gave the portions of the 
singers and the porters  as every d ay 
required  and they hallowed for the 
levites  and the levites hallowed for 
the sons of aaron   
on that day they read in the 
book of moses in the hearing 
of the people  and therein was found 
written  that an ammonite and a 
moabite should not enter into  the 
assembly of god for ever  2because 
they met not the children of israel with 
bread and with water  but hired 
balaam against them  to curse them  
howbeit our god turned the curse into 
a blessing  3and it came to pass  when 
they had heard the law  that t hey 
separated from israel all the alien 
mixture   
 
4now before this  eliashib the 
priest  who was appointed over the 
chambers of the house of our god  
being allied unto tobiah  5had 
prepared for him a great chamber  
where aforetime they laid the meal 
offer ings the frankincense  and the 
vessels  and the tithes of the corn  the 
wine  and the oil  which were given by 13 nehemiah  
1258  
 commandment to the levites  and the 
singers  and the porters  and the heave 
offerings for the priests  6but in all this 
time i was not at jerusa lem for in the 
two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes 
king of babylon i went unto the king  
and after certain days asked i leave of 
the king  7and i came to jerusalem  and 
understood the evil that eliashib had 
done for tobiah  in preparing him a 
chamber in the courts of the house of 
god 8and it grieved me sore  
therefore i cast forth all the household 
stuff of tobiah out of the chamber  
9then i commanded  and they cleansed 
the chambers  and thither brought i 
again the vessels of the house of god  
with the m ealofferings and the 
frankincense   
10and i perceived that the portions 
of the levites had not been given 
them  so that the levites and the 
singers  that did the work  were fled 
every one to his field  11then 
contended i with the rulers  and said  
why is  the house of god forsaken  
and i gathered them together  and set 
them in their place  12then brought all 
judah the tithe of the corn and the 
wine and the oil unto the treasuries  
13and i made treasurers over the 
treasuries  shelemiah the priest  and 
zado k the scribe  and of the levites  
pedaiah  and next to them was hanan 
the son of zaccur  the son of 
mattaniah  for they were counted 
faithful  and their office was to 
distribute unto their brethren  
14remember me  o my god  concerning this  and wipe not ou t my 
good deeds that i have done for the 
house of my god  and for the wards 
thereof   
15in those days saw i in judah some 
treading winepresses on the sabbath  
and bringing in heaps of corn  and 
lading asses therewith  as also wine  
grapes  and figs  and al l manner of 
burdens  which they brought into 
jerusalem on the sabbath day  and i 
forewarned them in the day wherein 
they sold victuals  16there dwelt men 
of tyre also therein  who brought in 
fish and all manner of ware  and sold 
on the sabbath unto the ch ildren of 
judah  and in jerusalem  17then i 
contended with the nobles of judah  
and said unto them  what evil thing is 
this that ye do  and profane the sabbath 
day 18did not your fathers thus  and 
did not our god bring all this evil upon 
us and upon thi s city  yet ye bring 
more wrath upon israel by profaning 
the sabbath   
19and it came to pass that  when 
the gates of jerusalem began to be 
dark before the sabbath  i commanded 
that the doors should be shut  and 
commanded that they should not be 
opened til l after the sabbath  and some 
of my servants set i over the gates  that 
there should no burden be brought in 
on the sabbath day  20so the merchants 
and sellers of all kind of ware lodged 
without jerusalem once or twice  
21then i forewarned them  and said 
unto them  why lodge ye about the 
wall if ye do so again  i will lay nehemiah  
1259  
 hands on you  from that time forth 
came they no more on the sabbath  
22and i commanded the levites that 
they should purify themselves  and 
that they should come and keep the 
gates  to sanctify the sabbath day  
remember unto me  o my god  this 
also and spare me according to the 
greatness of thy mercy   
23in those days also saw i the jews 
that had married women of ashdod  of 
ammon  and of moab  24and their 
children spoke half in the speec h of 
ashdod  and could not speak in the 
jews language  but according to the 
language of each people  25and i 
contended with them  and cursed them  
and smote certain of them  and 
plucked off their hair  and made them 
swear by god  ye shall not give your 
daughters unto their sons  nor take 
their daughters for your sons  or for 
yourselves  26did not solomon king of 
israel sin by these things  yet among many nations was there no king like 
him and he was beloved of his god  
and god made him king over all israe l 
nevertheless even him did the foreign 
women cause to sin  27shall we then 
hearken unto you to do all this great 
evil to break faith with our god in 
marrying foreign women   
28and one of the sons of joiada  the 
son of eliashib the high priest  was 
soninlaw to sanballat the horonite  
therefore i chased him from me  
29remember them  o my god  because 
they have defiled the priesthood  and 
the covenant of the priesthood  and of 
the levites   
30thus cleansed i them from 
everything foreign  and appointed 
wards for the priests and for the 
levites  every one in his work  31and 
for the wood offering  at times 
appointed  and for the first fruits  
remember me  o my god  for good

now the philistines fought 
against israel  and the men of 
israel fled from before the philistines  
and fell down slain in mount gilboa  
2and the philistines followed hard 
after saul and after his sons  and the 
philistines slew jonathan  and 
abinadab  and malchi shua the sons 
of saul  3and the battle went sore 
against saul  and the archers overtook 
him and he was in anguish by reason 
of the archers  4then said saul unto his 
armour bearer  draw thy sword  and 
thrust me through therewith  lest these 
uncircumcised come and make a mock 
of me  but his armour bearer would 
not for he was sore afraid  therefore 
saul took his sword  and fell upon it  
                                                      
a heb meri baal

saul was dead  he likewise fell upon 
his sword  and died  6so saul died  and 
his three sons  and all his house died 
together  7and when all the men of 
israel that were in the valley saw that 
israel  fled and that saul and his sons 
were dead  they fo rsook their cities  
and fled  and the philistines came and 
dwelt in them   
8and it came to pass on the 
morrow  when the philistines came to 
strip the slain  that they found saul and 
his sons fallen in mount gilboa  9and 
they stripped him  and took his head  
and his armour  and sent into the land 
of the philistines round about  to carry 
the tidings unto their idols  and to the 
people  10and they put his armour in 
the house of their gods  and fastened 
his head in the house of dagon  11and 
when all jabesh gilead heard all that 
the philistines had done to saul  12all 
the valiant men arose  and took away 
the body of saul  and the bodies of his 
sons and brought them to jabesh  and 
buried their bones under the terebinth 
in jabesh  and fasted seven days   
13so saul  died for his transgression 
which he committed against the lord 
because of the word of the lord 
which he kept not  and also for that he 
asked counsel of a ghost  to inquire 
thereby  14and inquired not of the 
lord therefore he slew him  and 
turned the ki ngdom unto david the son 
of jesse   
 10 first chronicles  
1276  
 then all israel gathered 
themselves to david unto 
hebron  saying  behold  we are thy 
bone and thy flesh  2in times past  even 
when saul was king  it was thou that 
didst lead out and bring in israel  and 
the lord thy god said unto thee  thou 
shalt feed my people israel  and thou 
shalt be prince over my people israel  
3so all the elders of israel came to the 
king to hebron  and david made a 
covenant with them in hebron before 
the lord and they anointed david 
king ove r israel  according to the word 
of the lord by the hand of samuel   
4and david and all israel went to 
jerusalem the same is jebus and 
the jebusites  the inhabitants of the 
land were there  5and the inhabitants 
of jebus said to david  thou shalt not 
come in hither  nevertheless david 
took the stronghold of zion  the same 
is the city of david  6and david said  
whosoever smiteth the jebusites first 
shall be chief and captain  and joab 
the son of zeruiah went up first  and 
was made chief  7and david dwelt in 
the stronghold  therefore they called it 
the city of david  8and he built the 
city round about  from millo even 
round about  and joab repaired the rest 
of the city  9and david waxed greater 
and greater  for the lord of hosts was 
with him   
10now these a re the chief of the 
mighty men whom david had  who 
held strongly with him in his kingdom  
together with all israel  to make him 
king according to the word of the lord concerning israel  11and this is 
the number of the mighty men whom 
david had  jashobeam  the son of a 
hachmonite  the chief of the captains  
he lifted up his spear against three 
hundred and slew them at one time   
12and after him was eleazar the 
son of dodo  the ahohite  who was 
one of the three mighty men  13he was 
with david at pas dammim  and there 
the philistines were gathered together 
to battle  where was a plot of ground 
full of barley  and the people fled from 
before the philistines  14but they stood 
in the midst of the plot  and defended 
it and slew the philistines  and the 
lord saved  them by a great victory   
15and three of the thirty chiefs 
went down to the rock to david  unto 
the cave of adullam  and the host of 
the philistines were encamped in the 
valley of rephaim  16and david was 
then in the stronghold  and the garrison 
of the ph ilistines was then in beth 
lehem  17and david longed  and said  
oh that one would give me water to 
drink of the well of beth lehem  which 
is by the gate   18and the three broke 
through the host of the philistines  and 
drew water out of the well of beth 
lehem  that was by the gate  and took 
it and brought it to david  but david 
would not drink thereof  but poured it 
out unto the lord 19and said  my 
god forbid it me  that i should do this  
shall i drink the blood of these men 
that have put their lives in  jeopardy  
for with the jeopardy of their lives they 
brought it  therefore he would not 11 first chronicles  
1277  
 drink it  these things did the three 
mighty men   
20and aabishai  the brother of joab  
he was chief of the three  for he lifted 
up his spear against three hundred and 
slew them  and had a name among the 
three  21of the three in the second rank 
he was the most honourable  and was 
made their captain  howbeit he 
attained not to the first three   
22beniah the son of jehoiada  the 
son of a valiant man of kabzeel  who 
had don e mighty deeds  he smote the 
two altar hearths of moab  he went 
down also and slew a lion in the midst 
of a pit in time of snow  23and he slew 
an egyptian  a man of great stature  
five cubits high  and in the egyptian s 
hand was a spear like a weaver s 
beam and he went down to him with a 
staff and plucked the spear out of the 
egyptian s hand  and slew him with 
his own spear  24these things did 
benaiah the son of jehoiada  and had a 
name among the three mighty men  
25behold  he was more honourable 
than the  thirty  but he attained not to 
the first three  and david set him over

meet them  and answered and said 
unto them  if ye be co me peaceably

a that is david and his men  first chronicles

there with david three days  eating and 
drinking  for their brethren had made 
preparation for them  41moreover they 
that were nigh unto them  even as far 
as issachar and zebulun and naphtali  
brought bread on asses  and on camels  
and on mules  and on oxen  victual of 
meal  cakes of figs  and clusters of 
raisins  and wine  and oil  and oxen  
and sheep in abundance  for there was 
joy in israel   
and david consulted with the 
captains of thousands and of 
hundreds  even with every leader  
2and david said  unto all the assembly 13 first chronicles  
1280  
 of israel  if it seem good unto you  
and if it be of the lord our god  let us 
send abroad everywhere unto our 
brethren that are left in all the land of 
israel  and with them to the priests and 
levites that are in their cities that h ave 
open land about them  that they may 
gather themselves unto us  3and let us 
bring back the ark of our god to us  
for we sought not unto it in the days of 
saul 4and all the assembly said that 
they would do so  for the thing was 
right in the eyes of all  the people  5so 
david assembled all israel together  
from shihor the brook of egypt even 
unto the entrance of hamath  to bring 
the ark of god from kiriath jearim   
6and david went up  and all israel  
to baalah  that is  to kiriath jearim  
which belonged t o judah  to bring up 
from thence the ark of god  the lord 
that sitteth upon the cherubim  
whereon is called the name  7and they 
set the ark of god upon a new cart  
and brought it  out of the house of 
abinadab  and uzza and ahio drove 
the cart  8and david and all israel 
played before god with all their might  
even with songs  and with harps  and 
with psalteries  and with timbrels  and 
with cymbals  and with trumpets  9and 
when they came unto the threshing 
floor of chidon  uzza put forth his 
hand to hold the  ark for the oxen 
stumbled  10and the anger of the lord 
was kindled against uzza  and he 
smote him  because he put forth his 
hand to the ark  and there he died 
before god  11and david was displeased  because the lord had 
broken forth upon uzza  and that p lace 
was called aperez uzza unto this day  
12and david was afraid of god that 
day saying  how shall i bring the ark 
of god home to me  13so david 
removed not the ark unto him into the 
city of david  but carried it aside into 
the house of obed edom the g ittite 
14and the ark of god remained with 
the family of obed edom in his house 
three months  and the lord blessed the 
house of obed edom  and all that he 
had  
and huram king of tyre sent 
messengers to david  and 
cedar trees  and masons  and 
carpenters  to build him a house  2and 
david perceived that the lord had 
established him king over israel  for 
his kingdom was exalted exceedingly  
for his people israel s sake   
3and david took more wives at 
jerusalem  and david begot more sons 
and daughters  4and these are the 
names of the children whom he had in 
jerusalem  shammua  and shobab  
nathan  and solomon  5and ibhar  and 
elishua  and elpelet  6and nogah  and 
nepheg  and japhia  7and elishama  
and beeliada  and eliphelet   
8and when the philistines heard 
that david was anointed king over all 
israel  all the philistines went up to 
seek david  and david heard of it  and 
went out to meet them  9now the 
philistines had come and made a raid 
                                                      
a that is the breach of uzza  14 first chronicles  
1281  
 in the valley of rephaim  10and david 
inquired of god  saying  shall i go up 
against the philistines  and wilt thou 
deliver them into my hand  and the 
lord said unto him  go up  for i will 
deliver them into thy hand  11so they 
came up to baal perazim  and david 
smote them there  and david said  
god hath broken mine enemie s by my 
hand  like the breach of waters  
therefore they called the name of that 
place abaalperazim  12and they left 
their gods there  and david gave 
commandment  and they were burned 
with fire   
13and the philistines yet again 
made a raid in the valley  14and david 
inquired again of god  and god said 
unto him  thou shalt not go up after 
them  turn away from them  and come 
upon them over against the mulberry 
trees  15and it shall be  when thou 
hearest the sound of marching in the 
tops of the mulberry trees that then 
thou shalt go out to battle  for god is 
gone out before thee to smite the host 
of the philistines  16and david did as 
god commanded him  and they smote 
the host of the philistines from gibeon 
even to gezer  17and the fame of 
david went out in to all lands  and the 
lord brought the fear of him upon all 
nations   
and david  made him houses 
in the city of david  and he 
prepared a place for the ark of god  
and pitched for it a tent  2then david 
                                                      
a that is the possessor of breaches  said none ought to carry the ark of 
god but the levites  for them hath the 
lord chosen to carry the ark of the 
lord and to minister unto him for 
ever 3and david assembled all israel 
at jerusalem  to bring up the ark of the 
lord unto its place  which he had 
prepared for it  4and david gathered 
togethe r the sons of aaron  and the 
levites  5of the sons of kohath  uriel 
the chief  and his brethren a hundred 
and twenty  6of the sons of merari  
asaiah the chief  and his brethren two 
hundred and twenty  7of the sons of 
gershom  joel the chief  and his 
brethr en a hundred and thirty  8of the 
sons of elizaphan  shemaiah the chief  
and his brethren two hundred  9of the 
sons of hebron  eliel the chief  and his 
brethren fourscore  10of the sons of 
uzziel  amminadab the chief  and his 
brethren a hundred and twelve  11and 
david called for zadok and abiathar 
the priests  and for the levites  for 
uriel  asaiah  and joel  shemaiah  and 
eliel  and amminadab  12and said unto 
them  ye are the heads of the 
fathers houses of the levites  sanctify 
yourselves  both ye and your  brethren  
that ye may bring up the ark of the 
lord the god of israel  unto the place 
that i have prepared for it  13for 
because ye bore it  not at the first  the 
lord our god made a breach upon us  
for that we sought him not according 
to the ordinance  14so the priests and 
the levites sanctified themselves to 
bring up the ark of the lord the god 
of israel  15and the children of the 15 first chronicles  
1282  
 levites bore the ark of god upon their 
shoulders with the bars thereon  as 
moses commanded according to the 
word of the lord  
16and david spoke to the chief of 
the levites to appoint their brethren 
the singers  with instruments of music  
psalteries and harps and cymbals  
sounding aloud and lifting up the voice 
with joy  17so the levites appointed 
heman the son of joel  and o f his 
brethren  asaph the son of berechiah  
and of the sons of merari their 
brethren  ethan the son of kushaiah  
18and with them their brethren of the 
second degree  zechariah  ben and

and unni  eliab  and benaiah  and 
maaseiah  and mattithiah  and 
eliphalehu  and mikneiah  and obed

the singers  heman  asaph  and ethan 
 were appointed  with cymbals of 
brass to sound aloud  20and zechariah  
and aziel  and shemiramoth  and 
jehiel  and unni  and eliab  and 
maaseiah  and benaiah  with psalteries 
set to alamoth  21and mattithiah  and 
eliphalehu  and mikneiahu  and obed 
edom  and jeiel  and azaziah  with 
harps on the sheminith  to lead  22and 
chenaniah  chief of the levites  was 
over the song  he was master in the 
song  because he was skilful  23and 
berechiah and elkanah were door 
keepers for the ark  24and shebaniah  
and joshaphat  and nethanel  and 
amasai  and zechariah  and benaiah  
and eliezer  the priests  did blow with the trumpe ts before the ark of god  
and obed edom and jehiah were 
doorkeepers for the ark   
25so david  and the elders of israel  
and the captains over thousands  went 
to bring up the ark of the covenant of 
the lord out of the house of obed 
edom with joy  26and it c ame to pass  
when god helped the levites that bore 
the ark of the covenant of the lord 
that they sacrificed seven bullocks and 
seven rams  27and david was clothed 
with a robe of fine linen  and all the 
levites that bore the ark  and the 
singers  and chena niah the master of 
the singers in the song  and david had 
upon him an ephod of linen  28thus all 
israel brought up the ark of the 
covenant of the lord with shouting  
and with sound of the horn  and with 
trumpets  and with cymbals  sounding 
aloud with psalt eries and harps  29and 
it came to pass  as the ark of the 
covenant of the lord came to the city 
of david  that michal the daughter of 
saul looked out at the window  and 
saw king david dancing and making 
merry  and she despised him in her 
heart   
and the y brought in the ark of 
god and set it in the midst of 
the tent that david had pitched for it  
and they offered burnt offerings and 
peace offerings before god  2and 
when david had made an end of 
offering the burnt offering and the 
peace offerings  he bles sed the people 
in the name of the lord 3and he dealt 
to every one of israel  both man and 16 first chronicles  
1283  
 woman  to every one a loaf of bread  
and a cake made in a pan  and a sweet 
cake  
4and he appointed certain of the

jeiel with psalteries and with harps  
and asa ph with cymbals  sounding 
aloud  6and benaiah and jahaziel the 
priests with trumpets continually  
before the ark of the covenant of god   
7then on that day did david first 
ordain to give thanks unto the lord by 
the hand of asaph and his brethren   
8o give  thanks unto the lord call

and his oath unto isaac   
17and he established it unto jacob 
for a statute   
to israel for an everlasting 
covenant   
18saying  unto thee will i give the 
land of canaan   
the lot of your inheritance   
 
19when ye were but a few men in 
number   
yea very few  and sojourners in it   
20and when they went about from 
nation to nation   
and from one kingdom to another 
people   
21he suffered no man to do them 
wrong   
yea for their sake he reproved 
kings

36blessed be the lord the god of

and all the people said  amen  and 
praised the lord  
37so he left there  before the ark of the 
covenant of the lord asaph and his 
brethren  to minister before the ark 
continually  as every  days work 
required  38and obed edom with their 
brethren  threescore and eight  obed 
edom also the son of jedithun and 
hosah to be door keepers  39and zadok 
the priest  and his brethren the priests  
before the tabernacle of the lord in 
the high place that  was at gibeon  40to 
offer burnt offerings unto the lord 
upon the altar of burnt offering 
continually morning and evening  even 
according to all that is written in the 
law of the lord which he 
commanded unto israel  41and with 
them heman and jeduthun  and the 
rest that were chosen  who were 
mentioned by name  to give thanks to 
the lord because his mercy endureth 
for ever  42and with them heman and 
jeduthun  to sound aloud with 
trumpets and cymbals  and with 
instruments for the songs of god  and first chronicles  
1285  
 the sons o f jeduthun to be at the gate  
43and all the people departed every 
man to his house  and david returned 
to bless his house   
and it came to pass  when 
david dwelt in his house  that 
david said to nathan the prophet  lo 
i dwell in a house of cedar  but the ark 
of the covenant of the lord dwelleth 
under curtains  2and nathan said unto 
david  do all that is in thy heart  for 
god is with thee  3and it came to pass 
the same night  that the word of god 
came to nathan  saying  4go and tell 
david my servant  thus saith the 
lord thou shalt not build me a house 
to dwell in  5for i have not dwelt in a 
house since the day that i brought up 
israel  unto this day  but have gone  
from tent to tent  and from one 
tabernacle to another  6in all places 
wherein i ha ve walked among all 
israel  spoke i a word with any of the 
judges of israel  whom i commanded 
to feed my people  saying  why have 
ye not built me a house of cedar  
7now therefore thus shalt thou say 
unto my servant david  thus saith the 
lord of hosts  i took thee from the 
sheepcote  from following the sheep  
that thou shouldest be prince over my 
people israel  8and i have been with 
thee whithersoever thou wentest  and 
have cut off all thine enemies from 
before thee  and i will make thee a 
name  like unto th e name of the great 
ones that are in the earth  9and i will 
appoint a place for my people israel  
and will plant them  that they may dwell in their own place  and be 
disquieted no more  neither shall the 
children of wickedness waste them any 
more  as at th e first  10even from the 
day that i commanded judges to be 
over my people israel  and i will 
subdue all thine enemies  moreover i 
tell thee that the lord will build thee a 
house  11and it shall come to pass  
when thy days are fulfilled that thou 
must go to  be with thy fathers  that i 
will set up thy seed after thee  who 
shall be of thy sons  and i will 
establish his kingdom  12he shall build 
me a house  and i will establish his 
throne for ever  13i will be to him for a 
father  and he shall be to me for a so n 
and i will not take my mercy away 
from him  as i took it from him that 
was before thee  14but i will settle him 
in my house and in my kingdom for 
ever and his throne shall be 
established for ever  15according to 
all these words  and according to all 
this vision  so did nathan speak unto 
david   
16then david the king went in  and 
sat before the lord and he said  who 
am i  o lord god and what is my 
house  that thou hast brought me thus 
far 17and this was a small thing in 
thine eyes  o god  but thou h ast 
spoken of thy servant s house for a 
great while to come  and hast regarded 
me after the manner of a man of high 
degree  o lord god 18what can 
david say yet more unto thee 
concerning the honour which is done 
to thy servant  for thou knowest thy 17 first chronicles  
1286  
 servant  19o lord for thy servant s 
sake and according to thine own 
heart  hast thou wrought all this 
greatness  to make known all these 
great things  20o lord there is none 
like thee  neither is there any god 
beside thee  according to all that we 
have heard w ith our ears  21and who is 
like thy people israel  a nation one in 
the earth  whom god went to redeem 
unto himself for a people  to make 
thee a name by great and tremendous 
things  in driving out nations from 
before thy people  whom thou didst 
redeem out o f egypt  22for thy people 
israel didst thou make thine own 
people for ever  and thou  lord 
becamest their god  23and now  o 
lord let the word that thou hast 
spoken concerning thy servant  and 
concerning his house  be established 
for ever  and do as thou hast spoken  
24yea let it be established  and let thy 
name be magnified for ever  that it 
may be said  the lord of hosts is the 
god of israel  even a god to israel  
and the house of david thy servant 
shall be established before thee  25for 
thou  o my god  hast revealed to thy 
servant that thou wilt build him a 
house  therefore hath thy servant 
taken heart to pray before thee  26and 
now o lord thou alone art god  and 
hast promised this good thing unto 
thy servant  27and now it hath pleased 
thee to bless t he house of thy servant  
that it may continue for ever before 
thee  for thou  o lord hast blessed  and so let thy servant  be blessed for 
ever  
and after this it came to pass  
that david smote the 
philistines  and subdued them  and 
took gath and its  towns out of the 
hand of the philistines   
2and he smote moab  and the 
moabites became servants to david  
and brought presents   
3and david smote hadarezer king 
of zobah by hamath  as he went to 
establish his dominion at the river 
euphrates  4and david to ok from him 
a thousand chariots  and seven 
thousand horsemen  and twenty 
thousand footmen  and david houghed 
all the chariot horses  but reserved of 
them for a hundred chariots  5and 
when the arameans of damascus 
came to succour hadarezer king of 
zobah  david smote of the arameans 
two and twenty thousand men  6then 
david put garrisons  in aram 
damascus  and the arameans became 
servants to david  and brought 
presents  and the lord gave victory to 
david whithersoever he went  7and 
david took the shields of g old that 
were on the servants of hadarezer  and 
brought them to jerusalem  8and from 
tibhath and from cun  cities of 
hadarezer  david took very much 
brass  wherewith solomon made the 
brazen sea  and the pillars  and the 
vessels of brass   
9and when tou kin g of hamath 
heard that david had smitten all the 
host of hadarezer king of zobah  10he 18 first chronicles  
1287  
 sent hadoram his son to king david  to 
salute him  and to bless him because 
he had fought against hadarezer and 
smitten him  for hadarezer had wars 
with tou and he had with him  all 
manner of vessels of gold and silver 
and brass  11these also did king david 
dedicate unto the lord with the silver 
and the gold that he carried away from 
all the nations  from edom  and from 
moab  and from the children of 
ammon  and from the  philistines  and 
from amalek  12moreover aabishai the 
son of zeruiah smote of the edomites 
in the valley of salt eighteen 
thousand  13and he put garrisons in 
edom  and all the edomites became 
servants to david  and the lord gave 
victory to david whitherso ever he 
went   
14and david reigned over all israel  
and he executed justice and 
righteousness unto all his people  
15and joab the son of zeruiah was 
over the host  and jehoshaphat the son 
of ahilud was recorder  16and zadok 
the son of ahitub  and abimelech  the 
son of abiathar  were priests  and 
shavsha was scribe  17and beniah the 
son of jehoiada was over the 
cherethites and the pelethites  and the 
sons of david were chief about the 
king  
and it came to pass after this  
that nahash the king of the 
child ren of ammon died  and his son 
reigned in his stead  2and david said  
                                                      
a heb abshai  and in xix 11 15  l will show kindness unto hanun the 
son of nahash  because his father 
showed kindness to me  so david 
sent messengers to comfort him 
concerning his father  and david s 
servants came in to the land of the 
children of ammon to hanun  to 
comfort him  3but the princes of the 
children of ammon said to hanun  
thinkest thou that david doth honour 
thy father  that he hath sent comforters 
unto thee  are not his servants come 
unto thee to search  and to overthrow  
and to spy out the land  4so hanun 
took david s servants  and shaved 
them  and cut off their garments in the 
middle  even to their hips  and sent 
them away  5then there went certain 
persons  and told david how the men 
were served  and h e sent to meet 
them  for the men were greatly 
ashamed  and the king said  tarry at 
jericho until your beards be grown  
and then return   
6and when the children of ammon 
saw that they had made themselves 
odious to david  hanun and the 
children of ammon se nt a thousand 
talents of silver to hire them chariots 
and horsemen out of aram naharaim  
and out of aram maacah  and out of 
zobah  7so they hired them thirty and 
two thousand chariots  and the king of 
maacah and his people  who came and 
encamped before med eba and the 
children of ammon gathered 
themselves together from their cities  
and came to battle  8and when david 
heard of it  he sent joab  and all the 19 first chronicles  
1288  
 host of the mighty men  9and the 
children of ammon came out and put 
the battle in array at the gate of  the 
city and the kings that were come 
were by themselves in the field   
10now when joab saw that the 
battle was set against him before and 
behind  he chose of all the choice men 
of israel  and put them in array against 
the arameans  11and the rest of the  
people he committed into the hand of 
abishai his brother  and they put 
themselves in array against the 
children of ammon  12and he said  if 
the arameans be too strong for me  
then thou shalt help me  but if the 
children of ammon be too strong for 
thee then i will help thee  13be of 
good courage  and let us prove strong 
for our people  and for the cities of our 
god and the lord do that which 
seemeth him good  14so joab and the 
people that were with him drew nigh 
unto the battle to meet the arameans  
and they fled before him  15and when 
the children of ammon saw that the 
arameans were fled  they likewise fled 
before abishai his brother  and entered 
into the city  then joab came to 
jerusalem   
16and when the arameans saw that 
they were put to the worse bef ore 
israel  they sent messengers  and 
brought out the arameans that were 
beyond the river  with shophach the 
captain of the host of hadarezer at 
their head  17and it was told david  
and he gathered all israel together  and 
passed over the jordan  and came upon them  and set the battle in array against 
them  so when david had put the 
battle in array against the arameans  
they fought with him  18and the 
arameans fled before israel  and 
david slew of the arameans the men 
of seven thousand chariots  and forty 
thousand footmen  and killed 
shophach the captain of the host  
19and when the servants of hadarezer 
saw that they were put to the worse 
before israel  they made peace with 
david  and served him  neither would 
the arameans help the children of 
ammon any more   
and it came to pass  at the 
time of the return of the year  
at the time when kings go out to battle  
that joab led forth the power of the 
army  and wasted the country of the 
children of ammon  and came and 
besieged rabbah  but david tarried at 
jerusa lem and joab smote rabbah  
and overthrew it  2and david took the 
crown of malcam from off his head  
and found it to weigh a talent of gold  
and there were precious stones in it  
and it was set upon david s head  and 
he brought forth the spoil of the city  
exceeding much  3and he brought 
forth the people that were therein  and 
cut them with saws  and with harrows 
of iron  and with axes  and thus did 
david unto all the cities of the children 
of ammon  and david and all the 
people returned to jerusalem   
4and it came to pass after this  that 
there arose war at gezer with the 
philistines  then sibbecai the 20 first chronicles  
1289  
 hushathite slew sippai  of the sons of 
the giants  and they were subdued  
5and there was again war with the 
philistines  and elhanan the son of jair 
slew lah mi the brother of goliath the 
gittite  the staff of whose spear was 
like a weaver s beam  6and there was 
again war at gath  where was a man of 
great stature  whose fingers and toes 
were four and twenty  six on each 
hand  and six on each foot  and he 
also was born unto the giant  7and 
when he taunted israel  jonathan the 
son of shimea david s brother slew 
him 8these were born unto the giant 
in gath  and they fell by the hand of 
david and by the hand of his servants   
and satan stood up against 
israel  and moved david to 
number israel  2and david said to 
joab and to the princes of the people  
go number israel from beersheba 
even to dan  and bring me word  that i 
may know the sum of them  3and 
joab said  the lord make his people 
a hundred times so m any more as they 
are but my lord the king  are they not 
all my lord s servants  why doth my 
lord require this thing  why will he be 
a cause of guilt unto israel  
4nevertheless the king s word 
prevailed against joab  wherefore 
joab departed and went thro ughout all 
israel  and came to jerusalem  5and 
joab gave up the sum of the 
numbering of the people unto david  
and all they of israel were a thousand 
thousand and a hundred thousand men 
that drew sword  and judah was four hundred three score and ten thousa nd 
men that drew sword  6but levi and 
benjamin he did not number among 
them  for the king s word was 
abominable to joab   
7and god was displeased with this 
thing  therefore he smote israel  8and 
david said unto god  i have sinned 
greatly  in that i have d one this thing  
but now  put away  i beseech thee  the 
iniquity of thy servant  for i have 
done very foolishly  9and the lord 
spoke unto gad  david s seer  saying  
10go and speak unto david  saying  
thus saith the lord i offer thee three 
things  choose thee one of them  that i 
may do it unto thee  11so gad came to 
david  and said unto him  thus saith 
the lord take which thou wilt  
12either three years of famine  or three 
months to be swept away before thy 
foes while the sword of thine enemies 
overtak eth thee  or else three days the 
sword of the lord even pestilence in 
the land  and the angel of the lord 
destroying throughout all the borders 
of israel  now therefore consider what 
answer i shall return to him that sent 
me 13and david said unto gad  i am 
in a great strait  let me fall now into 
the hand of the lord for very great are 
his mercies  and let me not fall into 
the hand of man   
14so the lord sent a pestilence 
upon israel  and there fell of israel 
seventy thousand men  15and god sent 
an ang el unto jerusalem to destroy it  
and as he was about to destroy  the 
lord beheld  and he repented him of 21 first chronicles  
1290  
 the evil  and said to the destroying 
angel  it is enough  now stay thy 
hand  and the angel of the lord was 
standing by the threshing floor of 
ornan t he jebusite  16and david lifted 
up his eyes  and saw the angel of the 
lord standing between the earth and 
the heaven  having a drawn sword in 
his hand stretched out over jerusalem  
then david and the elders  clothed in 
sackcloth  fell upon their faces  17and 
david said unto god  is it not i that 
commanded the people to be 
numbered  even i it is that have sinned 
and done very wickedly  but these 
sheep  what have they done  let thy 
hand  i pray thee  o lord my god  be 
against me  and against my father s 
hous e but not against thy people  that 
they should be plagued   
18then the angel of the lord 
commanded gad to say to david  that 
david should go up  and rear an altar 
unto the lord in the threshing floor of 
ornan the jebusite  19and david went 
up at the sayi ng of gad  which he 
spoke in the name of the lord 20and 
ornan turned back  and saw the angel  
and his four sons that were with him 
hid themselves  now ornan was 
threshing wheat  21and as david came 
to ornan  ornan looked and saw 
david  and went out of the  threshing 
floor  and bowed down to david with 
his face to the ground  22then david 
said to ornan  give me the place of 
this threshing floor  that i may build 
thereon an altar unto the lord for the 
full price shalt thou give it me  that the plague may be  stayed from the 
people  23and ornan said unto david  
take it to thee  and let my lord the 
king do that which is good in his eyes  
lo i give thee the oxen for burnt 
offerings  and the threshing 
instruments for wood  and the wheat 
for the meal offering  i give it 
all24and king david said to ornan  
nay but i will verily buy it for the 
full price  for i will not take that which 
is thine for the lord nor offer a burnt 
offering without cost  25so david 
gave to ornan for the place six 
hundred shekels of g old by weight  
26and david built there an altar unto 
the lord and offered burnt offerings 
and peace offerings  and called upon 
the lord and he answered him from 
heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt 
offering  27and the lord commanded 
the angel  and he p ut up his sword 
back into the sheath thereof   
28at that time  when david saw that 
the lord had answered him in the 
threshing floor of ornan the jebusite  
then he sacrificed there  29for the 
tabernacle of the lord which moses 
made in the wilderness  and t he altar 
of burnt offering  were at that time in 
the high place at gibeon  30but david 
could not go before it to inquire of 
god for he was terrified because of 
the sword of the angel of the lord  
then david  said this is the 
house of the lord god and 
this is the altar of burnt offering for 
israel   22 first chronicles  
1291  
 2and david commanded to gather 
together the strangers that were in the 
land of israel  and he set masons to 
hew wrought stones to build the house 
of god  3and david prepared iron in 
abundance for the nail s for the doors 
of the gates  and for the couplings  and 
brass in abundance without weight  
4and cedar trees without number  for 
the zidonians and they of tyre 
brought cedar trees in abundance to 
david  5and david said  solomon my 
son is young and tender  and the house 
that is to be builded for the lord must 
be exceeding magnificent  of fame and 
of glory throughout all countries  i will 
therefore make preparation for him  
so david prepared abundantly before 
his death   
6then he called for solomon his 
son and charged him to build a house 
for the lord the god of israel  7and 
david said to solomon  my son  as 
for me  it was in my heart to build a 
house unto the name of the lord my 
god 8but the word of the lord came 
to me  saying  thou hast shed blood 
abun dantly  and hast made great wars  
thou shalt not build a house unto my 
name  because thou hast shed much 
blood upon the earth in my sight  
9behold  a son shall be born to thee  
who shall be a man of rest  and i will 
give him rest from all his enemies 
round  about  for his name shall be 
asolomon  and i will give peace and 
quietness unto israel in his days  10he 
                                                      
a that is peaceful  shall build a house for my name  and 
he shall be to me for a son  and i will 
be to him for a father  and i will 
establish the throne of his kingdom 
over israel for ever  11now  my son  
the lord be with thee  and prosper 
thou and build the house of the lord 
thy god  as he hath spoken 
concerning thee  12only the lord give 
thee discretion and understanding  and 
give thee charge concerning israel  
that so thou mayest keep the law of the 
lord thy god  13then shalt thou 
prosper  if thou observe to do the 
statutes and the ordinances which the 
lord charged moses with concerning 
israel  be strong  and of good courage  
fear not  neither be dismayed  14now  
behold  in my straits i have prepared 
for the house of the lord a hundred 
thousand talents of gold  and a 
thousand thousand talents of silver  
and of brass and iron without weight  
for it is in abundance  timber also and 
stone have i prepared  and thou mayest 
add thereto  15moreover there are 
workmen with thee in abundance  
hewers and workers of stone and 
timber  and all men that are skilful in 
any manner of work  16of the gold  the 
silver  and the brass  and the iron  
there is no number  arise and be 
doing  and the lord be with thee   
17david also commanded all the 
princes of israel to help solomon his 
son 18is not the lord your god with 
you and hath he not given you rest 
on every side  for he hath delivered 
the inhabitants of the land into my first chronicles  
1292  
 hand  and the l and is subdued before 
the lord and before his people  
19now set your heart and your soul to 
seek after the lord your god  arise 
therefore  and build ye the sanctuary of 
the lord god to bring the ark of the 
covenant of the lord and the holy 
vessels of go d into the house that is to 
be built to the name of the lord  
now david was old and full of 
days and he made solomon 
his son king over israel  2and he 
gathered together all the princes of 
israel  with the priests and the levites  
3and the levites we re numbered from 
thirty years old and upward  and their 
number by their polls  man by man  
was thirty and eight thousand  4of 
these  twenty and four thousand were 
to oversee the work of the house of the 
lord and six thousand were officers 
and judges  5and four thousand were 
doorkeepers  and four thousand 
praised the lord with the instruments 
which i made to praise therewith   
6and david divided them into 
courses according to the sons of levi  
gershon  kohath  and merari  7of the 
gershonites  ladan  and s himei  8the 
sons of ladan  jehiel the chief  and 
zetham  and joel  three  9the sons of 
shimei  shelomith  and haziel  and 
haran  three  these were the heads of 
the fathers houses of ladan  10and the 
sons of shimei  jahath  zina and 
jeush  and beriah  thes e four were the 
sons of shimei  11and jahath was the 
chief  and zizah the second  but jeush 
and beriah had not many sons  therefore they became a fathers house 
in one reckoning   
12the sons of kohath  amram  
izhar  hebron  and uzziel  four 13the 
sons of a mram  aaron and moses  
and aaron was separated  that he 
should be sanctified as most holy  he 
and his sons for ever  to offer before 
the lord to minister unto him  and to 
bless in his name for ever  14but as for 
moses the man of god  his sons are 
named am ong the tribe of levi  15the 
sons of moses  gershom  and eliezer  
16the sons of gershom  shebuel the 
chief  17and the sons of eliezer were  
rehabiah the chief  and eliezer had 
no other sons  but the sons of 
rehabiah were very many  18the sons

of uzziel  micah the chief  and isshiah 
the second   
21the sons of merari  mahli  and 
mushi  the sons of mahli  eleazar

no sons  but daughters only  and their 
brethren the sons of kish took them to 
wife 23the sons of mushi  mahli  and 
eder  and jeremoth  three   
24these were the sons of levi after 
their fathers houses  even the heads of  
the fathers houses  according to their 
muster  in the number of names by 
their polls  who did the work for the 
service of the house of the lord from 
twenty years old and upward  25for 
david said  the lord the god of 23 first chronicles  
1293  
 israel  hath given rest unto his peo ple 
and he dwelleth in jerusalem for ever  
26and also the levites shall no more 
have need to carry the tabernacle and 
all the vessels of it for the service 
thereof  27for by the last ordinances 
of david the sons of levi were 
numbered from twenty years ol d and 
upward  28for their station was at the 
side of the sons of aaron for the 
service of the house of the lord in the 
courts  and in the chambers  and in the 
purifying of all holy things  even the 
work of the service of the house of 
god 29for the showbr ead also  and for 
the fine flour for a meal offering  
whether of unleavened wafers  or of 
that which is baked on the griddle  or 
of that which is soaked  and for all 
manner of measure and size  30and to

31and to offer all burnt offerings unto

in number according to the ordinance 
concerning them  continually  before 
the lord 32and that they should keep 
the charge  of the tent of meeting  and 
the charge of the holy place  and the 
charge of the sons of aaron their 
brethren  for the service of the house 
of the lord  
and the courses of the sons of 
aaron were these  the sons of 
aaron  nadab and abihu  eleazar and 
ithamar  2but nadab and abihu died 
before their father  and had no 
children  therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priest s office  
3and david with zadok of the sons of 
eleazar  and ahimelech of the sons of 
ithamar  divided them according to 
their order ing in their service  4and 
there were more chief men found of 
the sons of eleazar than of the sons of 
ithamar  and thus were they divided  
of the sons of eleazar there were 
sixteen  heads of fathers houses  and 
of the sons of ithamar  according to 
their fa thers houses  eight  5thus were 
they divided by lot  one sort with 
another  for they were princes of the 
sanctuary and princes of god  both of 
the sons of eleazar  and of the sons of 
ithamar  6and shemaiah the son of 
nethanel the scribe  who was of the 
levites wrote them in the presence of 
the king  and the princes  and zadok

 jerusalem  2then david the king stood 
up upon his feet  and said  hear  me 
my brethren  and my people  as for 
me it was in my heart to build a house 
of rest for the ark of the covenant of 
the lord and for the footstool of our 
god and i had made ready for the 
building  3but god said unto me  thou 
shalt not build a house fo r my name  
because thou art a man of war  and 
hast shed blood  4howbeit the lord 
the god of israel  chose me out of all 
the house of my father to be king over 
israel for ever  for he hath chosen 
judah to be prince  and in the house of 
judah  the house of my father  and 
among the sons of my father he took 
pleasure in me to make me king over 
all israel  5and of all my sons for the 
lord hath given me many sons he 
hath chosen solomon my son to sit 
upon the throne of the kingdom of the 
lord over israel  6and he  said unto 
me solomon thy son  he shall build 
my house and my courts  for i have 
chosen him to be to me for a son  and i 
will be to him for a father  7and i will 
establish his kingdom for ever  if he be 
constant to do my commandments and 
mine ordinances  as at this day  8now 
therefore  in the sight of all israel  the 
congregation of the lord and in the 
hearing of our god  observe and seek 
out all the commandments of the lord 
your god  that ye may possess this 
good land  and leave it for an 
inheritance to your children after you 
for ever   9and thou  solomon my son  know 
thou the god of thy father  and serve 
him with a whole heart and with a 
willing mind  for the lord searcheth 
all hearts  and understandeth all the 
imaginations of the thoughts  if thou 
seek him he will be found of thee  
but if thou forsake him  he will cast 
thee off for ever  10take heed now  for 
the lord hath chosen thee to build a 
house for the sanctuary  be strong  and 
do it

for the lord god even my god  is 
with thee  he will not fail thee  nor 
forsake thee  until all the work for the

and there shall be with thee i n all 
manner of work every willing man that 
hath skill  for any manner of service  
also the captains and all the people 
will be wholly at thy commandment   
and david the king said unto 
all the congregation  solomon 
my son  whom alone god hath chosen  
is yet young and tender  and the work 
is great  for the palace is not for man  
but for the lord god 2now i have 
prepared with all my might for the house of my god the gold for the

have set my affection on the house of

of mine own of gold and silver  i give 
it unto the house of my god  over and 
above all that i have prepared for the 
holy house  4even three thousand 
talents of gold  of the gold o f ophir

silver  wherewith to overlay the walls

made by the hands of artificers  who 
then offeret h willingly to consecrate

6then the princes of the 
fathers houses  and the princes of the 
tribes of israel  and the captains of 
thousands and of hundreds  with the 
rulers over the king s work  offered 
willingly  7and they gave for the 
service of the house of god of gold 
five thousand talents and ten thousand

treasure of the house of the lord 29 first chronicles  
1301  
 under the hand of jehiel the 
gershonite  9then the people rejoiced  
for that they offered willingly  because 
with a whole heart they offered 
willingly to the lord and david the 
king also rejoiced with  great joy   
10wherefore david blessed the 
lord before all the congregation  and 
david said  blessed be thou  o lord 
the god of israel our father  for ever 
and ever  11thine  o lord is the 
greatness  and the power  and the 
glory  and the victory  and th e majesty  
for all that is in the heaven and in the 
earth is thine  thine is the kingdom  
o lord and thou art exalted as head 
above all  12both riches and honour 
come of thee  and thou rulest over 
all and in thy hand is power and 
might  and in thy hand i t is to make 
great  and to give strength unto all  
13now therefore  our god  we thank 
thee  and praise thy glorious name  
14but who am i  and what is my 
people  that we should be able to offer 
so willingly after this sort  for all 
things come of thee  and of thine 
own have we given thee  15for we are 
strangers before thee  and sojourners  
as all our fathers were  our days on the 
earth are as a shadow  and there is no 
abiding  16o lord our god  all this 
store that we have prepared to build 
thee a house for t hy holy name 
cometh of thy hand  and is all thine 
own 17i know also  my god  that thou 
triest the heart  and hast pleasure in 
uprightness  as for me  in the 
uprightness of my heart i have willingly offered all these things  and 
now have i seen with joy th y people  
that are present here  offer willingly 
unto thee  18o lord the god of 
abraham  of isaac  and of israel  our 
fathers  keep this for ever  even the 
imagination of the thoughts of the 
heart of thy people  and direct their 
heart unto thee  19and giv e unto 
solomon my son a whole heart  to 
keep thy commandments  thy 
testimonies  and thy statutes  and to 
do all these things  and to build the 
palace  for which i have made  
provision   
20and david said to all the 
congregation  now bless the lord 
your go d and all the congregation 
blessed the lord the god of their 
fathers  and bowed down their heads  
and prostrated themselves before the 
lord and before the king  21and they 
sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and 
offered burnt offerings unto the lord 
on the morrow after that day  even a 
thousand bullocks  a thousand rams  
and a thousand lambs  with their drink 
offerings  and sacrifices in abundance 
for all israel  22and did eat and drink 
before the lord on that day with great 
gladness  and they made so lomon the 
son of david king the second time  and 
anointed him unto the lord to be 
prince  and zadok to be priest  23then 
solomon sat on the throne of the lord 
as king instead of david his father  and 
prospered  and all israel hearkened to 
him 24and all th e princes  and the 
mighty men  and all the sons likewise first chronicles  
1302  
 of king david  submitted themselves 
unto solomon the king  25and the 
lord magnified solomon exceedingly 
in the sight of all israel  and bestowed 
upon him such royal majesty as had 
not been on any kin g before him in 
israel   
26now david the son of jesse 
reigned over all israel  27and the time 
that he reigned over israel was forty 
years  seven years reigned he in 
hebron  and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem  28and he died 
in a good old age  full of days  riches  
and honour  and solomon his son 
reigned in his stead  29now the acts of 
david the king  first and last  behold  
they are written in the words of 
samuel the seer  and in the words of 
nathan the prophet  and in the words 
of gad the se er 30with all his reign and 
his might  and the times that went over 
him and over israel  and over all the 
kingdoms of the countries   
 
 
 
  
1303  
     
second chronicles  
 
and solomon  the son of david 
was strengthened in his kingdom  
and the lord his god was with him  
and magnified him exceedingly  2and 
solomon spoke unto all israel  to the 
captains of thousands and of hundreds  
and to the judges  and to every prince 
in all israel  the heads of the 
fathers houses  3so solomon  and all 
the congregation with him  went to the 
high place that was at gibeon  for 
there was the tent of meeting of god  
which moses the servant of the lord 
had made in  the wilderness  4but the 
ark of god had david brought up from 
kiriath jearim to the place that david 
had prepared for it  for he had pitched 
a tent for it at jerusalem  5moreover 
the brazen altar  that bezalel the son of 
uri the son of hur  had made  had 
been put before the tabernacle of the 
lord and solomon and the 
congregation sought unto it  6and 
solomon offered there  upon the 
brazen altar before the lord which 
was at the tent of meeting  he offered a 
thousand burnt offerings upon it   
7in that nigh t did god  appear unto 
solomon  and said unto him  ask 
what i shall give thee  8and solomon 
said unto god  thou hast shown great 
kindness unto david my father  and 
hast made me king in his stead  9now  
o lord god let thy promise unto 
david my father be  established  for thou hast made me king over a people 
like the dust of the earth in multitude  
10give me now wisdom and 
knowledge  that i may go out and 
come in before this people  for who 
can judge this thy people  that is so 
great  11and god said to so lomon  
because this was in thy heart  and 
thou hast not asked riches  wealth  or 
honour  nor the life of them that hate 
thee neither yet hast asked long life  
but hast asked wisdom and knowledge 
for thyself  that thou mayest judge my 
people  over whom i have made thee 
king 12wisdom and knowledge is 
granted unto thee  and i will give thee 
riches  and wealth  and honour  such as 
none of the kings have had that have 
been before thee  neither shall there 
any after thee have the like  13so 
solomon came from  his journey  to 
the high place that was at gibeon  
from before the tent of meeting  unto 
jerusalem  and he reigned over israel   
14and solomon gathered chariots 
and horsemen  and he had a thousand 
and four hundred chariots  and twelve 
thousand horsemen  that he placed in 
the chariot cities  and with the king at 
jerusalem  15and the king made silver 
and gold to be in jerusalem as stones  
and cedars made he to be as the 
sycamore trees that are in the 
lowland  for abundance  16and the 
horses which solomon had  were 1 second chronicles  
1304  
 brought out of egypt  also out of 
keve  the king s merchants buying 
them of the men of keve at a price  
17and they fetched up  and brought out 
of egypt a chariot for six hundred 
shekels of silver  and a horse for a 
hundred and fifty  and so for all t he 
kings of the hittites  and the kings of 
aram  did they bring them out by their 
means   
18now solomon purposed to build a 
house for the name of the lord and a  
house for his kingdom   1and 
solomon counted out threescore 
and ten thousand men to bear bu rdens  
and fourscore thousand men that were 
hewers in the mountains  and three 
thousand and six hundred to oversee 
them   2and solomon sent to huram 
the king of tyre  saying  as thou 
didst deal with david my father  and 
didst send him cedars to build him a 
house to dwell therein  even so deal 
with me   3behold  i am about to build 
a house for the name of the lord my 
god to dedicate it to him  and to burn 
before him incense of sweet spices  
and for the continual showbread  and 
for the burnt offerings mo rning and 
evening  on the sabbaths  and on the 
new moons  and on the appointed 
seasons of the lord our god  this is 
an ordinance for ever to israel   4and 
the house which i build is great  for 
great is our god above all gods   5but 
who is able to build him  a house  
seeing the heaven and the heaven of 
heavens cannot contain him  who am 
i then  that i should build him a house  save only to offer before him   6now 
therefore send me a man skilful to 
work in gold  and in silver  and in 
brass  and in iron  and in  purple  and 
crimson  and blue  and that hath skill 
to grave all manner of gravings  to be 
with the skilful men that are with me 
in judah and in jerusalem  whom 
david my father did provide   7send 
me also cedar trees  cypress trees  and 
sandal wood  out of  lebanon  for i 
know that thy servants have skill to cut 
timber in lebanon  and behold  my 
servants shall be with thy servants   
8even to prepare me timber in 
abundance  for the house which i am 
about to build shall be great and 
wonderful  9and behold  i will give to 
thy servants  the hewers that cut 
timber  twenty thousand measures of 
beaten wheat  and twenty thousand 
measures of barley  and twenty 
thousand baths of wine  and twenty 
thousand baths of oil   
10then huram the king of tyre 
answered in writi ng which he sent to 
solomon  because the lord loveth 
his people  he hath made thee king 
over them  11huram said moreover  
blessed be the lord the god of 
israel  that made heaven and earth  
who hath given to david the king a 
wise son  endued with discr etion and 
understanding  that should build a 
house for the lord and a house for his 
kingdom  12and now i have sent a 
skilful man  endued with 
understanding  even huram my master 
craftsman  13the son of a woman of the 2 second chronicles  
1305  
 daughters of dan  and his father was a  
man of tyre  skilful to work in gold  
and in silver  in brass  in iron  in stone

fine linen  and in crimson  also to 
grave any manner of graving  and to 
devise any device  to do whatever may 
be set before him  with thy skilful 
men and with the skilful men of my 
lord david thy father  14now therefore 
the wheat and the barley  the oil and 
the wine  which my lord hath spoken 
of let him send unto his servants  
15and we will cut wood out of 
lebanon  as much as thou s halt need  
and we will bring it to thee in floats by 
sea to joppa  and thou shalt carry it up 
to jerusalem   
16and solomon numbered all the 
strangers that were in the land of 
israel  after the numbering wherewith 
david his father had numbered them  
and th ey were found a hundred and 
fifty thousand and three thousand and 
six hundred  17and he set threescore 
and ten thousand of them to bear 
burdens  and fourscore thousand to be 
hewers in the mountains  and three 
thousand and six hundred overseers to 
set the p eople at work   
then solomon began to build the 
house of the lord at jerusalem in 
mount moriah  where the lord  
appeared unto david his father  for 
which provision had been made in the 
place of david  in the threshingfloor of 
ornan the jebusite  2and he  began to 
build in the second day of the second 
month  in the fourth year of his reign  3now these are the foundations which 
solomon laid for the building of the 
house of god  the length by cubits 
after the ancient measure was 
threescore cubits  and the br eadth 
twenty cubits  4and the porch that was 
before the house  the length of it  
according to the breadth of the house  
was twenty cubits  and the height a 
hundred and twenty  and he overlaid it 
within with pure gold  5and the greater 
house he covered wi th cypress wood  
which he overlaid with fine gold  and 
wrought thereon palm trees and 
chains  6and he garnished the house 
with precious stones for beauty  and 
the gold was gold of parvaim  7he 
overlaid also the house  the beams  the 
thresholds  and the wal ls thereof  and 
the doors thereof  with gold  and 
graved cherubim on the walls   
8and he made the most holy place  
the length thereof  according to the 
breadth of the house  was twenty 
cubits  and the breadth thereof twenty 
cubits  and he overlaid it with fine 
gold amounting to six hundred talents  
9and the weight of the nails was fifty 
shekels of gold  and he overlaid the 
upper chambers with gold   
10and in the most holy place he 
made two cherubim of image work  
and they overlaid them with gold  
11and the  wings of the cherubim were 
twenty cubits long  the wing of the one 
cherub was five cubits  reaching to the 
wall of the house  and the other wing 
was likewise five cubits  reaching to 
the wing of the other cherub  12and the 3 second chronicles  
1306  
 wing of the other cherub was fiv e 
cubits  reaching to the wall of the 
house  and the other wing was five 
cubits also  joining to the wing of the 
other cherub  13the wings of these 
cherubim spread themselves forth 
twenty cubits  and they stood on their 
feet and their faces were inward   
14and he made the veil of blue  and 
purple  and crimson  and fine linen  
and wrought cherubim thereon   
15also he made before the house 
two pillars of thirty and five cubits 
high and the capital that was on the 
top of each of them was five cubits   
16and he made chains in the 
sanctuary  and put them on the tops of 
the pillars  and he made a hundred 
pomegranates  and put them on the 
chains  17and he set up the pillars 
before the temple  one on the right 
hand  and the other on the left  and 
called the name o f that on the right 
hand jachin  and the name of that on 
the left boaz   
moreover he made an altar of 
brass  twenty cubits the length 
thereof  and twenty cubits the breadth 
thereof  and ten cubits the height 
thereof   
2also he made the molten sea of ten 
cubits from brim to brim  round in 
compass  and the height thereof was 
five cubits  and a line of thirty cubits 
did compass it round about  3and 
under it was the similitude of oxen  
which did compass it round about  for 
ten cubits  compassing the sea round  
about  the oxen were in two rows  cast when it was cast  4it stood upon twelve 
oxen  three looking toward the north  
and three looking toward the west  and 
three looking toward the south  and 
three looking toward the east  and the 
sea was set upon them ab ove and all 
their hinder parts were inward  5and it 
was a handbreadth thick  and the brim 
thereof was wrought like the brim of a 
cup like the flower of a lily  it 
received and held three thousand 
baths   
6he made also ten lavers  and put 
five on the righ t hand  and five on the 
left to wash in them  such things as 
belonged to the burnt offering they 
washed in them  but the sea was for 
the priests to wash in   
7and he made the ten candlesticks 
of gold according to the ordinance 
concerning them  and he set them in 
the temple  five on the right hand  and 
five on the left   
8he made also ten tables  and placed 
them in the temple  five on the right 
side and five on the left  and he made 
a hundred basins of gold   
9furthermore he made the court of 
the priests  and the great court  and 
doors for the court  and overlaid the 
doors of them with brass   
10and he set the sea on the right side 
of the house  eastward  toward the 
south   
11and huram made the pots  and the 
shovels  and the basins  so huram 
made an end of  doing the work that he 
wrought for king solomon in the 
house of god  12the two pillars  and the 4 second chronicles  
1307  
 bowls  and the two capitals which 
were on the top of the pillars  and the 
two networks to cover the two bowls 
of the capitals that were on the top of 
the pilla rs 13and the four hundred 
pomegranates for the two networks  
two rows of pomegranates for each 
network  to cover the two bowls of the 
capitals that were upon the top of the 
pillars  14he made also the bases  and 
the lavers made he upon the bases  
15one se a and the twelve oxen under 
it 16the pots also  and the shovels  and 
the flesh hooks  and all the vessels 
thereof  did huram his master 
craftsman make for king solomon for 
the house of the lord of bright brass  
17in the plain of the jordan did the king 
cast them  in the clay ground between 
succoth and zeredah  18thus solomon 
made all these vessels in great 
abundance  for the weight of the brass 
could not be found out   
19and solomon made all the vessels 
that were in the house of god  the 
golden altar also  and the tables 
whereon was the showbread  20and the 
candlesticks with their lamps  that they 
should burn according to the ordinance 
before the sanctuary  of pure gold  
21and the flowers  and the lamps  and 
the tongs  of gold  and that perfect 
gold 22and the snuffers  and the 
basins  and the pans  and the fire pans 
of pure gold  and as for the entry of 
the house  the inner doors thereof for 
the most holy place  and the doors of 
the house  that is  of the temple  were 
of gold   thus all the work that so lomon 
wrought for the house of the lord 
was finished  and solomon brought in 
the things that david his father had 
hallowed  even the silver  and the 
gold and all the vessels  and put them 
in the treasuries of the house of god   
2then solomon assembled the  
elders of israel  and all the heads of the 
tribes  the princes of the fathers houses 
of the children of israel  unto 
jerusalem  to bring up the ark of the 
covenant of the lord out of the city of 
david  which is zion  3and all the men 
of israel assembled t hemselves unto 
the king at the feast  which was in the 
seventh month  4and all the elders of 
israel came  and the levites took up 
the ark  5and they brought up the ark  
and the tent of meeting  and all the 
holy vessels that were in the tent  
these did the priests and the levites 
bring up  6and king solomon and all 
the congregation of israel  that were 
assembled unto him  were before the 
ark sacrificing sheep and oxen  that 
could not be counted nor numbered for 
multitude  7and the priests brought in 
the ark  of the covenant of the lord 
unto its place  into the sanctuary of the 
house  to the most holy place  even 
under the wings of the cherubim  8for 
the cherubim spread forth their wings 
over the place of the ark  and the 
cherubim covered the ark and the 
stave s thereof above  9and the staves 
were so long that the ends of the staves 
were seen from the ark before the 
sanctuary  but they could not be seen 5 second chronicles  
1308  
 without  and there they are unto this 
day 10there was nothing in the ark 
save the two tables which moses put 
there at horeb  when the lord made a 
covenant with the children of israel  
when they came out of egypt   
11and it came to pass  when the 
priests were come out of the holy 
place for all the priests that were 
present had sanctified themselves  and 
did not ke ep their courses  12also the 
levites who were the singers  all of 
them  even asaph  heman  jeduthun  
and their sons and their brethren  
arrayed in fine linen  with cymbals and 
psalteries and harps  stood at the east 
end of the altar  and with them a 
hundre d and twenty priests sounding 
with trumpets 13it came even to pass  
when the trumpeters and singers were 
as one  to make one sound to be heard 
in praising and thanking the lord and 
when they lifted up their voice with 
the trumpets and cymbals and 
instrume nts of music  and praised the 
lord for he is good  for his mercy 
endureth for ever  that then the house 
was filled with a cloud  even the house 
of the lord 14so that the priests could 
not stand to minister by reason of the 
cloud  for the glory of the lord filled 
the house of god   
then spoke solomon   
the lord  hath said that he 
would  dwell in the thick 
darkness   
2but i have built thee a house of 
habitation   and a place for thee to dwell in for 
ever  
3and the king turned his face  and 
blessed all t he congregation of israel  
and all the congregation of israel 
stood  4and he said  blessed be the 
lord the god of israel  who spoke 
with his mouth unto david my father  
and hath with his hands fulfilled it  
saying  5since the day that i brought 
forth my people out of the land of 
egypt  i chose no city out of all the 
tribes of israel to build a house in  that 
my name might be there  neither chose 
i any man to be prince over my people 
israel  6but i have chosen jerusalem  
that my name might be there  and ha ve 
chosen david to be over my people 
israel  7now it was in the heart of 
david my father to build a house for 
the name of the lord the god of 
israel  8but the lord said unto david 
my father  whereas it was in thy heart 
to build a house for my name  thou 
didst well that it was in thy heart  
9nevertheless thou shalt not build the 
house  but thy son that shall come 
forth out of thy loins  he shall build the 
house for my name  10and the lord 
hath established his word that he 
spoke  for i am risen up in the roo m of 
david my father  and sit on the throne 
of israel  as the lord promised  and 
have built the house for the name of 
the lord the god of israel  11and 
there have i set the ark  wherein is the 
covenant of the lord which he made 
with the children of israe l  6 second chronicles  
1309  
 12and he stood before the altar of 
the lord in the presence of all the 
congregation of israel  and spread 
forth his hands 13for solomon had 
made a brazen scaffold  of five cubits 
long and five cubits broad  and three 
cubits high  and had set it in th e midst 
of the court  and upon it he stood  and 
kneeled down upon his knees before 
all the congregation of israel  and 
spread forth his hands toward 
heaven 14and he said  o lord the 
god of israel  there is no god like 
thee  in the heaven  or in the earth  
who keepest covenant and mercy with 
thy servants  that walk before thee 
with all their heart  15who hast kept 
with thy servant david my father that 
which thou didst promise him  yea 
thou spokest with thy mouth  and 
hast fulfilled it with thy hand  as it is 
this day  16now therefore  o lord the 
god of israel  keep with thy servant 
david my father that which thou hast 
promised him  saying  there shall not 
fail thee a man in my sight to sit on 
the throne of israel  if only thy 
children take heed to their w ay to 
walk in my law as thou hast walked 
before me  17now therefore  o lord 
the god of israel  let thy word be 
verified  which thou spokest unto thy 
servant david   
18but will god in very truth dwell 
with men on the earth  behold  heaven 
and the heaven o f heavens cannot 
contain thee  how much less this 
house which i have builded  19yet 
have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant  and to his supplication  o 
lord my god  to hearken unto the cry 
and to the prayer which thy servant 
prayeth before thee  20that thine eyes 
may be open toward this house day 
and night  even toward the place 
whereof thou hast said that thou 
wouldest put thy name there  to 
hearken unto the prayer which thy 
servant shall pray toward this place  
21and hearken thou to the 
supplicat ions of thy servant  and of 
thy people israel  when they shall 
pray toward this place  yea hear thou 
from thy dwelling place  even from 
heaven  and when thou hearest  
forgive   
22if a man sin against his neighbour  
and an oath be exacted of him to cause 
him to swear  and he come and swear 
before thine altar in this house  23then 
hear thou from heaven  and do  and 
judge thy servants  requiting the 
wicked  to bring his way upon his own 
head  and justifying the righteous  to 
give him according to his 
righteou sness   
24and if thy people israel be 
smitten down before the enemy  when 
they sin against thee  and shall turn 
again and confess thy name  and pray 
and make supplication before thee in 
this house  25then hear thou from 
heaven  and forgive the sin of thy 
people israel  and bring them back 
unto the land which thou gavest to 
them and to their fathers   
26when the heaven is shut up  and 
there is no rain  when they sin against second chronicles  
1310  
 thee  if they pray toward this place  
and confess thy name  turning from 
their sin  when thou dost afflict them  
27then hear thou in heaven  and 
forgive the sin of thy servants  and of 
thy people israel  when thou dost 
direct them on the good way wherein 
they should walk  and send rain upon 
thy land  which thou hast given to 
thy people for  an inheritance   
28if there be in the land famine  if 
there be pestilence  if there be blasting 
or mildew  locust or caterpillar  if their 
enemies besiege them in the land of 
their cities  whatsoever plague or 
whatsoever sickness there be  29what 
prayer a nd supplication soever be 
made by any man  or by all thy people 
israel  who shall know every man his 
own plague and his own pain  and 
shall spread forth his hands toward this 
house  30then hear thou from heaven 
thy dwelling place  and forgive  and 
render u nto every man according to all 
his ways  whose heart thou 
knowest for thou  even thou only  
knowest the hearts of the children of 
men31that they may fear thee  to 
walk in thy ways  all the days that 
they live in the land which thou 
gavest unto our fathers   
32moreover concerning the stranger  
that is not of thy people israel  when 
be shall come out of a far country for 
thy great name s sake  and thy 
mighty hand  and thine outstretched 
arm when they shall come and pray 
toward this house  33then hear thou 
from heaven  even from thy dwelling place  and do according to all that the 
stranger calleth to thee for  that all the 
peoples of the earth may know thy 
name  and fear thee  as doth thy 
people israel  and that they may know 
that thy name is called upon this  
house which i have built   
34if thy people go out to battle 
against their enemies  by whatsoever 
way thou shalt send them  and they 
pray unto thee toward this city which 
thou hast chosen  and the house which 
i have built for thy name  35then hear 
thou fro m heaven their prayer and 
their supplication  and maintain their 
cause  36if they sin against thee for 
there is no man that sinneth not and 
thou be angry with them  and deliver 
them to the enemy  so that they carry 
them away captive unto a land far off 
or near 37yet if they shall bethink 
themselves in the land whither they are 
carried captive  and turn  and make 
supplication unto thee in the land of 
their captivity  saying  we have 
sinned  we have done iniquitously  and 
have dealt wickedly  38if they retur n 
unto thee with all their heart and with 
all their soul in the land of their 
captivity  whither they have carried 
them captive  and pray toward their 
land which thou gavest unto their 
fathers  and the city which thou hast 
chosen  and toward the house whi ch i 
have built for thy name  39then hear 
thou from heaven  even from thy 
dwelling place  their prayer and their 
supplications  and maintain their second chronicles  
1311  
 cause  and forgive thy people who 
have sinned against thee   
40now  o my god  let i beseech 
thee  thine eyes  be open  and let 
thine ears be attent  unto the prayer 
that is made in this place   
41now therefore arise  o lord  god 
into thy resting place   
thou  and the ark of thy strength   
let thy priests  o lord god be 
clothed with salvation   
and let thy saints  rejoice in good   
42o lord god turn not away the 
face of thine anointed   
remember the good deeds of david 
thy servant   
 
now when solomon had made an 
end of praying  the fire came 
down from heaven  and consumed the 
burnt offering and the sacrifices  and 
the glory of the lord filled the house  
2and the priests could not enter into 
the house of the lord because the 
glory of the lord filled the l ords 
house  3and all the children of israel 
looked on  when the fire came down  
and the glory of the lord was upon the 
house  and they bowed themselves 
with their faces to the ground upon the 
pavement  and prostrated themselves  
and gave thanks unto the lord for he 
is good  for his mercy endureth for 
ever  
4and the king and all the people 
offered sacrifice b efore the lord 5and 
king solomon offered a sacrifice of 
twenty and two thousand oxen  and a 
hundred and twenty thousand sheep  so the king and all the people 
dedicated the house of god  6and the 
priests stood  according to their 
offices  the levites also with 
instruments of music of the lord 
which david the king had made  to 
give thanks unto the lord for his 
mercy endureth for ever  with the 
praises of david by their hand  and the 
priests sounded trumpets over against 
them  and all israel stood  7moreove r 
solomon hallowed the middle of the 
court that was before the house of the 
lord for there he offered the burnt 
offerings  and the fat of the peace 
offerings  because the brazen altar 
which solomon had made was not able 
to receive the burnt offering  and the 
meal offering  and the fat   
8so solomon held the feast at that 
time seven days  and all israel with 
him a very great congregation  from 
the entrance of hamath unto the brook 
of egypt  9and on the eighth day they 
held a solemn assembly  for they kept 
the dedication of the altar seven days  
and the feast seven days  10and on the 
three and twentieth day of the seventh 
month he sent the people away unto 
their tents  joyful and glad of heart for 
the goodness that the lord had shown 
unto david  and to solom on and to 
israel his people   
11thus solomon finished the house 
of the lord and the king s house  and 
all that came into solomon s heart to 
make in the house of the lord and in 
his own house  he prosperously 
effected  12and the lord appeared to 7 second chronicles  
1312  
 solomon by night  and said unto him  
i have heard thy prayer  and have 
chosen this place to myself for a house 
of sacrifice  13if i shut up heaven that 
there be no rain  or if i command the 
locust to devour the land  or if i send 
pestilence among my people  14if my 
people  upon whom my name is 
called  shall humble themselves  and 
pray and seek my face  and turn from 
their evil ways  then will i hear from 
heaven  and will forgive their sin  and 
will heal their land  15now mine eyes 
shall be open  and mine ears att ent 
unto the prayer that is made in this 
place  16for now have i chosen and 
hallowed this house  that my name 
may be there for ever  and mine eyes 
and my heart shall be there 
perpetually  17and as for thee  if thou 
wilt walk before me as david thy 
father walked  and do according to all 
that i have commanded thee  and wilt 
keep my statutes and mine ordinances  
18then i will establish the throne of thy 
kingdom  according as i covenanted 
with david thy father  saying  there 
shall not fail thee a man to be rul er in 
israel  19but if ye turn away  and 
forsake my statutes and my 
commandments which i have set 
before you  and shall go and serve 
other gods  and worship them  20then 
will i pluck them up by the roots out of 
my land which i have given them  and 
this hou se which i have hallowed for 
my name  will i cast out of my sight  
and i will make it a proverb and a 
byword among all peoples  21and this house  which is so high  every one that 
passeth by it shall be astonished  and 
shall say  why hath the lord done 
thus unto this land  and to this house  
22and they shall answer  because they 
forsook the lord the god of their 
fathers  who brought them forth out of 
the land of egypt  and laid hold on 
other gods  and worshipped them  and 
served them  therefore hath he 
brought all this evil upon them   
and it came to pass at the end of 
twenty years  wherein solomon 
had built the house of the lord and 
his own house  2that the cities which 
huram had given to solomon  
solomon built them  and caused the 
children of israel t o dwell there   
3and solomon went to hamath 
zobah  and prevailed against it  4and 
he built tadmor in the wilderness  and 
all the store cities  which he built in 
hamath  5also he built beth horon the 
upper  and beth horon the nether  
fortified cities  with walls  gates  and 
bars 6and baalath  and all the store 
cities that solomon had  and all the 
cities for his chariots  and the cities for 
his horsemen  and all that solomon 
desired to build for his pleasure in 
jerusalem  and in lebanon  and in all 
the land of his dominion   
7as for all the people that were left 
of the hittites  and the amorites  and 
the perizzites  and the hivites  and the 
jebusites  who were not of israel  8of 
their children that were left after them 
in the land  whom the children of 
israel  consumed not  of them did 8 second chronicles  
1313  
 solomon raise a levy of bondservants  
unto this day  9but of the children of 
israel did solomon make no servants 
for his work  but they were men of 
war and chief of his captains  and 
rulers of his chariots and of his 
horsemen   
10and these were the chief officers 
of king solomon  even two hundred 
and fifty  that bore rule over the 
people   
11and solomon brought up the 
daughter of pharaoh out of the city of 
david unto the house that he had built 
for her  for he said  no wife of m ine 
shall dwell in the house of david king 
of israel  because the places are holy  
whereunto the ark of the lord hath 
come   
12then solomon offered burnt 
offerings unto the lord on the altar of 
the lord which he had built before the 
porch  13even as the duty of every day 
required  offering according to the 
commandment of moses  on the 
sabbaths  and on the new moons  and 
on the appointed seasons  three times 
in the year  even in the feast of 
unleavened bread  and in the feast of 
weeks  and in the feast of tabernacles  
14and he appointed  according to the 
ordinance of david his father  the 
courses of the priests to their service  
and the levites to their charges  to 
praise  and to minister before the 
priests  as the duty of every day 
required  the doorkeeper s also by their 
courses at every gate  for so had david 
the man of god commanded  15and they departed not from the 
commandment of the king unto the 
priests and levites concerning any 
matter  or concerning the treasures  
16so all the work of solomon was set  
in order from the day of the foundation 
of the house of the lord and until it 
was finished  so the house of the lord 
was perfected   
17then went solomon to ezion 
geber  and to eloth  on the sea shore in 
the land of edom  18and huram sent 
him by the hands  of his servants ships  
and servants that had knowledge of the 
sea and they came with the servants of 
solomon to ophir  and fetched from 
thence four hundred and fifty talents of 
gold and brought them to king 
solomon   
and when the queen of sheba 
heard of the fame of solomon  
she came to prove solomon with hard 
questions at jerusalem  with a very 
great train  and camels that bore spices 
and gold in abundance  and precious 
stones  and when she was come to 
solomon  she spoke with him of all 
that was in her  heart  2and solomon 
told her all her questions  and there 
was not any thing hid from solomon 
which he told her not  3and when the 
queen of sheba had seen the wisdom 
of solomon  and the house that he had 
built 4and the food of his table  and 
the sitting o f his servants  and the 
attendance of his ministers  and their 
apparel  his cupbearers also  and their 
apparel  and his ascent by which he 
went up into the house of the lord 9 second chronicles  
1314  
 there was no more spirit in her  5and 
she said to the king  it was a true 
report  that i heard in mine own land of 
thine acts  and of thy wisdom  
6howbeit i believed not their words  
until i came  and mine eyes had seen 
it and behold  the half of the 
greatness of thy wisdom was not told 
me thou exceedest the fame that i 
heard  7happ y are thy men  and happy 
are these thy servants  that stand 
continually before thee  and hear thy 
wisdom  8blessed be the lord thy 
god who delighted in thee  to set thee 
on his throne  to be king for the lord 
thy god  because thy god loved israel  
to esta blish them for ever  therefore 
made he thee king over them  to do 
justice and righteousness   
9and she gave the king a hundred 
and twenty talents of gold  and spices 
in great abundance  and precious 
stones  neither was there any such 
spice as the queen of  sheba gave to 
king solomon  10and the servants also 
of huram  and the servants of 
solomon that brought gold from 
ophir  brought sandal wood and 
precious stones  11and the king made 
of the sandal wood paths for the house 
of the lord and for the king s hou se 
and harps and psalteries for the 
singers  and there were none such seen 
before in the land of judah  12and king 
solomon gave to the queen of sheba 
all her desire  whatsoever she asked  
beside that which she had brought unto 
the king  so she turned  and went to 
her own land  she and her servants   13now the weight of gold that came 
to solomon in one year was six 
hundred and threescore and six talents 
of gold  14beside that which the 
traffickers and merchants brought  and 
all the kings of arabia and the 
governors of the country brought gold 
and silver to solomon  15and king 
solomon made two hundred targets of 
beaten gold  six hundred shekels of 
beaten gold went to one target  16three 
hundred shields of beaten gold also  
three hundred shekels of gold went t o 
one shield  and the king put them in 
the house of the forest of lebanon   
17moreover the king made a great 
throne of ivory  and overlaid it with 
pure gold  18and there were six steps 
to the throne  with a footstool of gold  
which were fastened to the thr one and 
arms on either side by the place of the 
seat and two lions standing beside the 
arms  19and twelve lions stood there 
on the one side and on the other upon 
the six steps  there was not the like 
made in any kingdom   
20and all king solomon s drinkin g
vessels were of gold  and all the 
vessels of the house of the forest of 
lebanon were of pure gold  silver was 
nothing accounted of in the days of 
solomon  21for the king had ships that 
went to tarshish with the servants of 
huram  once every three years c ame 
the ships of tarshish  bringing gold  
and silver  ivory  and apes  and 
peacocks   
22so king solomon exceeded all the 
kings of the earth in riches and second chronicles  
1315  
 wisdom  23and all the kings of the 
earth sought the presence of solomon  
to hear his wisdom  which god  had 
put in his heart  24and they brought 
every man his present  vessels of 
silver  and vessels of gold  and 
raiment  armour  and spices  horses  
and mules  a rate year by year   
25and solomon had four thousand 
stalls for horses and chariots  and 
twelve th ousand horsemen  that he 
bestowed in the chariot cities  and with 
the king at jerusalem  26and he ruled 
over all the kings from the river even 
unto the land of the philistines  and to 
the border of egypt  27and the king 
made silver to be in jerusalem as 
stones and cedars made he to be as the 
sycamore trees that are in the 
lowland  for abundance  28and they 
brought horses for solomon out of 
egypt  and out of all lands   
29now the rest of the acts of 
solomon  first and last  are they not 
written in the words  of nathan the 
prophet  and in the prophecy of ahijah 
the shilonite  and in the visions of 
jedo the seer concerning jeroboam the 
son of nebat  30and solomon reigned 
in jerusalem over all israel forty years  
31and solomon slept with his fathers  
they buried  him in the city of david 
his father  and rehoboam his son 
reigned in his stead   
and rehoboam went to 
shechem  for all israel were 
come to shechem to make him king  
2and it came to pass  when jeroboam 
the son of nebat heard of it for he was in egypt  whither he had fled from 
the presence of king solomon that 
jeroboam returned out of egypt  3and 
they sent and called him  and 
jeroboam and all israel came  and they 
spoke to rehoboam  saying  4thy 
father made our yoke grievous  now 
therefore make thou the grievous 
service of thy father  and his heavy 
yoke which he put upon us  lighter  
and we will serve thee  5and he said 
unto them  come again unto me after 
three days  and the people departed   
6and king rehoboam took counsel 
with the old men  that had s tood before 
solomon his father while he yet lived  
saying  what counsel give ye me to 
return answer to this people  7and 
they spoke unto him  saying  if thou 
be kind to this people  and please 
them  and speak good words to them  
then they will be thy se rvants for 
ever 8but he forsook the counsel of 
the old men which they had given him  
and took counsel with the young men 
that were grown up with him  that 
stood before him  9and he said unto 
them  what counsel give ye  that we 
may return answer to this people  who 
have spoken to me  saying  make the 
yoke that thy father did put upon us 
lighter  10and the young men that 
were grown up with him spoke unto 
him saying  thus shalt thou say unto 
the people that spoke unto thee  
saying  thy father made our yo ke 
heavy  but make thou it lighter unto 
us thus shalt thou say unto them  my 
little finger is thicker than my father s 10 second chronicles  
1316  
 loins  11and now whereas my father 
did lade you with a heavy yoke  i will 
add to your yoke  my father chastised 
you with whips  but i wi ll chastise you 
with scorpions   
12so jeroboam and all the people 
came to rehoboam the third day  as 
the king bade  saying  come to me 
again the third day  13and the king 
answered them roughly  and king 
rehoboam forsook the counsel of the 
old men  14and spoke to them after the 
counsel of the young men  saying  
my father  made your yoke heavy  
but i will add thereto  my father 
chastised you with whips  but i will 
chastise you with scorpions  15so the 
king hearkened not unto the people  
for it was broug ht about of god  that 
the lord might establish his word  
which he spoke by the hand of ahijah 
the shilonite to jeroboam the son of 
nebat   
16and when all israel saw that the 
king hearkened not unto them  the 
people answered the king  saying  
what portio n have we in david  
neither have we inheritance in the son 
of jesse  every man to your tents  o 
israel  now see to thine own house  
david  so all israel departed unto 
their tents  17but as for the children of 
israel that dwelt in the cities of judah  
reho boam reigned over them  18then 
king rehoboam sent hadoram  who 
was over the levy  and the children of 
israel stoned him with stones  so that 
he died  and king rehoboam made 
speed to get him up to his chariot  to flee to jerusalem  19so israel rebelled 
against the house of david unto this 
day  
and when rehoboam was 
come to jerusalem  he 
assembled the house of judah and 
benjamin  a hundred and fourscore 
thousand chosen men  that were 
warriors  to fight against israel  to 
bring the kingdom back to rehoboam  
2but the word of the lord came to 
shemaiah the man of god  saying  
3speak unto rehoboam the son of 
solomon  king of judah  and to all 
israel in judah and benjamin  saying  
4thus saith the lord ye shall not go 
up nor fight against your brethren  
return  every man to his house  for this 
thing is of me  so they hearkened 
unto the words of the lord and 
returned from going against jeroboam   
5and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem  
and built cities for defence in judah  
6he built even beth lehem  and etam  
and te koa 7and beth zur and soco  
and adullam  8and gath  and 
mareshah  and ziph  9and adoraim  
and lachish  and azekah  10and zorah  
and aijalon  and hebron  which are in 
judah and in benjamin  fortified cities  
11and he fortified the strongholds  and 
put cap tains in them  and store of 
victual  and oil and wine  12and in 
every city he put shields and spears  
and made them exceeding strong  and 
judah and benjamin adhered to him   
13and the priests and the levites 
that were in all israel presented 
themselves to him out of all their 11 second chronicles  
1317  
 border  14for the levites left their open 
land and their possession  and came to 
judah and jerusalem  for jeroboam 
and his sons cast them off  that they 
should not execute the priest s office 
unto the lord 15and he appointed him 
pries ts for the high places  and for the 
satyrs  and for the calves which he had 
made  16and after them  out of all the 
tribes of israel  such as set their hearts 
to seek the lord the god of israel  
came to jerusalem to sacrifice unto the 
lord the god of thei r fathers  17so 
they strengthened the kingdom of 
judah  and made rehoboam the son of 
solomon strong  three years  for they 
walked three years in the way of david 
and solomon   
18and rehoboam took him a wife  
mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the 
son of dav id and of abihail the 
daughter of eliab the son of jesse  
19and she bore him sons  jeush  and 
shemariah  and zaham  20and after 
her he took maacah the daughter of 
absalom  and she bore him abijah  
and attai  and ziza  and shelomith  
21and rehoboam loved m aacah the 
daughter of absalom above all his 
wives and his concubines for he took 
eighteen wives  and threescore 
concubines  and begot twenty and 
eight sons and threescore daughters  
22and rehoboam appointed abijah the 
son of maacah to be chief  even the 
prince among his brethren  for he was 
minded to make him king  23and he 
dealt wisely  and dispersed of all his 
sons throughout all the lands of judah and benjamin  unto every fortified 
city and he gave them victual in 
abundance  and he sought for them 
many wives   
and it came to pass  when the 
kingdom of rehoboam was 
established  and he was strong  that he 
forsook the law of the lord and all 
israel with him  2and it came to pass 
in the fifth year of king rehoboam  
that shishak king of egypt came up 
again st jerusalem  because they had 
dealt treacherously with the lord 
3with twelve hundred chariots  and 
threescore thousand horsemen  and the 
people were without number that came 
with him out of egypt  the lubim  the 
sukkiim  and the ethiopians  4and he 
took the fortified cities which 
pertained to judah  and came unto 
jerusalem  5now shemaiah the 
prophet came to rehoboam  and to the 
princes of judah  that were gathered 
together to jerusalem because of 
shishak  and said unto them  thus 
saith the lord ye have forsaken me  
therefore have i also left you in the 
hand of shishak  6then the princes of 
israel and the king humbled 
themselves  and they said  the lord 
is righteous  7and when the lord saw 
that they humbled themselves  the 
word of the lord came to shem aiah 
saying  they have humbled 
themselves  i will not destroy them  
but i will grant them some deliverance  
and my wrath shall not be poured out 
upon jerusalem by the hand of 
shishak  8nevertheless they shall be 12 second chronicles  
1318  
 his servants  that they may know my 
servic e and the service of the 
kingdoms of the countries   
9so shishak king of egypt came up 
against jerusalem  and took away the 
treasures of the house of the lord and 
the treasures of the king s house  he 
took all away  he took away also the 
shields of gold  which solomon had 
made  10and king rehoboam made in 
their stead shields of brass  and 
committed them to the hands of the 
captains of the guard  that kept the 
door of the king s house  11and it was 
so that as oft as the king entered into 
the house of the lord the guard came 
and bore them  and brought them back 
into the guard chamber  12and when 
he humbled himself  the anger of the 
lord turned from him  that he would 
not destroy him altogether  and 
moreover in judah there were good 
things found   
13so king  rehoboam strengthened 
himself in jerusalem  and reigned  for 
rehoboam was forty and one years old 
when he began to reign  and he 
reigned seventeen years in jerusalem  
the city which the lord had chosen out 
of all the tribes of israel  to put his 
name ther e and his mother s name 
was naamah the ammonitess  14and 
he did that which was evil  because he 
set not his heart to seek the lord  
15now the acts of rehoboam  first 
and last  are they not written in the 
histories of shemaiah the prophet and 
of iddo the seer after the manner of 
genealogies  and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam 
continually  16and rehoboam slept 
with his fathers  and was buried in the 
city of david  and abijah his son 
reigned in his stead   
in the eighteenth year of king 
jeroboam began abijah to 
reign over judah  2three years reigned 
he in jerusalem  and his mother s 
name was micaiah the daughter of 
uriel of gibeah  and there was war 
between abijah and jeroboam  3and 
abijah joined battle with an army of 
valiant men of war  even four hundred 
thousand chosen men  and jeroboam 
set the battle in array against him with 
eight hundred thousand chosen men  
who were mighty men of valour  4and 
abijah stood up upon mount 
zemaraim  which is in the hill country 
of ephraim  and said  hear  me o 
jeroboam and all israel  5ought ye not 
to know that the lord the god of 
israel  gave the kingdom over israel to 
david for ever  even to him and to his 
sons by a covenant of salt  6yet 
jeroboam the son of nebat  the servant 
of solomon the son of dav id rose up  
and rebelled against his lord  7and 
there were gathered unto him vain 
men base fellows that strengthened 
themselves against rehoboam the son 
of solomon  when rehoboam was 
young and faint hearted  and could not 
withstand them  8and now ye thin k to 
withstand the kingdom of the lord in 
the hand of the sons of david  and ye 
are a great multitude  and there are 
with you the golden calves which 13 second chronicles  
1319  
 jeroboam made you for gods  9have 
ye not driven out the priests of the 
lord the sons of aaron  and the 
levites  and have made you priests 
after the manner of the peoples of 
other lands  so that whosoever cometh 
to consecrate himself with a young 
bullock and seven rams  the same 
becometh a priest of them that are no 
gods  10but as for us  the lord is our 
god and we have not forsaken him  
and we have priests ministering unto 
the lord the sons of aaron  and the 
levites in their work  11and they burn 
unto the lord every morning and 
every evening burnt offerings and 
sweet incense  the showbread also set 
they in o rder upon the pure table  and 
the candlestick of gold with the lamps 
thereof  to burn every evening  for we 
keep the charge of the lord our god  
but ye have forsaken him  12and 
behold  god is with us at our head  and 
his priests with the trumpets of alarm  
to sound an alarm against you  o 
children of israel  fight ye not against 
the lord the god of your fathers  for 
ye shall not prosper   
13but jeroboam caused an 
ambushment to come about behind 
them  so they were before judah  and 
the ambushment was behin d them  
14and when judah looked back  
behold  the battle was before and 
behind them  and they cried unto the 
lord and the priests sounded with the 
trumpets  15then the men of judah 
gave a shout  and as the men of judah 
shouted  it came to pass  that god smote jeroboam and all israel before 
abijah and judah  16and the children 
of israel fled before judah  and god 
delivered them into their hand  17and 
abijah and his people slew them with 
a great slaughter  so there fell down 
slain of israel five hundred thou sand 
chosen men  18thus the children of 
israel were brought under at that time  
and the children of judah prevailed  
because they relied upon the lord the 
god of their fathers  19and abijah 
pursued after jeroboam  and took 
cities from him  bethel with the  towns 
thereof  and jeshanah with the towns 
thereof  and ephrain with the towns 
thereof  20neither did jeroboam 
recover strength again in the days of 
abijah  and the lord smote him  and 
he died  21but abijah waxed mighty  
and took unto himself fourteen wiv es 
and begot twenty and two sons  and 
sixteen daughters  22and the rest of the 
acts of abijah  and his ways  and his 
sayings  are written in the commentary 
of the prophet iddo   
23so abijah slept with his fathers  
and they buried him in the city of 
david  and asa his son reigned in his 
stead  in his days the land was quiet  
ten years   1and asa did that 
which was good and right in 
the eyes of the lord his god  2for he 
took away the strange altars  and the 
high places  and broke down the 
pillars  and hew ed down the asherim  
3and commanded judah to seek the 
lord the god of their fathers  and to 
do the law and the commandment   14 second chronicles  
1320  
 4also he took away out of all the cities 
of judah the high places and the sun 
images  and the kingdom was quiet 
before him   5and he built fortified 
cities in judah  for the land was quiet  
and he had no war in those years  
because the lord had given him rest   
6for he said unto judah  let us build 
these cities  and make about them 
walls  and towers  gates  and bars  the 
land is yet  before us  because we have 
sought the lord our god  we have 
sought him  and he hath given us rest 
on every side  so they built and 
prospered   7and asa had an army that 
bore bucklers and spears  out of judah 
three hundred thousand  and out of 
benjamin  that bore shields and drew 
bows  two hundred and fourscore 
thousand  all these were mighty men 
of valour    
8and there came out against them 
zerah the ethiopian with an army of a 
thousand thousand  and three hundred 
chariots  and he came unto mareshah  
9then asa went out to meet him  and 
they set the battle in array in the valley 
of zephath at mareshah  10and asa 
cried unto the lord his god  and said  
lord there is none beside thee to 
help between the mighty and him that 
hath no strength  help us  o lord our 
god for we rely on thee  and in thy 
name are we come against this 
multitude  thou art the lord our god  
let not man prevail against thee  11so 
the lord smote the ethiopians before 
asa and before judah  and the 
ethiopians fled  12and asa and the peop le that were with him pursued 
them unto gerar  and there fell of the 
ethiopians so that none remained 
alive  for they were shattered before 
the lord and before his host  and 
they carried away very much booty  
13and they smote all the cities round 
about ge rar for a terror from the lord 
came upon them  and they spoiled all 
the cities  for there was much spoil in 
them  14they smote also the tents of 
cattle  and carried away sheep in 
abundance and camels  and returned to 
jerusalem   
and the spirit of god c ame 
upon azariah the son of oded  
2and he went out to meet asa  and said 
unto him  hear ye me  asa and all 
judah and benjamin  the lord is with 
you while ye are with him  and if ye 
seek him  he will be found of you  but 
if ye forsake him  he will forsak e you  
3now for long seasons israel was 
without the true god  and without a 
teaching priest  and without law  4but 
when in their distress they turned unto 
the lord the god of israel  and sought 
him he was found of them  5and in 
those times there was no p eace to him 
that went out  nor to him that came in  
but great discomfitures were upon all 
the inhabitants of the lands  6and they 
were broken in pieces  nation against 
nation  and city against city  for god 
did discomfit them with all manner of 
adversity  7but be ye strong  and let 
not your hands be slack  for your work 
shall be rewarded   15 second chronicles  
1321  
 8and when asa heard these words  
even the prophecy of oded the 
prophet  he took courage  and put 
away the detestable things out of all 
the land of judah and benjamin  and 
out of the cities which he had taken 
from the hill country of ephraim  and 
he renewed the altar of the lord that 
was before the porch of the lord 
9and he gathered all judah and 
benjamin  and them that sojourned 
with them out of ephraim and 
manasseh  and out of simeon  for they 
fell to him out of israel in abundance  
when they saw that the lord his god 
was with him  10so they gathered 
themselves together at jerusalem in the 
third month  in the fifteenth year of the 
reign of asa  11and they sacrificed 
unto the lord in that day  of the spoil 
which they had brought  seven 
hundred oxen and seven thousand 
sheep  12and they entered into the 
covenant to seek the lord the god of 
their fathers  with all their heart and 
with all their soul  13and that 
whosoever wo uld not seek the lord 
the god of israel  should be put to 
death  whether small or great  whether 
man or woman  14and they swore unto 
the lord with a loud voice  and with 
shouting  and with trumpets  and with 
horns  15and all judah rejoiced at the 
oath for they had sworn with all their 
heart  and sought him with their whole 
desire  and he was found of them  and 
the lord gave them rest round about   
16and also maacah the mother of 
asa the king  he removed her from being queen  because she had made an 
abomin able image for an asherah  and 
asa cut down her image  and made 
dust of it  and burnt it at the brook 
kidron  17but the high places were not 
taken away out of israel  nevertheless 
the heart of asa was whole all his 
days 18and he brought into the house 
of god the things that his father had 
hallowed  and that he himself had 
hallowed  silver  and gold  and vessels  
19and there was no more war unto the 
five and thirtieth year of the reign of 
asa  
in the six and thirtieth year of 
the reign of asa  baasa kin g of 
israel went up against judah  and built 
ramah  that he might not suffer any to 
go out or come in to asa king of 
judah  2then asa brought out silver 
and gold out of the treasures of the 
house of the lord and of the king s 
house  and sent to ben hadad k ing of 
aram  that dwelt at adamascus  
saying  3there is a league between me 
and thee  as there was between my 
father and thy father  behold  i have 
sent thee silver and gold  go break thy 
league with baasa king of israel  that 
he may depart from me  4and ben 
hadad hearkened unto king asa  and 
sent the captains of his armies against 
the cities of israel  and they smote 
ijon and dan  and abelmaim  and all 
the store cities of naphtali  5and it 
came to pass  when baasa heard 
                                                      
a heb darmesek  and in xxiv 23 
xxviii 5 23  16 second chronicles  
1322  
 thereof  that he left off buildi ng 
ramah  and let his work cease  6then 
asa the king took all judah  and they 
carried away the stones of ramah  and 
the timber thereof  wherewith baasa 
had builded  and he built therewith 
geba and mizpah   
7and at that time hanani the seer 
came to asa king  of judah  and said 
unto him  because thou hast relied on 
the king of aram  and hast not relied 
on the lord thy god  therefore is the 
host of the king of aram escaped out 
of thy hand  8were not the ethiopians 
and the lubim a huge host  with 
chariots and h orsemen exceeding 
many  yet because thou didst rely on 
the lord he delivered them into thy 
hand  9for the eyes of the lord run to 
and fro throughout the whole earth  to 
show himself strong in the behalf of 
them whose heart is whole toward 
him herein tho u hast done foolishly  
for from henceforth thou shalt have 
wars  10then asa was wroth with the 
seer and put him in the prison house  
for he was in a rage with him because 
of this thing  and asa oppressed some 
of the people the same time   
11and behold  the acts of asa  first 
and last  lo they are written in the 
book of the kings of judah and israel  
12and in the thirty and ninth year of 
his reign asa was diseased in his feet  
his disease was exceeding great  yet in 
his disease he sought not to the lord 
but to the physicians  13and asa slept 
with his fathers  and died in the one 
and fortieth year of his reign  14and they buried him in his own sepulchres  
which he had hewn out for himself in 
the city of david  and laid him in the 
bed which was filled with  sweet 
odours and divers kinds of spices  
prepared by the perfumers art and 
they made a very great burning for 
him  
and jehoshaphat his son 
reigned in his stead  and 
strengthened himself against israel  
2and he placed forces in all the 
fortified citi es of judah  and set 
garrisons in the land of judah  and in 
the cities of ephraim  which asa his 
father had taken  3and the lord was 
with jehoshaphat  because he walked 
in the first ways of his father david  
and sought not unto the baalim  4but 
sought to t he god of his father  and 
walked in his commandments  and not 
after the doings of israel  5therefore 
the lord established the kingdom in 
his hand  and all judah brought to 
jehoshaphat presents  and he had 
riches and honour in abundance  6and 
his heart was lifted up in the ways of 
the lord and furthermore he took 
away the high places and the asherim 
out of judah   
7also in the third year of his reign 
he sent his princes  even ben hail and 
obadiah  and zechariah  and nethanel  
and micaiah  to teach in the c ities of 
judah  8and with them the levites  
even shemaiah  and nethaniah  and 
zebadiah  and asahel  and 
shemiramoth  and jehonathan  and 
adonijah  and tobijah  and tob 17 second chronicles  
1323  
 adonijah  the levites  and with them 
elishama and jehoram  the priests  
9and they taught  in judah  having the 
book of the law of the lord with 
them  and they went about throughout 
all the cities of judah  and taught 
among the people   
10and a terror from the lord fell 
upon all the kingdoms of the lands that 
were round about judah  so that the y 
made no war against jehoshaphat  
11and some of the philistines brought 
jehoshaphat presents  and silver for 
tribute  the arabians also brought him 
flocks  seven thousand and seven 
hundred rams  and seven thousand and 
seven hundred he goats  12and 
jehosha phat waxed great exceedingly  
and he built in judah castles and cities 
of store  13and he had many works in 
the cities of judah  and men of war  
mighty men of valour  in jerusalem  
14and this was the numbering of them 
according to their fathers houses  of 
judah  the captains of thousands  
adnah the captain  and with him 
mighty men of valour three hundred 
thousand  15and next to him jehohanan 
the captain  and with him two hundred 
and fourscore thousand  16and next to 
him amasiah the son of zichri  who 
willin gly offered himself unto the 
lord and with him two hundred 
thousand mighty men of valour  17and 
of benjamin  eliada a mighty man of 
valour  and with him two hundred 
thousand armed with bow and shield  
18and next to him jehozabad  and with 
him a hundred an d fourscore thousand ready prepared for war  19these were 
they that waited on the king beside 
those whom the king put in the 
fortified cities throughout all judah   
now jehoshaphat had riches 
and honour in abundance  and 
he allied himself with ahab by 
marriage  2and after a lapse of years 
he went down to ahab to samaria  
and ahab killed sheep and oxen for 
him in abundance  and for the people 
that were with him  and persuaded him 
to go up with him to ramoth gilead  
3and ahab king of israel said unto 
jehos haphat king of judah  wilt thou 
go with me to ramoth gilead  and he 
answered him  i am as thou art  and 
my people as thy people  and we will 
be with thee in the war   
4and jehoshaphat said unto the king 
of israel  inquire  i pray thee  at the 
word of the lord today  5then the 
king of israel gathered the prophets 
together  four hundred men  and said 
unto them  shall we go to ramoth 
gilead to battle  or shall i forbear  
and they said  go up  for god will 
deliver it into the hand of the king  
6but je hoshaphat said  is there not 
here besides a prophet of the lord 
that we might inquire of him  7and 
the king of israel said unto 
jehoshaphat  there is yet one man by 
whom we may inquire of the lord but 
i hate him  for he never prophesieth 
good concerni ng me  but always evil  
the same is micaiah the son of imla  
and jehoshaphat said  let not the 
king say so  8then the king of israel 18 second chronicles  
1324  
 called an officer  and said  fetch 
quickly micaiah the son of imla  
9now the king of israel and 
jehoshaphat the king o f judah sat each 
on his throne  arrayed in their robes  
and they sat in a threshing floor at the 
entrance of the gate of samaria  and all 
the prophets were prophesying before 
them  10and zedekiah the son of 
chenaanah made him horns of iron  
and said  thus  saith the lord with 
these shalt thou gore the arameans  
until they be consumed  11and all the 
prophets prophesied so  saying  go up 
to ramoth gilead  and prosper  for the 
lord will deliver it into the hand of the 
king  
12and the messenger that went t o 
call micaiah spoke to him  saying  
behold  the words of the prophets 
declare good to the king with one 
mouth  let thy word therefore  i pray 
thee be like one of theirs  and speak 
thou good  13and micaiah said  as 
the lord liveth  what my god saith  
that will i speak  14and when he was 
come to the king  the king said unto 
him amicaiah  shall we go to 
ramoth gilead to battle  or shall i 
forbear  and he said  go ye up  and 
prosper  and they shall be delivered 
into your hand  15and the king said to 
him how many times shall i adjure 
thee that thou speak unto me nothing 
but the truth in the name of the lord 
16and he said  i saw all israel 
scattered upon the mountains  as sheep 
                                                      
a heb micah  that have no shepherd  and the lord 
said these have no master  let the m 
return every man to his house in 
peace  17and the king of israel said to 
jehoshaphat  did i not tell thee that 
he would not prophesy good 
concerning me  but evil  18and he 
said therefore hear ye the word of 
the lord i saw the lord sitting upon 
his throne  and all the host of heaven 
standing on his right hand and on his 
left 19and the lord said who shall 
entice ahab king of israel  that he may 
go up and fall at ramoth gilead  and 
one spoke saying after this manner  
and another saying after that man ner 
20and there came forth the spirit  and 
stood before the lord and said  i will 
entice him  and the lord said unto 
him wherewith  21and he said  i will 
go forth  and will be a lying spirit in 
the mouth of all his prophets  and he 
said thou shalt enti ce him  and shalt 
prevail also  go forth  and do so  
22now therefore  behold  the lord hath 
put a lying spirit in the mouth of these 
thy prophets  and the lord hath 
spoken evil concerning thee   
23then zedekiah the son of 
chenaanah came near  and smote 
micaiah upon the check  and said  
which way went the spirit of the 
lord from me to speak unto thee  
24and micaiah said  behold  thou 
shalt see on that day  when thou shalt 
go into an inner chamber to hide 
thyself  25and the king of israel said  
take ye micaiah  and carry him back 
unto amon the governor of the city  second chronicles  
1325  
 and to joash the king s son  26and say  
thus saith the king  put this fellow in 
the prison  and feed him with scant 
bread and with scant water  until i 
return in peace  27and micaiah said  
if thou return at all in peace  the lord 
hath not spoken by me  and he said  
hear  ye peoples  all of you   
28so the king of israel and 
jehoshaphat the kind of judah went up 
to ramoth gilead  29and the king of 
israel said unto jehoshaphat  i will 
disgui se myself  and go into the battle  
but put thou on thy robes  so the king 
of israel disguised himself  and they 
went into the battle  30now the king of 
aram had commanded the captains of 
his chariots  saying  fight neither 
with small nor great  save only  with 
the king of israel  31and it came to 
pass when the captains of the chariots 
saw jehoshaphat  that they said  it is 
the king of israel  therefore they 
turned about to fight against him  but 
jehoshaphat cried out  and the lord 
helped him  and god m oved them to 
depart from him  32and it came to 
pass when the captains of the chariots 
saw that it was not the king of israel  
that they turned back from pursuing 
him 33and a certain man drew his bow 
at a venture  and smote the king of 
israel between the lower armour and 
the breastplate  wherefore he said to 
the driver of the chariot  turn thy 
hand  and carry me out of the host  for 
i am sore wounded  34and the battle 
increased that day  howbeit the king of 
israel stayed himself up in his chariot against  the arameans until the even  
and about the time of the going down 
of the sun he died   
and jehoshaphat the king of 
judah returned to his house in 
peace to jerusalem  2and jehu the son 
of hanani the seer went out to meet 
him and said to king jehoshapha t 
shouldest thou help the wicked  and 
love them that hate the lord for this 
thing wrath is upon thee from before 
the lord 3nevertheless there are good 
things found in thee  in that thou hast 
put away the asheroth out of the land  
and hast set thy heart  to seek god   
4and jehoshaphat dwelt at 
jerusalem  and he went out again 
among the people from beer sheba to 
the hill country of ephraim  and 
brought them back unto the lord the 
god of their fathers  5and he set 
judges in the land throughout all the 
fortified cities of judah  city by city  
6and said to the judges  consider what 
ye do  for ye judge not for man  but for 
the lord and he is  with you in 
giving judgment  7now therefore let 
the fear of the lord be upon you  take 
heed and do it  for there is  no iniquity 
with the lord our god  nor respect of 
persons  nor taking of bribes  
8moreover in jerusalem did 
jehoshaphat set of the levites and the 
priests  and of the heads of the 
fathers houses of israel  for the 
judgment of the lord and for 
controvers ies and they returned to 
jerusalem  9and he charged them  
saying  thus shall ye do in the fear of 19 second chronicles  
1326  
 the lord faithfully  and with a whole 
heart  10and whensoever any 
controversy shall come to you from 
your brethren that dwell in their cities  
between bloo d and blood  between law 
and commandment  statutes and 
ordinances  ye shall warn them  that 
they be not guilty towards the lord 
and so wrath come upon you and upon 
your brethren  thus shall ye do  and ye 
shall not be guilty  11and behold  
amariah the chi ef priest is over you in 
all matters of the lord and zebadiah 
the son of ishmael  the ruler of the 
house of judah  in all the king s 
matters  also the officers of the levites 
before you  deal courageously  and the 
lord be with the good   
and it came t o pass after this  
that the children of moab  and 
the children of ammon  and with them 
some of the ammonites  came against 
jehoshaphat to battle  2then there 
came some that told jehoshaphat  
saying  there cometh a great 
multitude against thee from beyond the 
sea from aram  and behold  they are 
in hazazon tamar the same is en 
gedi 3and jehoshaphat feared  and set 
himself to seek unto the lord and he 
proclaimed a fast throughout all judah  
4and judah gathered themselves 
together  to seek help of the lord 
even out of all the cities of judah they 
came to seek the lord 5and 
jehoshaphat stood in the congregation 
of judah and jerusalem  in the house 
of the lord before the new court  6and 
he said  o lord the god of our fathers  art not thou alone god in 
heaven  and art not thou ruler over all 
the kingdoms of the nations  and in 
thy hand is power and might  so that 
none is able to withstand thee  7didst 
not thou  o our god  drive out the 
inhabitants of this land before thy 
people israel  and gavest it to the  seed 
of abraham thy friend for ever  8and 
they dwelt therein  and have built thee 
a sanctuary therein for thy name  
saying  9if evil come upon us  the 
sword  judgment  or pestilence  or 
famine  we will stand before this 
house  and before thee for thy 
name  is in this house and cry unto 
thee in our affliction  and thou wilt 
hear and save  10and now  behold  the 
children of ammon and moab and 
mount seir  whom thou wouldest not 
let israel invade  when they came out 
of the land of egypt  but they turned 
aside f rom them  and destroyed them 
not 11behold  they render unto us 
evil to come to cast us out of thy 
possession  which thou hast given us 
to inherit  12o our god  wilt thou not 
execute judgment on them  for we 
have no might against this great 
multitude th at cometh against us  
neither know we what to do  but our 
eyes are upon thee  13and all judah 
stood before the lord with their little 
ones their wives  and their children  
 14then upon jahaziel the son of 
zechariah  the son of benaiah  the son 
of jeiel  the son of mattaniah  the 
levite  of the sons of asaph  came the 
spirit of the lord in the midst of the 20 second chronicles  
1327  
 congregation  15and he said  hearken 
ye all judah  and ye inhabitants of 
jerusalem  and thou king jehoshaphat  
thus saith the lord unto you  fear not  
ye neither be dismayed by reason of 
this great multitude  for the battle is 
not yours  but god s 16tomorrow go 
ye down against them  behold  they 
come up by the ascent of ziz  and ye 
shall find them at the end of the valley  
before the wilderness of je ruel 17ye 
shall not need to fight in this battle  set 
yourselves  stand ye still  and see the 
salvation of the lord with you  o 
judah and jerusalem  fear not  nor be 
dismayed  tomorrow go out against 
them  for the lord is with you  18and 
jehoshaphat bow ed his head with his 
face to the ground  and all judah and 
the inhabitants of jerusalem fell down 
before the lord worshipping the 
lord 19and the levites  of the 
children of the kohathites and of the 
children of the korahites  stood up to 
praise the lord the god of israel  with 
an exceeding loud voice   
20and they rose early in the morning  
and went forth into the wilderness of 
tekoa  and as they went forth  
jehoshaphat stood and said  hear me  
o judah  and ye inhabitants of 
jerusalem  believe in the lord your 
god so shall ye be established  
believe his prophets  so shall ye 
prosper  21and when he had taken 
counsel with the people  he appointed 
them that should sing unto the lord 
and praise in the beauty of holiness  as 
they went out before the army  and say give thanks unto the lord for 
his mercy endureth for ever  22and 
when they began to sing and to praise  
the lord set liers inwait against the 
children of ammon  moab  and mount 
seir that were come against judah  
and they were smitten  23for th e 
children of ammon and moab stood 
up against the inhabitants of mount 
seir utterly to slay and destroy them  
and when they had made an end of the 
inhabitants of seir  every one helped to 
destroy another   
24and when judah came to the watch 
tower of the w ilderness  they looked 
upon the multitude  and behold  they 
were dead bodies fallen to the earth  
and there were none that escaped  
25and when jehoshaphat and his 
people came to take the spoil of them  
they found among them in abundance 
both riches and de ad bodies  and 
precious jewels  which they stripped 
off for themselves  more than they 
could carry away  and they were three 
days in taking the spoil  it was so 
much  26and on the fourth day they 
assembled themselves in the valley of 
aberacah  for there th ey blessed the 
lord therefore the name of that place 
was called the valley of beracah  unto 
this day  27then they returned  every 
man of judah and jerusalem  and 
jehoshaphat in the forefront of them  
to go back to jerusalem with joy  for 
the lord had made  them to rejoice 
over their enemies  28and they came to 
                                                      
a that is blessing  second chronicles  
1328  
 jerusalem with psalteries and harps 
and trumpets unto the house of the 
lord 29and a terror from god was on 
all the kingdoms of the countries  
when they heard that the lord fought 
against the enemies of israel  30so the 
realm of jehoshaphat was quiet  for his 
god gave him rest round about   
31and jehoshaphat reigned over 
judah  he was thirty and five years old 
when he began to reign  and he 
reigned twenty and five years in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
azubah the daughter of shilhi  32and 
he walked in the way of asa his father  
and turned not aside from it  doing that 
which was right in the eyes of the 
lord 33howbeit the high places were 
not taken away  neither as yet had the 
people set their he arts unto the god of 
their fathers  34now the rest of the acts 
of jehoshaphat  first and last  behold  
they are written in the words of jehu 
the son of hanani  which is inserted in 
the book of the kings of israel    
35and after this did jehoshaphat 
king of  judah join himself with 
ahaziah king of israel  the same did 
very wickedly  36and he joined him 
with himself to make ships to go to 
tarshish  and they made the ships in 
ezion geber  37then eliezer the son of 
dodavahu of mareshah prophesied 
against jehosha phat saying  because 
thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah  
the lord hath made a breach in thy 
works  and the ships were broken  
that they were not able to go to 
tarshish   and jehoshaphat slept with his 
fathers  and was buried with 
his fathers in th e city of david  and 
jehoram his son reigned in his stead  
2and he had brethren the sons of 
jehoshaphat  azariah  and jehiel  and 
zechariah  and azariahu  and michael  
and shephatiah  all these were the sons 
of jehoshaphat king of israel  3and 
their father  gave them great gifts  of 
silver  and of gold  and of precious 
things  with fortified cities in judah  
but the kingdom gave he to jehoram  
because he was the first born 4now 
when jehoram was risen up over the 
kingdom of his father  and had 
strengthened h imself  he slew all his 
brethren with the sword  and divers 
also of the princes of israel  5jehoram 
was thirty and two years old when he 
began to reign  and he reigned eight 
years in jerusalem  6and he walked in 
the way of the kings of israel  as did 
the h ouse of ahab  for he had the 
daughter of ahab to wife  and he did 
that which was evil in the sight of the 
lord 7howbeit the lord would not 
destroy the house of david  because of 
the covenant that he had made with 
david  and as he promised to give a 
lamp t o him and to his children alway  
 8in his days edom revolted from 
under the hand of judah  and made a 
king over themselves  9then jehoram 
passed over with his captains  and all 
his chariots with him  and he rose up 
by night  and smote the edomites that 
compassed him about  and the captains 
of the chariots  10so edom revolted 21 second chronicles  
1329  
 from under the hand of judah unto this 
day then did libnah revolt at the same 
time from under his hand  because he 
had forsaken the lord the god of his 
fathers  11moreover he made hig h 
places in the mountains of judah  and 
made the inhabitants of jerusalem to 
go astray  and drew judah away  12and 
there came a writing to him from 
elijah the prophet  saying  thus saith 
the lord the god of david thy father  
because thou hast not walked in the 
ways of jehoshaphat thy father  nor in 
the ways of asa king of judah  13but 
hast walked in the way of the kings of 
israel  and hast made judah and the 
inhabitants of jerusalem to go astray  
like as the house of ahab made israel 
to go astray  and a lso hast slain thy 
brethren of thy father s house  who 
were better than thyself  14behold  the 
lord will smite with a great plague thy 
people  and thy children  and thy 
wives  and all thy substance  15and 
thou shalt have great sickness by 
disease of thy bo wels until thy bowels 
fall out by reason of the sickness  day 
by day   
16and the lord stirred up against 
jehoram the spirit of the philistines  
and of the arabians that are beside the 
ethiopians  17and they came up against 
judah  and broke into it  and c arried 
away all the substance that was found 
in the king s house  and his sons also  
and his wives  so that there was never 
a son left him  save jehoahaz  the 
youngest of his sons   18and after all this the lord smote 
him in his bowels with an incurable 
disease  19and it came to pass  that in 
process of time  at the end of two 
years  his bowels fell out by reason of 
his sickness  and he died of sore 
diseases  and his people made no 
burning for him  like the burning of his 
fathers  20thirty and two years old  was 
he when he began to reign  and he 
reigned in jerusalem eight years  and 
he departed joyless  and they buried 
him in the city of david  but not in the 
sepulchres of the kings   
and the inhabitants of 
jerusalem made ahaziah his 
youngest son king in h is stead  for the 
band of men that came with the 
arabians to the camp had slain all the 
eldest  so ahaziah the son of jehoram 
king of judah reigned  2forty and two 
years old was ahaziah when he began 
to reign  and he reigned one year in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
athaliah the daughter of omri  3he 
also walked in the ways of the house 
of ahab  for his mother was his 
counsellor to do wickedly  4and he did 
that which was evil in the sight of the 
lord as did the house of ahab  for 
they were his couns ellors after the 
death of his father  to his destruction  
5he walked also after their counsel  
and went with jehoram the son of 
ahab king of israel to war against 
hazael king of aram at ramoth 
gilead  and the arameans wounded 
joram  6and he returned to be healed 
in jezreel of the wounds which they 22 second chronicles  
1330  
 had given him at ramah  when he 
fought against hazael king of aram  
and azariah the son of jehoram king 
of judah went down to see jehoram 
the son of ahab in jezreel  because he 
was sick   
7now the downfall of ahaz iah was 
of god  in that he went unto joram  for 
when he was come  he went out with 
jehoram against jehu the son of 
nimshi  whom the lord had anointed 
to cut off the house of ahab  8and it 
came to pass  when jehu was 
executing judgment upon the house of 
ahab that he found the princes of 
judah  and the sons of the brethren of 
ahaziah  ministering to ahaziah  and 
slew them  9and he sought ahaziah  
and they caught him now he was 
hiding in samaria and they brought 
him to jehu  and slew him  and they 
buried him  for they said  he is the 
son of jehoshaphat  who sought the 
lord with all his heart  and there was 
none of the house of ahaziah that had 
power to hold the kingdom   
10now when athaliah the mother of 
ahaziah saw that her son was dead  
she arose and destr oyed all the seed 
royal of the house of judah  11but 
jehoshabeath  the daughter of the king  
took joash the son of ahaziah  and 
stole him away from among the king s 
sons that were slain  and put him and 
his nurse in the bed chamber  so 
jehoshabeath  the da ughter of king 
jehoram  the wife of jehoiada the 
priest for she was the sister of 
ahaziah hid him from athaliah  so that she slew him not  12and he was 
with them hid in the house of god six 
years  and athaliah reigned over the 
land  
and in the seventh year 
jehoiada strengthened himself  
and took the captains of hundreds  
azariah the son of jeroham  and 
ishmael the son of jehohanan  and 
azariah the son of obed  and 
maaseiah the son of adaiah  and 
elishaphat the son of zichri  into 
covenant with him  2and they went 
about in judah  and gathered the 
levites out of all the cities of judah  
and the heads of fathers houses of 
israel  and they came to jerusalem  
3and all the congregation made a 
covenant with the king in the house of 
god and he said unto them  behold  
the king s son shall reign  as the lord 
hath spoken concerning the sons of 
david  4this is the thing that ye shall 
do a third part of you  that come in on 
the sabbath  of the priests and of the 
levites  shall be porters of the doors  
5and a third part shall be at the king s 
house  and a third part at the gate of 
the foundation  and all the people shall 
be in the courts of the house of the 
lord 6but let none come into the 
house of the lord save the priests  
and they that minister of the levites  
they shall come in  for they are holy  
but all the people shall keep the charge 
of the lord 7and the levites shall 
compass the king round about  every 
man with his weapons in his hand  and 
whosoever cometh into the house  let 23 second chronicles  
1331  
 him be slain  and be ye with t he king 
when he cometh in  and when he goeth 
out  
8so the levites and all judah did 
according to all that jehoiada the priest 
commanded  and they took every man 
his men  those that were to come in on 
the sabbath  with those that were to go 
out on the sab bath for jehoiada the 
priest dismissed not the courses  9and 
jehoiada the priest delivered to the 
captains of hundreds the spears  and 
bucklers  and shields  that had been 
king david s which were in the house 
of god  10and he set all the people  
every ma n with his weapon in his 
hand  from the right side of the house 
to the left side of the house  along by 
the altar and the house  by the king 
round about  11then they brought out 
the king s son  and put upon him the 
crown and the insignia  and made him 
king and jehoiada and his sons 
anointed him  and they said  long 
live the king   
12and when athaliah heard the 
noise of the people running and 
praising the king  she came to the 
people into the house of the lord 
13and she looked  and behold  the king 
stood on his platform at the entrance  
and the captains and the trumpets by 
the king  and all the people of the land 
rejoiced  and blew with trumpets  the 
singers also played  on instruments of 
music  and led the singing of praise  
then athaliah rent her clot hes and 
said treason  treason  14and 
jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over 
the host  and said unto them  have 
her forth between the ranks  and 
whoso followeth her  let him be slain 
with the sword  for the priest said 
slay her not in the house of the lord 
15so they made way for her  and she 
went to the entry of the horse gate to 
the king s house  and they slew her 
there   
16and jehoiada made a covenant 
between himself  and all the people  
and the king  that the y should be the 
lords people  17and all the people 
went to the house of baal  and broke it 
down  and broke his altars and his 
images in pieces  and slew mattan the 
priest of baal before the altars  18and 
jehoiada appointed the offices of the 
house of the lord under the hand of 
the priests the levites  whom david 
had distributed in the house of the 
lord to offer the burnt offerings of 
the lord as it is written in the law of 
moses  with rejoicing and with 
singing  according to the direction of 
david  19and he set the porters at the 
gates of the house of the lord that 
none that was unclean in any thing 
should enter in  20and he took the 
captains of hundreds  and the nobles  
and the governors of the people  and 
all the people of the land  and brought 
down th e king from the house of the 
lord and they came through the upper 
gate unto the king s house  and set the 
king upon the throne of the kingdom  
21so all the people of the land rejoiced  second chronicles  
1332  
 and the city was quiet  and they slew 
athaliah with the sword   
joash was seven years old 
when he began to reign  and 
he reigned forty years in jerusalem  
and his mother s name was zibiah of 
beer sheba  2and joash did that which 
was right in the eyes of the lord all 
the days of jehoiada the priest  3and 
jehoiada took for him two wives  and 
he begot sons and daughters   
4and it came to pass after this  that 
joash was minded to restore the house 
of the lord 5and he gathered together 
the priests and the levites  and said to 
them  go out unto the cities of judah  
and gather of all israel money to repair 
the house of your god from year to 
year and see that ye hasten the 
matter  howbeit the levites hastened 
it not  6and the king called for 
jehoiada the chief  and unto him  
why hast thou not required of the 
levites to bring i n out of judah and 
out of jerusalem the tax of moses the 
servant of the lord and of the 
congregation of israel  for the tent of 
the testimony  7for the sons of 
athaliah  that wicked woman  had 
broken up the house of god  and also 
all the hallowed things of the house of 
the lord did they bestow upon the 
baalim   
8so the king commanded  and they 
made a chest  and set it without at the 
gate of the house of the lord 9and 
they made a proclamation through 
judah and jerusalem  to bring in for 
the lord the tax t hat moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the 
wilderness  10and all the princes and 
all the people rejoiced  and brought in  
and cast into the chest  until they had 
made an end  11and it was so  that at 
what time the chest was brought unto 
the king s officers by the hand of the 
levites  and when they saw that there 
was much money  the king s scribe 
and the chief priest s officer came and 
emptied the chest  and took it  and 
carried it back to its place  thus they 
did day by day  and gathered money in 
abundance  12and the king and 
jehoiada gave it to such as did the 
work of the service of the house of the 
lord and they hired masons and 
carpenters to restore the house of the 
lord and also such as wrought iron 
and brass to repair the house of the 
lord 13so the workmen wrought  and 
the work was perfected by them  and 
they set up the house of god in its 
state and strengthened it  14and when 
they had made an end  they brought 
the rest of the money before the king 
and jehoiada  whereof were made 
vessels fo r the house of the lord even 
vessels wherewith to minister  and 
buckets  and pans  and vessels of gold 
and silver  and they offered burnt 
offerings in the house of the lord 
continually all the days of jehoiada   
15but jehoiada waxed old and was 
full of da ys and he died  a hundred 
and thirty years old was he when he 
died 16and they buried him in the city 
of david among the kings  because he 
had done good in israel  and toward 24 second chronicles  
1333  
 god and his house  17now after the 
death of jehoiada came the princes of 
judah  and prostrated themselves 
before the king  then the king 
hearkened unto them  18and they 
forsook the house of the lord the god 
of their fathers  and served the 
asherim and the idols  and wrath came 
upon judah and jerusalem for this 
their guiltiness  19yet he sent prophets 
to them  to bring them back unto the 
lord and they admonished them  but 
they would not give ear   
20and the spirit of god clothed 
zechariah the son of jehoiada the 
priest  and he stood above the people  
and said unto them  thus saith go d 
why transgress ye the commandments 
of the lord that ye cannot prosper  
because ye have forsaken the lord he 
hath also forsaken you  21and they 
conspired against him  and stoned him 
with stones at the commandment of 
the king in the court of the house of 
the lord 22thus joash the king 
remembered not the kindness which 
jehoiada his father had done to him  
but slew his son  and when he died  he 
said the lord look upon it  and 
require it   
23and it came to pass  when the year 
was come about  that the a rmy of the 
arameans came up against him  and 
they came to judah and jerusalem  and 
destroyed all the princes of the people 
from among the people  and sent all 
the spoil of them unto the king of 
damascus  24for the army of the 
arameans came with a small com pany of men  and the lord delivered a very 
great host into their hand  because they 
had forsaken the lord the god of 
their fathers  so they executed 
judgment upon joash  25and when 
they were departed from him for 
they left him in great diseases his 
own se rvants conspired against him for 
the blood of the sons of jehoiada the 
priest  and slew him on his bed  and he 
died and they buried him in the city of 
david  but they buried him not in the 
sepulchres of the kings  26and these 
are they that conspired again st him  
zabad the son of shimeath the 
ammonitess  and jehozabad the son of 
shimrith the moabitess  27now 
concerning his sons  and the multitude 
of the burdens against him  and the 
rebuilding of the house of god  
behold  they are written in the 
commentary o f the book of the kings  
and amaziah his son reigned in his 
stead   
amaziah was twenty and five 
years old when he began to 
reign  and he reigned twenty and nine 
years in jerusalem  and his mother s 
name was jehoaddan of jerusalem  
2and he did that which  was right in the 
eyes of the lord but not with a whole 
heart  3now it came to pass  when the 
kingdom was established unto him  
that he slew his servants who had 
killed the king his father  4but he put 
not their children to death  but did 
according to tha t which is written in 
the law in the book of moses  as the 
lord commanded  saying  the fathers 25 second chronicles  
1334  
 shall not die for the children  neither 
shall the children die for the fathers  
but every man shall die for his own 
sin  
5moreover amaziah gathered judah 
together and ordered them according 
to their fathers houses  under captains 
of thousands and captains of hundreds  
even all judah and benjamin  and he 
numbered them from twenty years old 
and upward  and found them three 
hundred thousand chosen men  able to 
go forth to war  that could handle 
spear and shield  6he hired also a 
hundred thousand mighty men of 
valour out of israel for a hundred 
talents of silver  7but there came a man 
of god to him  saying  o king  let not 
the army of israel go with thee  for the 
lord is not with israel  even with all 
the children of ephraim  8but if thou 
wilt go  and do engage never so 
valiantly in battle  god will cast thee 
down before the enemy  for god hath 
power to help  and to cast down  9and 
amaziah said to the man of god  but 
what shall we do for the hundred 
talents which i have given to the army 
of israel  and the man of god 
answered  the lord is able to give 
thee much more than this  10then 
amaziah separated them  to wit  the 
army that was come to him out of 
ephraim  to go back home  wherefore 
their anger was greatly kindled against 
judah  and they returned home in 
fierce anger   
11and amaziah took courage  and 
led forth his people  and went to the valley of salt  and smote of the 
children of seir ten thousand  12and 
other ten thousand did the children of 
judah carry away alive  and brought 
them unto the top of the rock  and cast 
them down from the top of the rock  
that they all were broken in pieces  
13but the men of the army whom 
amaziah sent back  that they should 
not go with him to battle  fell upon the 
cities of judah  from samaria even 
unto beth horon  and smote of them 
three thousand  and took much spoil   
14now it came to pass  after that 
amaziah was come from the slaughter 
of the edomites  that he brought the 
gods of the children of seir  and set 
them up to be his gods  and prostrated 
himself before them  and offered unto 
them  15wherefore the anger of the 
lord was kindled against amaziah  
and he sent unto him a prophet  who 
said unto him  why hast thou sought 
after the gods of the people  which 
have not delivered their own people 
out of thy hand  16and it came to 
pass as he talked with him  that the 
king said unto him  have we made 
thee of the king s counsel  forbear  
why shouldest thou be smitten  then 
the prophet forbore  and said  i know 
that god hath determined to destroy 
thee because thou hast done this  and 
hast not hearkened unto my counsel   
17then amaziah king of judah took 
advice  and sent to joash  the son of 
jehoahaz the son of jehu  king of 
israel  saying  come  let us look one 
another in the face  18and joash king second chronicles  
1335  
 of israel sent to amaziah king of 
judah  saying  the thistle that was in 
lebanon sent to the cedar that was in 
lebanon  saying  give thy daughter to 
my son to wife  and there pa ssed by 
the wild beasts that were in lebanon  
and trod down the thistle  19thou 
sayest lo thou hast smitten edom  
will thy heart therefore lift thee up to 
glory therein  abide now at home  why 
shouldest thou meddle with evil  that 
thou shouldest fall  even thou  and 
judah with thee  20but amaziah 
would not hear  for it was of god  that 
he might deliver them into the hand 
of their enemies  because they had 
sought after the gods of edom  21so 
joash king of israel went up  and he 
and amaziah king of judah looked one 
another in the face at beth shemesh  
which belongeth to judah  22and judah 
was put to the worse before israel  and 
they fled every man to his tent  23and 
joash king of israel took amaziah 
king of judah  the son of joash  the 
son of jehoahaz  at beth shemesh  and 
brought him to jerusalem  and broke 
down the wall of jerusalem from the 
gate of ephraim unto the corner gate  
four hundred cubits  24and he took  
all the gold and silver  and all the 
vessels that were found in the house of 
god with obed edom  and the 
treasures of the king s house  the 
hostages also  and returned to samaria   
25and amaziah the son of joash 
king of judah lived after the death of 
joash son of jehoahaz king of israel 
fifteen years  26now the rest of the acts of amaziah  first and last  behold  are 
they not written in the book of the 
kings of judah and israel  27now from 
the time that amaziah did turn away 
from following the lord they made a 
conspiracy against him in jerusalem  
and he fled to lachish  but they sent 
after him to  lachish  and slew him 
there  28and they brought him upon 
horses  and buried him with his fathers 
in the city of judah   
and all the people of judah 
took uzziah  who was sixteen 
years old  and made him king in the 
room of his father amaziah  2he built 
eloth and restored it to judah  after 
that the king slept with his fathers  
3sixteen years old was uzziah when he 
began to reign  and he reigned fifty 
and two years in jerusalem  and his 
mother s name was jecoliah of 
jerusalem  4and he did that  which 
was right in the eyes of the lord 
according to all that his father 
amaziah had done  5and he set 
himself to seek god in the days of 
zechariah  who had understanding in 
the vision of god  and as long as he 
sought the lord god made him to 
prosper   
6and he wen t forth and warred 
against the philistines  and broke down 
the wall of gath  and the wall of 
jabneh  and the wall of ashdod  and 
he built cities in the country of  
ashdod  and among the philistines  
7and god helped him against the 
philistines  and against  the arabians 
that dwelt in gur baal and the 26 second chronicles  
1336  
 meunim  8and the ammonites gave 
gifts to uzziah  and his name spread 
abroad even to the entrance of egypt  
for he waxed exceeding strong  
9moreover uzziah built towers in 
jerusalem at the corner gate  and at th e 
valley gate  and at the turning  and 
fortified them  10and be built towers in 
the wilderness  and hewed out many 
cisterns  for he had much cattle  in the 
lowland also  and in the table land 
and he had husbandmen and 
vinedressers in the mountains and in 
the fruitful fields  for he loved 
husbandry   
11moreover uzziah had an army of 
fighting men  that went out to war by 
bands  according to the number of 
their reckoning made by jeiel the 
scribe and maaseiah the officer  under 
the hand of hananiah  one of the  
kings captains  12the whole number 
of the heads of fathers houses  even 
the mighty men of valour  was two 
thousand and six hundred  13and under 
their hand was a trained army  three 
hundred thousand and seven thousand 
and five hundred  that made war with 
mighty power  to help the king against 
the enemy  14and uzziah prepared for 
them  even for all the host  shields  and 
spears  and helmets  and coats of mail  
and bows  and stones for slinging  
15and he made in jerusalem engines  
invented by skilful men  to be on the 
towers and upon the corners  
wherewith to shoot arrows and great 
stones  and his name spread far abroad  for he was marvellously 
helped  till he was strong   
16but when he was strong  his heart 
was lifted up so that he did corruptly  
and he tres passed against the lord his 
god for he went into the temple of the 
lord to burn incense upon the altar of 
incense  17and azariah the priest went 
in after him  and with him fourscore 
priests of the lord that were valiant 
men 18and they withstood uzziah t he 
king and said unto him  it pertaineth 
not unto thee  uzziah  to burn incense 
unto the lord but to the priests the 
sons of aaron that are consecrated it 
pertaineth to burn incense  go out of 
the sanctuary  for thou hast trespassed  
neither shall it be  for thy honour from 
the lord god 19then uzziah was 
wroth  and he had a censer in his hand 
to burn incense  and while he was 
wroth with the priests  the leprosy 
broke forth in his forehead before the 
priests in the house of the lord beside 
the altar of incense  20and azariah the 
chief priest  and all the priests  looked 
upon him  and behold  he was leprous 
in his forehead  and they thrust him 
out quickly from thence  yea himself 
made haste also to go out  because the 
lord had smitten him  21and uzziah 
the king was a leper unto the day of his 
death  and dwelt in a house set apart  
being a leper  for he was cut off from 
the house of the lord and jotham his 
son was over the king s house  judging 
the people of the land  22now the rest 
of the acts of uzziah  first and last  did 
isaiah the prophet  the son of amoz  second chronicles  
1337  
 write  23so uzziah slept with his 
fathers  and they buried him with his 
fathers in the field of burial which 
belonged to the kings  for they said  
he is a leper  and jotham his son 
reigned in his  stead   
jotham was twenty and five 
years old when he began to 
reign  and he reigned sixteen years in 
jerusalem  and his mother s name was 
jerushah the daughter of zadok  2and 
he did that which was right in the eyes 
of the lord according to all that hi s 
father uzziah had done  howbeit he 
entered not into the temple of the 
lord and the people did yet 
corruptly  3he built the upper gate of 
the house of the lord and on the wall 
of ophel he built much  4moreover he 
built cities in the hill country of juda h 
and in the forest he built castles and 
towers  5he fought also with the king 
of the children of ammon  and 
prevailed against them  and the 
children of ammon gave him the same 
year a hundred talents of silver  and 
ten thousand measures of wheat  and 
ten thousand of barley  so much did 
the children of ammon render unto 
him in the second year also  and in the 
third  6so jotham became mighty  
because he ordered his ways before the 
lord his god  7now the rest of the acts 
of jotham  and all his wars  and his 
ways  behold  they are written in the 
book of the kings of israel and judah  
8he was five and twenty years old 
when he began to reign  and reigned 
sixteen years in jerusalem  9and jotham slept with his fathers  and they 
buried him in the city of david  and 
ahaz his son reigned in his stead   
ahaz was twenty years old 
when he began to reign  and 
he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem  
and he did not that which was right in 
the eyes of the lord like david his 
father  2but he walked in the ways of 
the kings  of israel  and made also 
molten images for the baalim  
3moreover he offered in the valley of 
the son of hinnom  and burnt his 
children in the fire  according to the 
abominations of the heathen  whom 
the lord cast out before the children 
of israel  4and he  sacrificed and 
offered in the high places  and on the 
hills and under every leafy tree  
5wherefore the lord his god delivered 
him into the hand of the king of aram  
and they smote him  and carried away 
of his a great multitude of captives  
and brought th em to damascus  and 
he was also delivered into the hand of 
the king of israel  who smote him with 
a great slaughter  6for pekah the son of 
remaliah slew in judah a hundred and 
twenty thousand in one day  all of 
them valiant men  because they had 
forsaken t he lord the god of their 
fathers  7and zichri  a mighty man of 
ephraim  slew maaseiah the king s 
son and azrikam the ruler of the 
house  and elkanah that was next to 
the king  8and the children of israel 
carried away captive of their brethren 
two hundred  thousand women  sons 
and daughters  and took also away 27 28 second chronicles  
1338  
 much spoil from them  and brought the 
spoil to samaria   
9but a prophet of the lord was 
there  whose name was oded  and he 
went out to meet the host that came to 
samaria  and said unto them  behold  
because the lord the god of your 
fathers  was wroth with judah  he hath 
delivered them into your hand  and ye 
have slain them in a rage which hath 
reached up unto heaven  10and now ye 
purpose to bring the children of judah 
and jerusalem into subjection f or 
bondmen and bondwomen unto you  
but are there not even with you acts of 
guilt of your own against the lord 
your god  11now hear me therefore  
and send back the captives  that ye 
have taken captive of your brethren  
for the fierce wrath of the lord is up on 
you 12then certain of the heads of the 
children of ephraim  azariah the son 
of jehohanan  berechiah the son of 
meshillemoth  and jehizkiah the son 
of shallum  and amasa the son of 
hadlai  stood up against them that 
came from the war  13and said unto 
them ye shall not bring in the 
captives hither  for ye purpose that 
which will bring upon us guilt against 
the lord to add unto our sins and to 
our guilt  for our guilt is great  and 
there is fierce wrath against israel  
14so the armed men left the capt ives 
and the spoil before the princes and all 
the congregation  15and the men that 
have been mentioned by name rose up  
and took the captives  and with the 
spoil clothed all that were naked among them  and arrayed them  and 
shod them  and gave them to eat and to 
drink  and anointed them  and carried 
all the feeble of them upon asses  and 
brought them to jericho  the city of 
palm trees  unto their brethren  then 
they returned to samaria   
16at that time did king ahaz send 
unto the kings of assyria to help hi m 
17for again the edomites had come 
and smitten judah  and carried away 
captives  18the philistines also had 
invaded the cities of the lowland  and 
of the south of judah  and had taken 
beth shemesh  and aijalon  and 
gederoth  and soco with the towns 
there of and timnah with the towns 
thereof  gimzo also and the towns 
thereof  and they dwelt there  19for the 
lord brought judah low because of 
ahaz king of israel  for he had cast 
away restraint in judah  and acted 
treacherously against the lord 20and 
tillega thpilneser king of assyria 
came unto him  and distressed him  but 
strengthened him not  21for ahaz 
stripped the house of the lord and the 
house of the king and the princes  and 
gave thereof unto the king of assyria  
but it helped him not   
22and in the t ime of his distress did 
he act even more treacherously against 
the lord this same king ahaz  23for 
he sacrificed unto the gods of 
damascus  which smote him  and he 
said because the gods of the kings of 
aram helped them  therefore will i 
sacrifice to the m that they may help 
me but they were the ruin of him  second chronicles  
1339  
 and of all israel  24and ahaz gathered 
together the vessels of the house of 
god and cut in pieces the vessels of 
the house of god  and shut up the 
doors of the house of the lord and he 
made him al tars in every corner of 
jerusalem  25and in every city of 
judah he made high places to offer 
unto other gods  and provoked the 
lord the god of his fathers  26now 
the rest of his acts  and all his ways  
first and last  behold  they are written 
in the book of the kings of judah and 
israel  27and ahaz slept with his 
fathers  and they buried him in the 
city even in jerusalem  for they 
brought him not into the sepulchres of 
the kings of israel  and hezekiah his 
son reigned in his stead   
hezekiah began to r eign when 
he was five and twenty years 
old and he reigned nine and twenty 
years in jerusalem  and his mother s 
name was abijah the daughter of 
zechariah  2and he did that which was 
right in the eyes of the lord according 
to all that david his father had done  
3he in the first year of his reign  in the 
first month  opened the doors of the 
house of the lord and repaired them  
4and he brought in the priests and the 
levites  and gathered them together 
into the broad place on the east  5and 
said unto them  hear me  ye levites  
now sanctify yourselves  and sanctify 
the house of the lord the god of your 
fathers  and carry forth the filthiness 
out of the holy place  6for our fathers 
have acted treacherously  and done that which was evil in the sight of the 
lord our god  and have forsaken him  
and have turned away their faces from 
the habitation of the lord and turned 
their backs  7also they have shut up 
the doors of the porch  and put out the 
lamps  and have not burned incense 
nor offered burnt offerings in the  holy 
place unto the god of israel  
8wherefore the wrath of the lord was 
upon judah and jerusalem  and he 
hath delivered them to be a horror  an 
astonishment  and a hissing  as ye see 
with your eyes  9for lo our fathers 
have fallen by the sword  and our sons 
and our daughters and our wives are in 
captivity for this  10now it is in my 
heart to make a covenant with the 
lord the god of israel  that his fierce 
anger may turn away from us  11my 
sons be not now negligent  for the 
lord hath chosen you to stand  before 
him to minister unto him  and that ye 
should be his ministers  and offer unto 
him  
12then the levites arose  mahath 
the son of amasai  and joel the son of 
azariah  of the sons of the kohathites  
and of the sons of merari  kish the son 
of abdi  and azariah the son of 
jehallelel  and of the gershonites  joah 
the son of zimmah  and eden the son 
of joah  13and of the sons of elizaphan  
shimri and jeiel  and of the sons of 
asaph  zechariah and mattaniah  14and 
of the sons of heman  jehiel and 
shimei  and of the sons of jeduthun  
shemaiah and uzziel  15and they 
gathered their brethren  and sanctified 29 second chronicles  
1340  
 themselves  and went in  according to 
the commandment of the king by the 
words of the lord to cleanse the 
house of the lord 16and the priests 
went in unt o the inner part of the 
house of the lord to cleanse it  and 
brought out all the uncleanness that 
they found in the temple of the lord 
into the court of the house of the lord 
and the levites took it  to carry it out 
abroad to the brook kidron  17now 
they began on the first day of the first 
month to sanctify  and on the eighth 
day of the month came they to the 
porch of the lord and they sanctified 
the house of the lord in eight days  
and on the sixteenth day of the first 
month they made an end  18then the y 
went in to hezekiah the king within 
the palace  and said  we have 
cleansed all the house of the lord 
even the altar of burnt offering  with 
all the vessels thereof  and the table of 
showbread  with all the vessels 
thereof  19moreover all the vessels  
which king ahaz in his reign did cast 
away when he acted treacherously  
have we prepared and sanctified  and 
behold  they are before the altar of the 
lord  
20then hezekiah the king arose 
early  and gathered the princes of the 
city and went up to the h ouse of the 
lord 21and they brought seven 
bullocks  and seven rams  and seven 
lambs  and seven he goats  for a sin 
offering for the kingdom and for the 
sanctuary and for judah  and he 
commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of t he 
lord 22so they killed the bullocks  
and the priests received the blood  and 
dashed it against the altar  and they 
killed the rams  and dashed the blood 
against the altar  they killed also the 
lambs  and dashed the blood against 
the altar  23and they br ought near the 
hegoats for the sin offering before the 
king and the congregation  and they 
laid their hands upon them  24and the 
priests killed them  and they made a 
sinoffering with their blood upon the 
altar to make atonement for all israel  
for the k ing commanded that the 
burnt offering and the sin offering 
should be made for all israel   
25and he set the levites in the house 
of the lord with cymbals  with 
psalteries  and with harps  according to 
the commandment of david  and of 
gad the king s seer  and nathan the 
prophet  for the commandment was of 
the lord by his prophets  26and the 
levites stood with the instruments of 
david  and the priests with the 
trumpets  27and hezekiah commanded 
to offer the burnt offering upon the 
altar and when the burnt offering 
began  the song of the lord began 
also and the trumpets  together with 
the instruments of david king of 
israel  28and all the congregation 
prostrated themselves  and the singers 
sang and the trumpeters sounded  all 
this continued until the burnt offering 
was finished  29and when they had 
made an end of offering  the king and 
all that were present with him bowed second chronicles  
1341  
 themselves and prostrated themselves  
30moreover hezekiah the king and the 
princes commanded the levites to sing 
praises unto the lord with the words 
of david  and of asaph the seer  and 
they sang praises with gladness  and 
they bowed their heads and prostrated 
themselves   
31then hezekiah answered and said  
now ye have consecrated yourselves 
unto the lord come near and bring 
sacrifices and  thank offerings into the 
house of the lord and the 
congregation brought in sacrifices and 
thank offerings  and as many as were 
of a willing heart brought burnt 
offerings  32and the number of the 
burnt offerings  which the 
congregation brought  was three score 
and ten bullocks  a hundred rams  and 
two hundred lambs  all these were for 
a burnt offering to the lord 33and the 
consecrated things were six hundred 
oxen and three thousand sheep  34but 
the priests were too few  so that they 
could not flay all the  burnt offerings  
wherefore their brethren the levites 
did help them  till the work was ended  
and until the priests had sanctified 
themselves  for the levites were more 
upright in heart to sanctify themselves 
than the priests  35and also the burnt 
offerin gs were in abundance  with the 
fat of the peace offerings  and the 
drink offerings for every burnt 
offering  so the service of the house of 
the lord was firmly established  36and 
hezekiah rejoiced  and all the people  
because of that which god had prepared  for the people  for the thing 
was done suddenly   
and hezekiah sent to all israel 
and judah  and wrote letters 
also to ephraim and manasseh  that 
they should come to the house of the 
lord at jerusalem  to keep the 
passover unto the lord the god of 
israel 2for the king had taken counsel  
and his princes  and all the 
congregation in jerusalem  to keep the 
passover in the second month  3for 
they could not keep it at that time  
because the priests had not sanctified 
themselves in sufficient number  
neithe r had the people gathered 
themselves together to jerusalem  
4and the thing was right in the eyes of 
the king and of all the congregation  
5so they established a decree to make 
proclamation throughout all israel  
from beer sheba even to dan  that 
they shoul d come to keep the passover 
unto the lord the god of israel  at 
jerusalem  for they had not kept it in 
great numbers according as it is 
written   
6so the posts went with the letters 
from the king and his princes 
throughout all israel and judah  and 
accord ing to the commandment of the 
king saying  ye children of israel  
turn back unto the lord the god of 
abraham  isaac  and israel  that he 
may return to the remnant that are 
escaped of you out of the hand of the 
kings of assyria  7and be not ye like 
your fathers  and like your brethren  
who acted treacherously against the 30 second chronicles  
1342  
 lord the god of their fathers  so that 
he delivered them to be an 
astonishment  as ye see  8now be ye 
not stiffnecked  as your fathers were  
but yield yourselves unto the lord 
and enter  into his sanctuary  which he 
hath sanctified for ever  and serve the 
lord your god  that his fierce anger 
may turn away from you  9for if ye 
turn back unto the lord your brethren 
and your children shall find 
compassion before them that led them 
captive  and shall come back into this 
land for the lord your god is 
gracious and merciful  and will not 
turn away his face from you  if ye 
return unto him   
10so the posts passed from city to 
city through the country of ephraim 
and manasseh  even unto zebulun  but 
they laughed them to scorn  and 
mocked them  11nevertheless divers of 
asher and manasseh and of zebulun 
humbled themselves  and came to 
jerusalem  12also in judah was the 
hand of god to give them one heart  to 
do the commandment of the king and 
of the p rinces by the word of the lord  
13and there assembled at jerusalem 
much people to keep the feast of 
unleavened bread in the second month  
a very great congregation  14and they 
arose and took away the altars that 
were in jerusalem  and all the altars 
for i ncense took they away  and cast 
them into the brook kidron  15then 
they killed the passover lamb on the 
fourteenth day of the second month  
and the priests and the levites were ashamed  and sanctified themselves  
and brought burnt offerings into the 
house of the lord 16and they stood in 
their place after their order  according 
to the law of moses the man of god  
the priests dashed the blood  which 
they received of the hand of the 
levites  17for there were many in the 
congregation that had not sanctified 
themselves  therefore the levites had 
the charge of killing the passover 
lambs for every one that was not clean  
to sanctify them unto the lord 18for a 
multitude of the people  even many of 
ephraim and manasseh  issachar and 
zebulun  had not cleansed themse lves 
yet did they eat the passover otherwise 
than it is written  for hezekiah had 
prayed for them  saying  the good 
lord pardon  19every one that setteth 
his heart to seek god  the lord the 
god of his fathers  though he be  not 
cleansed  according to t he 
purification that pertaineth to holy 
things  20and the lord hearkened to 
hezekiah  and healed the people  
21and the children of israel that were 
present at jerusalem kept the feast of 
unleavened bread seven days with 
great gladness  and the levites and  the 
priests praised the lord day by day  
singing with loud instruments unto the 
lord 22and hezekiah spoke 
encouragingly unto all the levites that 
were well skilled in the service of the 
lord so they did eat throughout the 
feast for the seven days  offer ing 
sacrifices of peace offerings  and second chronicles  
1343  
 giving thanks to the lord the god of 
their fathers   
23and the whole congregation took 
counsel to keep other seven days  and 
they kept other seven days with 
gladness  24for hezekiah king of judah 
did give to the cong regation for 
offerings a thousand bullocks and 
seven thousand sheep  and the princes 
gave to the congregation a thousand 
bullocks and ten thousand sheep  and 
priests sanctified themselves in great 
numbers  25and all the congregation of 
judah  with the prie sts and the levites  
and all the congregation that came out 
of israel  and the strangers that came 
out of the land of israel  and that dwelt 
in judah  rejoiced  26so there was great 
joy in jerusalem  for since the time of 
solomon the son of david king of 
israel there was not the like in 
jerusalem  27then the priests the 
levites arose and blessed the people  
and their voice was heard of the 
lord and their prayer came up to his 
holy habitation  even unto heaven   
now when all this was 
finished  all isra el that were 
present went out to the cities of judah  
and broke in pieces the pillars  and 
hewed down the asherim  and broke 
down the high places and the altars out 
of all judah and benjamin  in ephraim 
also and manasseh  until they had 
destroyed them all  then all the 
children of israel returned  every man 
to his possession  into their own cities   
2and hezekiah appointed the 
courses of the priest and the levites after their courses  every man 
according to his service  both the 
priests and the levites  for burnt 
offerings and for peace offerings  to 
minister  and to give thanks  and to 
praise in the gates of the camp of the 
lord 3he appointed also the king s 
portion of his substance for the burnt 
offerings  to wit  for the morning and 
evening burnt offerin gs and the burnt 
offerings for the sabbaths  and for the 
new moons  and for the appointed 
seasons  as it is written in the law of 
the lord 4moreover he commanded 
the people that dwelt in jerusalem to 
give the portion of the priests and the 
levites  that they might give 
themselves to the law of the lord 
5and as soon as the commandment 
came abroad  the children of israel 
gave in abundance the first fruits of 
corn wine  and oil  and honey  and of 
all the increase of the field  and the 
tithe of all things b rought they in 
abundantly  6and the children of israel 
and judah  that dwelt in the cities of 
judah  they also brought in the tithe of 
oxen and sheep  and the tithe of 
hallowed things which were hallowed 
unto the lord their god  and laid them 
by heaps  7in the third month they 
began to lay the foundation of the 
heaps  and finished them in the 
seventh month  8and when hezekiah 
and the princes came and saw the 
heaps  they blessed the lord and his 
people israel  9then hezekiah 
questioned the priests and the l evites 
concerning the heaps  10and azariah 31 second chronicles  
1344  
 the chief priest  of the house of zadok  
answered him and said  since the 
people began to bring the offerings 
into the house of the lord we have 
eaten and had enough  and have left 
plenty  for the lord hath bles sed his 
people  and that which is left is this 
great store   
11then hezekiah commanded to 
prepare chambers in the house of the 
lord and they prepared them  12and 
they brought in the offerings and the 
tithes and the hallowed things 
faithfully  and over th em conaniah the 
levite was ruler  and shimei his 
brother was second  13and jehiel  and 
azaziah  and nahath  and asahel  and 
jerimoth  and jozabad  and eliel  and 
ismachiah  and mahath  and benaiah  
were overseers under the hand of 
conaniah and shimei his b rother  by 
the appointment of hezekiah the king  
and azariah the ruler of the house of 
god 14and kore the son of imnah the 
levite  the porter at the east gate  was 
over the freewill offerings of god  to 
distribute the offerings of the lord 
and the most h oly things  15and under 
him were eden  and miniamin  and 
jeshua  and shemaiah  amariah  and 
shecaniah  in the cities of the priests  
in their office of trust  to give to their 
brethren by courses  as well to the 
great as to the small  16beside them 
that we re reckoned by genealogy of 
males  from three years old and 
upward  even every one that entered 
into the house of the lord for his 
daily portion  for their service in their charges according to their courses  
17and them that were reckoned by 
genealogy of the priests by their 
fathers houses  and the levites from 
twenty years old and upward  in their 
charges by their courses  18even to give 
to them that were reckoned by 
genealogy of all their little ones  their 
wives  and their sons  and their 
daughters  through all the 
congregation  for in their office of 
trust they administered the sacred 
gifts 19also for the sons of aaron the 
priests  that were in the fields of the 
open land about their cities  in every 
city there were men that were 
mentioned by name  to give portions to 
all the males among the priests  and to 
all that were reckoned by genealogy 
among the levites   
20and thus did hezekiah throughout 
all judah  and he wrought that which 
was good and right and faithful before 
the lord his god  21and in ever y work 
that he began in the service of the 
house of god  and in the law  and in 
the commandments  to seek his god  
he did it with all his heart  and 
prospered   
after these things  and this 
faithfulness  sennacherib king 
of assyria came  and entered int o 
judah  and encamped against the 
fortified cities  and thought to make a 
breach therein for himself  2and when 
hezekiah saw that sennacherib was 
come  and that he was purposed to 
fight against jerusalem  3he took 
counsel with his princes and his 32 second chronicles  
1345  
 mighty me n to stop the waters of the 
fountains which were without the city  
and they helped him  4so there was 
gathered much people together  and 
they stopped all the fountains  and the 
brook that flowed through the midst of 
the land  saying  why should the 
kings of assyria come  and find much 
water  5and he took courage  and 
built up all the wall that was broken 
down  and raised it up to the towers  
and another wall without  and 
strengthened millo in the city of 
david  and made weapons and shields 
in abundance  6and he set captains of 
war over the people  and gathered 
them together to him in the broad 
place at the gate of the city  and spoke 
encouragingly to them  saying  7be 
strong and of good courage  be not 
afraid nor dismayed for the king of 
assyria  nor for all the multitude that 
is with him  for there is a greater with 
us than with him  8with him is an arm 
of flesh  but with us is the lord our 
god to help us  and to fight our 
battles  and the people rested 
themselves upon the words of 
hezekiah king of judah   
9after this did sennacherib king of 
assyria send his servants to 
jerusalem now he was before 
lachish  and all his power with him 
unto hezekiah king of judah  and unto 
all judah that were at jerusalem  
saying  10thus saith sennacherib king 
of assyria  whereon do ye trust  that 
ye abide the siege in jerusalem  
11doth not hezekiah persuade you  to give you over to die by famine and by 
thirst  saying  the lord our god will 
deliver us out of the hand of the king 
of assyria  12hath not the same 
hezekiah taken  away his high places 
and his altars  and commanded judah 
and jerusalem  saying  ye shall 
worship before one altar  and upon it 
shall ye offer  13know ye not what i 
and my fathers have done unto all the 
peoples of the lands  were the gods of 
the nations of  the lands in any wise 
able to deliver their land out of my 
hand  14who was there among all the 
gods of those nations which my fathers 
utterly destroyed  that could deliver his 
people out of my hand  that your god 
should be able to deliver you out of 
my ha nd 15now therefore let not 
hezekiah beguile you  nor persuade 
you after this manner  neither believe 
ye him  for no god of any nation or 
kingdom was able to deliver his people 
out of my hand  and out of the hand of 
my fathers  how much less shall your 
god deliver you out of my hand   
16and his servants spoke yet more 
against the lord god and against his 
servant hezekiah  17he wrote also a 
letter  to taunt the lord the god of 
israel  and to speak against him  
saying  as the gods of the nations of 
the la nds which have not delivered 
their people out of my hand  so shall 
not the god of hezekiah deliver his 
people out of my hand  18and they 
cried with a loud voice in the 
jews language unto the people of 
jerusalem that were on the wall  to second chronicles  
1346  
 terrify them  and to affright them  that 
they might take the city  19and they 
spoke of the god of jerusalem  as of 
the gods of the peoples of the earth  
which are the work of men s hands   
20and hezekiah the king  and isaiah 
the prophet the son of amoz  prayed 
because of t his and cried to heaven  
21and the lord sent an angel  who cut 
off all the mighty men of valour  and 
the leaders and captains  in the camp 
of the king of assyria  so he returned 
with shame of face to his own land  
and when he was come into the house 
of hi s god  they that came forth of his 
own bowels slew him there with the 
sword  22thus the lord saved 
hezekiah and the inhabitants of 
jerusalem from the hand of 
sennacherib the king of assyria  and 
from the hand of all  and guided them 
on every side  23and ma ny brought 
gifts unto the lord to jerusalem  and 
precious things to hezekiah king of 
judah  so that he was exalted in the 
sight of all nations from thenceforth   
24in those days hezekiah was sick 
even unto death  and he prayed unto 
the lord and he spoke u nto him  and 
gave him a sign  25but hezekiah 
rendered not according to the benefit 
done unto him  for his heart was lifted 
up therefore there was wrath upon 
him and upon judah and jerusalem  
26notwithstanding hezekiah humbled 
himself for the pride of his  heart  both 
he and the inhabitants of jerusalem  so 
that the wrath of the lord came not 
upon them in the days of hezekiah   27and hezekiah had exceeding 
much riches and honour  and he 
provided him treasuries for silver  and 
for gold  and for precious ston es and 
for spices  and for shields  and for all 
manner of goodly vessels  28store 
houses also for the increase of corn  
and wine  and oil  and stalls for all 
manner of beasts  and flocks in folds  
29moreover he provided him cities  and 
possessions of floc ks and herds in 
abundance  for god had given him 
very much substance  30this same 
hezekiah also stopped the upper 
spring of the waters of gihon  and 
brought them straight down on the 
west side of the city of david  and 
hezekiah prospered in all his works  
31howbeit in the business of the 
ambassadors of the princes of 
babylon  who sent unto him to inquire 
of the wonder that was done in the 
land god left him  to try him  that he 
might know all that was in his heart   
32now the rest of the acts of 
hezekiah  and his good deeds  behold  
they are written in the vision of isaiah 
the prophet the son of amoz  and in 
the book of the kings of judah and 
israel  33and hezekiah slept with his 
fathers  and they buried him in the 
ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of 
david and all judah and the 
inhabitants of jerusalem did him 
honour at his death  and manasseh his 
son reigned in his stead   
manasseh was twelve years 
old when he began to reign  
and he reigned fifty and five years in 33 second chronicles  
1347  
 jerusalem  2and he did that which wa s 
evil in the sight of the lord after the 
abominations of the nations  whom the 
lord cast out before the children of 
israel  3for he built again the high 
places which hezekiah his father had 
broken down  and he reared up altars 
for the baalim  and made as heroth  
and worshipped all the host of heaven  
and served them  4and he built altars 
in the house of the lord whereof the 
lord said in jerusalem shall my 
name be for ever  5and he built altars 
for all the host of heaven in the two 
courts of the house o f the lord 6he 
also made his children to pass through 
the fire in the valley of the son of 
hinnom  and he practised soothsaying  
and used enchantments  and practised 
sorcery  and appointed them that 
divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit  
he wrought much  evil in the sight of 
the lord to provoke him  7and he set 
the graven image of the idol  which he 
had made  in the house of god  of 
which god said to david and to 
solomon his son  in this house  and in 
jerusalem  which i have chosen out of 
all the tribes  of israel  will i put my 
name for ever  8neither will i any more 
remove the foot of israel from off the 
land which i have appointed for your 
fathers  if only they will observe to do 
all that i have commanded them  even 
all the law and the statutes and the  
ordinances by the hand of moses  
9and manasseh made judah and the 
inhabitants of jerusalem to err  so that 
they did evil more than did the nations  whom the lord destroyed before the 
children of israel   
10and the lord spoke to manasseh  
and to his peopl e but they gave no 
heed  11wherefore the lord brought 
upon them the captains of the host of 
the king of assyria  who took 
manasseh with hooks  and bound him 
with fetters  and carried him to 
babylon  12and when he was in 
distress  he besought the lord his god 
and humbled himself greatly before 
the god of his fathers  13and he prayed 
unto him  and he was entreated of 
him and heard his supplication  and 
brought him back to jerusalem into his 
kingdom  then manasseh knew that 
the lord he was god   
14now after  this he built an outer 
wall to the city of david  on the west 
side of gihon  in the valley  even to 
the entrance at the fish gate  and he 
compassed about ophel  and raised it 
up a very great height  and he put 
captains of the army in all the fortified 
cities of judah  15and he took away the 
strange gods  and the idol out of the 
house of the lord and all the altars 
that he had built in the mount of the 
house of the lord and in jerusalem  
and cast them out of the city  16and he 
built up the altar of the lord and 
offered thereon sacrifices of peace 
offerings and of thanksgiving  and 
commanded judah to serve the lord 
the god of israel  17nevertheless the 
people did sacrifice still in the high 
places  but only unto the lord their 
god  second chronicles  
1348  
 18now the rest of the acts of 
manasseh  and his prayer unto his 
god and the words of the seers that 
spoke to him in the name of the lord 
the god of israel  behold  they are 
written among the acts of the kings of 
israel  19his prayer also  and how 
god was entreated of him  and all his 
sin and his transgression  and the 
places wherein he built high places  
and set up the asherim and the graven 
images  before he humbled himself  
behold  they are written in the history 
of the seers  20so manasseh slept with 
his fathers  and they  buried him in his 
own house  and amon his son reigned 
in his stead   
21amon was twenty and two years 
old when he began to reign  and he 
reigned two years in jerusalem  22and 
he did that which was evil in the sight 
of the lord as did manasseh his 
father  and amon sacrificed unto all 
the graven images which manasseh his 
father had made  and served them  
23and he humbled not himself before 
the lord as manasseh his father had 
humbled himself  but this same amon 
became guilty more and more  24and 
his servants  conspired against him  and 
put him to death in his own house  
25but the people of the land slew all 
them that had conspired against king 
amon  and the people of the land 
made josiah his son king in his stead   
josiah was eight years old 
when he began t o reign  and 
he reigned thirty and one years in 
jerusalem  2and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and 
walked in the ways of david his 
father  and turned not aside to the right 
hand or to the left  3for in the eighth 
year of his reign  while he was yet 
young  he began to seek after the god 
of david his father  and in the twelfth 
year he began to purge judah and 
jerusalem from the high places  and 
the asherim  and the graven images  
and the molten images  4and they 
broke down the altars of the baalim in 
his presence  and the sun images  that 
were on high above them  he hewed 
down  and the asherim  and the 
graven images  and the molten images  
he broke in pieces  and made dust of 
them  and strewed it upon the graves 
of them that had sacrifice d unto them  
5and he burnt the bones of the priests 
upon their altars  and purged judah 
and jerusalem  6and so did he in the 
cities of manasseh and ephraim and 
simeon  even unto naphtali  with their 
axes round about  7and he broke down 
the altars  and beat  the asherim and 
the graven images into powder  and 
hewed down all the sun images 
throughout all the land of israel  and 
returned to jerusalem   
8now in the eighteenth year of his 
reign  when he had purged the land  
and the house  he sent shaphan the son 
of azaliah  and maaseiah the governor 
of the city  and joah the son of joahaz 
the recorder  to repair the house of the 
lord his god  9and they came to 
hilkiah the high priest  and delivered 
the money that was brought into the 34 second chronicles  
1349  
 house of god  which the levites  the 
keepers of the door  had gathered of 
the hand of manasseh and ephraim  
and of all the remnant of israel  and of 
all judah and benjamin  and they 
returned to jerusalem  10and they 
delivered it into the hand of the 
workmen that had the oversight of the  
house of the lord and the workmen 
that wrought in the house of the lord 
gave it to mend and repair the house  
11even to the carpenters and to the 
builders gave they it  to buy hewn 
stone  and timber for couplings  and to 
make beams for the houses which t he 
kings of judah had destroyed  12and 
the men did the work faithfully  and 
the overseers of them were jahath and 
obadiah  the levites  of the sons of 
merari  and zechariah and meshullam  
of the sons of the kohathites  to 
preside over it  and other of the 
levites  all that had skill with 
instruments of music  13also they were 
over the bearers of burdens  and 
presided over all that did the work in 
every manner of service  and of the 
levites there were scribes  and 
officers  and porters   
14and when they brou ght out the 
money that was brought into the house 
of the lord hilkiah the priest found 
the book of the law of the lord given 
by moses  15and hilkiah answered and 
said to shaphan the scribe  i have 
found the book of the law in the 
house of the lord and hilkiah 
delivered the book to shaphan  16and 
shaphan carried the book to the king  and moreover brought back word unto 
the king  saying  all that was 
committed to thy servants  they do it  
17and they have poured out the money 
that was found in the house o f the 
lord and have delivered it into the 
hand of the overseers  and into the 
hand of the workmen  18and shaphan 
the scribe told the king  saying  
hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a 
book  and shaphan read therein 
before the king  19and it came to p ass 
when the king had heard the words of 
the law  that he rent his clothes  20and 
the king commanded hilkiah  and 
ahikam the son of shaphan  and 
abdon the son of micah  and shaphan 
the scribe  and asaiah the king s 
servant  saying  21go ye  inquire of 
the lord for me  and for them that are 
left in israel and in judah  concerning 
the words of the book that is found  for 
great is the wrath of the lord that is 
poured out upon us  because our 
fathers have not kept the word of the 
lord to do according unto al l that is 
written in this book   
22so hilkiah  and they whom the 
king had commanded  went to 
huldah the prophetess  the wife of 
shallum the son of tokhath  the son of 
hasrah  keeper of the wardrobe now 
she dwelt in jerusalem in the second 
quarter and th ey spoke to her to that 
effect  23and she said unto them  
thus saith the lord the god of 
israel  tell ye the man that sent you 
unto me  24thus saith the lord 
behold  i will bring evil upon this second chronicles  
1350  
 place  and upon the inhabitants 
thereof  even all the curse s that are 
written in the book which they have 
read before the king of judah  
25because they have forsaken me  and 
have offered unto other gods  that they 
might provoke me with all the works 
of their hands  therefore is my wrath 
poured out upon this place  and it shall 
not be quenched  26but unto the king 
of judah  who sent you to inquire of 
the lord thus shall ye say to him  
thus saith the lord the god of israel  
as touching the words which thou hast 
heard  27because thy heart was tender  
and thou didst humble thyself before 
god when thou heardest his words 
against this place  and against the 
inhabitants thereof  and hast humbled 
thyself before me  and hast rent thy 
clothes  and wept before me  i also 
have heard thee  saith the lord 
28behold  i will gat her thee to thy 
fathers  and thou shalt be gathered to 
thy grave in peace  neither shall thine 
eyes see all the evil that i will bring 
upon this place  and upon the 
inhabitants thereof  and they brought 
back word unto the king   
29then the king sent and g athered 
together all the elders of judah and 
jerusalem  30and the king went up to 
the house of the lord and all the men 
of judah and the inhabitants of 
jerusalem  and the priests  and the 
levites  and all the people  both great 
and small  and he read in t heir ears all 
the words of the book of the covenant 
that was found in the house of the lord 31and the king stood in his 
place  and made a covenant before the 
lord to walk after the lord and to 
keep his commandments  and his 
testimonies  and his statutes  with all 
his heart  and with all his soul  to 
perform the words of the covenant that 
were written in this book  32and he 
caused all that were found in 
jerusalem and benjamin to stand to it  
and the inhabitants of jerusalem did 
according to the covenant o f god  the 
god of their fathers  33and josiah took 
away all the abominations out of all 
the countries that pertained to the 
children of israel  and made all that 
were found in israel to serve  even to 
serve the lord their god  all his days 
they departed no t from following the 
lord the god of their fathers   
and josiah kept a passover 
unto the lord in jerusalem  
and they killed the passover lamb on 
the fourteenth day of the first month  
2and he set the priests in their charges  
and encouraged them to the  service of 
the house of the lord 3and he said 
unto the levites that taught all israel  
that were holy unto the lord put the 
holy ark in the house which solomon 
the son of david king of israel did 
build  there shall no more be a burden 
upon your shoulde rs now serve the 
lord your god  and his people israel  
4and prepare ye after your 
fathers houses by your courses  
according to the writing of david king 
of israel  and according to the writing 
of solomon his son  5and stand in the 35 second chronicles  
1351  
 holy place according to the divisions 
of the fathers houses of your brethren 
the children of the people  and let 
there be for each  a portion of a 
father s house of the levites  6and kill 
the passover lamb  and sanctify 
yourselves  and prepare for your 
brethren  to do according to the word 
of the lord by the hand of moses   
7and josiah gave to the children of 
the people  of the flock  lambs and 
kids all of them for the passover 
offerings  unto all that were present  to 
the number of thirty thousand  and 
three thousand bullocks  these were of 
the king s substance  8and his princes 
gave willingly unto the people  to the 
priests  and to the levites  hilkiah and 
zechariah and jehiel  the rulers of the 
house of god  gave unto the priests for 
the passover offerings two thousand 
and si x hundred small cattle  and 
three hundred oxen  9conaniah also  
and shemaiah and nethanel  his 
brethren  and hashabiah and jeiel and 
jozabad  the chiefs of the levites  
gave unto the levites for the passover 
offerings five thousand small cattle  
and fi ve hundred oxen   
10so the service was prepared  and 
the priests stood in their place  and the 
levites by their courses  according to 
the king s commandment  11and they 
killed the passover lamb  and the 
priests dashed the blood  which they 
received  of their hand  and the levites 
flayed them  12and they removed the 
portions that were to be burnt  that 
they might give them to the divisions of the fathers houses of the children of 
the people  to present unto the lord as 
it is written in the book of moses  and 
so did they with the oxen  13and they 
roasted the passover with fire 
according to the ordinance  and the 
holy offerings sod they in pots  and in 
caldrons  and in pans  and carried them 
quickly to all the children of the 
people  14and afterward they prep ared 
for themselves  and for the priests  
because the priests the sons of aaron 
were busied in offering the portions 
that were to be burnt and the fat until 
night  therefore the levites prepared 
for themselves  and for the priests the 
sons of aaron  15and the singers the 
sons of asaph were in their place  
according to the commandment of 
david  and asaph  and heman  and 
jeduthun the king s seer  and the 
porters were at every gate  they needed 
not to depart from their service  for 
their brethren the levites p repared for 
them   
16so all the service of the lord was 
prepared the same day  to keep the 
passover  and to offer burnt offerings 
upon the altar of the lord according 
to the commandment of king josiah  
17and the children of israel that were 
present kept t he passover at that time  
and the feast of unleavened bread 
seven days  18and there was no 
passover like to that kept in israel from 
the days of samuel the prophet  
neither did any of the kings of israel 
keep such a passover as josiah kept  
and the priests  and the levites  and all second chronicles  
1352  
 judah and israel that were present  and 
the inhabitants of jerusalem  19in the 
eighteenth year of the reign of josiah 
was this passover kept   
20after all this  when josiah had 
prepared the temple  neco king of 
egypt went up to f ight against 
carchemish by the euphrates  and 
josiah went out against him  21but he 
sent ambassadors to him  saying  
what have i to do with thee  thou 
king of judah  i come not against thee 
this day  but against the house 
wherewith i have war  and god hat h 
given command to speed me  forbear 
thee from meddling with god  who is 
with me  that he destroy thee not  
22nevertheless josiah would not turn 
his face from him  but disguised 
himself  that he might fight with him  
and hearkened not unto the words of 
neco from the mouth of god  and 
came to fight in the valley of megiddo  
23and the archers shot at king josiah  
and the king said to his servants  
have me away  for i am sore 
wounded  24so his servants took him 
out of the chariot  and put him in the 
second  chariot that he had  and 
brought him to jerusalem  and he died  
and was buried in the sepulchres of his 
fathers  and all judah and jerusalem 
mourned for josiah  25and jeremiah 
lamented for josiah  and all the 
singing men and singing women spoke 
of josiah in their lamentations  unto 
this day  and they made them an 
ordinance in israel  and behold  they 
are written in the lamentations  26now the rest of the acts of josiah  and his 
good deeds  according to that which is 
written in the law of the lord 27and 
his acts  first and last  behold  they are 
written in the book of the kings of 
israel and judah   
then the people of the land 
took jehoahaz the son of 
josiah  and made him king in his 
father s stead in jerusalem  2joahaz 
was twenty and three years old wh en 
he began to reign  and he reigned three 
months in jerusalem  3and the king of 
egypt deposed him at jerusalem  and 
fined the land a hundred talents of 
silver and a talent of gold  4and the 
king of egypt made eliakim his 
brother king over judah and 
jerusa lem and changed his name to 
jehoiakim  and neco took joahaz his 
brother  and carried him to egypt   
5jehoiakim was twenty and five 
years old when he began to reign  and 
he reigned eleven years in jerusalem  
and he did that which was evil in the 
sight of t he lord his god  6against 
him came up nebuchadnezzar king of 
babylon  and bound him in fetters  to 
carry him to babylon  
7nebuchadnezzar also carried of the 
vessels of the house of the lord to 
babylon  and put them in his temple at 
babylon  8now the rest o f the acts of 
jehoiakim  and his abominations 
which he did  and that which was 
found in him  behold  they are written 
in the book of the kings of israel and 
judah  and jehoiachin his son reigned 
in his stead   36 second chronicles  
1353  
 9jehoiachin was eight years old 
when he began to reign  and he 
reigned three months and ten days in 
jerusalem  and he did that which was 
evil in the sight of the lord 10and at 
the return of the year king 
nebuchadnezzar sent  and brought him 
to babylon  with the goodly vessels of 
the house of the lord and made 
zedekiah his brother king over judah 
and jerusalem   
11zedekiah was twenty and one 
years old when he began to reign  and 
he reigned eleven years in jerusalem  
12and he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the lord his god  he humbled 
not hims elf before jeremiah the 
prophet speaking from the mouth of 
the lord 13and he also rebelled 
against king nebuchadnezzar  who had 
made him swear by god  but he 
stiffened his neck  and hardened his 
heart from turning unto the lord the 
god of israel  14moreo ver all the 
chiefs of the priests  and the people  
transgressed very greatly after all the 
abominations of the nations  and they 
polluted the house of the lord which 
he had hallowed in jerusalem  15and 
the lord the god of their fathers  sent 
to them by hi s messengers  sending 
betimes and often  because he had 
compassion on his people  and on his 
dwelling place  16but they mocked the 
messengers of god  and despised his 
words  and scoffed at his prophets  
until the wrath of the lord arose 
against his people  till there was no 
remedy   17therefore he brought upon them 
the king of the chaldeans  who slew 
their young men with the sword in the 
house of their sanctuary  and had no 
compassion upon young man or 
maiden  old man or hoary headed  he 
gave them all into his hand  18and all 
the vessels of the house of god  great 
and small  and the treasures of the 
house of the lord and the treasures of 
the king  and of his princes  all these 
he brought to babylon  19and they 
burnt the house of god  and broke 
down the wall  of jerusalem  and burnt 
all the palaces thereof with fire  and 
destroyed all the goodly vessels 
thereof  20and them that had escaped 
from the sword carried he away to 
babylon  and they were servants to 
him and his sons until the reign of the 
kingdom of pe rsia 21to fulfil the word 
of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah  
until the land had been paid her 
sabbaths  for as long as she lay 
desolate she kept sabbath  to fulfil 
threescore and ten years   
22now in the first year of cyrus king 
of persia  that the wor d of the lord by 
the mouth of jeremiah might be 
accomplished  the lord stirred up the 
spirit of cyrus king of persia  that he 
made a proclamation throughout all his 
kingdom  and put it also in writing  
saying  23thus saith cyrus king of 
persia  all the ki ngdoms of the earth 
hath the lord the god of heaven  
given me  and he hath charged me to 
build him a house in jerusalem  which 
is in judah  whosoever there is among second chronicles  
1354  
 you of all his people the lord his 
god be with him let him go up
