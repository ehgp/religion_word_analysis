[it known process agreement difference false perception etc . arise defects,and qualities self.] objection: asserted case, ignorance quality knower? reply: no, defects blindness seen belong eye n organ. notion 'ignorance quality511 experiencer, fact possessed quality ignorance constitutes mundane state knower field; assertion made (by vedantin) n connection, "that knower th field god mundane being, " improper,' - so. example: since defects false perception etc. seen belong organ eye, therefore false perception etc. thei r causes, viz defects like blindness etc., belong perceiver. blindness eyes pertain perceiver since curved treatment seen perceiver, similarly notions like non -perception, false perception, doubt, causes should, cases, pertain organ; perceiver, knower field. since objects perception, qualities knower way light lamp. cause objects perception, cognized different one's self. besides, denied schools thought liberation, organs depart, association defects ignorance etc. ( defects) qualities self itself, knower field, heat fire, never dissociation them. again, since512 association dissociation anything immutable, formless self wh ich - pervading like space, therefore established knower field ever identical god. follows alos utternance lord, 'being without beginning without qualities' (31), etc. objection: well, so, then, owing nonexistence world mundane creatures, arise defect uselessness scriptures, etc. reply: no, since (defect) admitted all. defect admitted believe self explained one alone! objection: admitted all? reply: people schools thought believe self admit worldly behaviour behaviour worldling liberated ones. yet, case (i.e. various schools), admitted possibility defect scriptures becoming useless, etc. similarly, case let scriptures useless knowers field become identified god; purposeful within sphere ignorance. case dualists, admitted scriptures etc. become useful state bondage, state liberation. objection: well, us dualists, bonda ge513 liberation self real truest sense. so, things renounced accepted also means thereto real, scriptures etc. become meaningful. hand, may non -dualists, since duality deo exist truest sense, creation ignorance, therefore state bondage self ultimately real, hence scriptures etc. become purposeless remain shorn subject -matter? reply: no, since logica l self different states. possible all, states bondage freedom self simultaneous, successive. that, cannot occur simultaneously, since contradictory -like rest otion object. occur successively without caused, arise contingency liberation; occur cause, then, since exist inherently, arises contingency ultimately unreal. case also assumption becomes falsified. moreover, ascertaining precedence succession states bondage liberation, state bondage considered earlier beginning, end. contrary valid means514 knowledge. similarly admitted state liberation beginning, end- certainly opposed valid means knowledge. possi ble established eternality something states nd undergoes change one state another. hand, avoiding defect non - eternality different states bondage liberation assumed, then, even dualists defects purposelessness scriptures become certainly unavoidable. thus, situation similar (for both), advaitin (alone) refute objection. scriptures become purposeless, scriptures applicable commonly known unenlightened person. indeed case ignorant person -not case enlightened one-that occurs perception identity self effect (i.e. enjoyership) cause (i.e. agentship) -self. for, case enlightened persons, impossible that, dawn realization non - identity self effect cause, self identification 'i'. surely, even downright fool, lunatic others, see water fire shade light identical; speak discriminating person!515 therefore, case, scriptures dealing injunction prohibition concern per son sees distinction self effect cause. for, devadatta ordered som work words, 'you this,' visnumitra happens not, even hearing command, conclude, 'i ordered.' conclusion reasonable person order meant understood. also regard cause effect. objection: that, even realized self different effect cuase, quite reasonable standpoint natural relationship, [natural relationship -self- identification body ignorance.] regard scriptures one understanding, 'i enjoined adotp means yields desired result, nd porhibited adopting means leads undesirable result'? instance, case father son, others, even though exists awareness distinction other, still comprehensi implication injunctions prohibitions meant one also meant other. [in (br. (1.5.17) read, 'now therefore entrusting:516 man thinks die, says son, "you brahman, sacrif ice, world,"' etc. enjoined manner son accept duties thus entrusted father. similarly, understood son unable perform duties, fathe r accept them. also case brothers others. thus, case enlightened person also, though comprehension distinction effect cause, still, owing earlier relationship ignorance, body, etc., contradiction understanding injunctions prohibitions meant him.] reply: no, since identification self effect cause possible attaining knowledge self distinct (from them). one followed (or eschewed) enjoined prohibited scriptures comprehends distinction effect cause; before. [in b.s. (3.4.26 -7) said merit earned performance f scriptural duties helps generate knowledge brahman. therefore duties meant enlightened. (by following enjoined, avoiding prohibited, one's mind becomes purified, one517 understands differen cause effect - agentship enjoyership. -tr.)] therefore established scriptures dealing injunctions prohibitions meant ignorant. objection: well, (injunctions prohibitions) as, 'one desires heav en shall perform sacrifices', 'one eat poisoned meat,' etc. observed realized self distinct view body self, then, absence observer (injunctions etc.) would follow uselessness scriptures. reply: no, engagement abstention actions follows ordained scriptures. one realized identity lord knower field, one real ized brahman -he engage action. similarly, even person believe self engage action, idea world exist. however, one inferred existence self ground wellknown fact study scriptures dealing injunctions prohibitions becomes otherwise purposeless, knowledge essential nature self, arisen hankering results actions -he faithfully518 enga ges action. matter direct perception us. hence, scriptures purposeless. objection: may scriptures become meaningless when, noticing abstention action case men discriminati on, followers abstain? reply: no, discrimination arises rare person only. for, present, rare one among many people comes possess discrimination. besides, fools follow one discrimination, ( their) engagement action impelled defects attachment etc. seen get engaged acts black magic. moreover, engagement action natural. verily said (by lord), 'but nature acts' (5.14). therefore, mundane state consists nothing ignorance, object perception (to ignorant man sees it) appears him. ignorance effects belong knower feild, absolute. moreover, false knowledge cannot taint supreme reality. for, water mirage cannot taint supreme reality. for, water mirage cannot make desert muddy moisture. similarly, ignorance cannot act way knower field. hence en said, 'and understand519 knower field,' also, 'knowledge remains covered ignorance' (5.15). objection: then, even learned say like worldly people, 'thus [possessed aristorcracy etc.] i,' 'this [body, wi fe, etc.] verily belongs me'? reply: listen. learnedness consists seeing field self! contrary, realize unchanging knower field, crave enjoyment action idea , 'may mine.' enjoyment action mere perversions. so, ignorant man engages action owing desire results. hand, case enlightened person realized changeless self, engagement aciton impossible absence desire results. hence, activities aggregate body organs cease, withdrawal action spoken figurative sense. may kind learnedness: 'the knowe r field god himself; field something different object knowledge knower field. mundane being, happy sorrowful. duty bring cessation worldly existence knowle dge field knower field, continuing dwell true nature520 directly perceiving meditation god, knower field,' who, understands thus, teaches 'he (the taught) knower field,' who, idea, thinks, 'i shall render meaningful scriptures dealing worldly state liberation' -is meanest among learned. self-immolator, devoid link traditional inte rpreters purport scriptures, misinterprets enjoined scriptures imagines spoken there, thereby becoming deluded, befools others too. hence, one knower traditional interpretation ignored like fool, though may versed scriptures. objection that, god one knower field, become mundane being, that, knowers fields one god, nonexistence mundane beings follow absence mundane state, -these two objections refuted admitting knowledge ignorance different characteristics. objection: how? reply: saying defect imagined gnorance affect supreme reality substratum (imagination). accordance521 illustration cited desert made muddy water mirage. even defect possibility nonexistence mu ndange state, consequent nonexistence individual souls, stands refuted explanation mundane state individual souls imagined ignorance. objection: defect mundane existence knower field consis ts possessed ignorance. sorrowfulness etc. products matters direct experience. reply: no, since whatever known attribute field, therefore knower -the knower field - cannot reasonably taint ed defects arising it. whatsoever blemish -not existing knower field -you attribute logically object experience, hence verily quality field; quality knower field. knower field become tainted thereby, knower cannot possibly conjunction object knowledge. conjunction, possibility (the latter's) becoming knowable. oh! sir, b eing ignorant, sorrowful, etc. qualities self, directly perceived? qualities knower field? conclusion522 known consititutes field, one knows verily knower field, then, say ignorant, sorrowful, etc.are qualities knower field directly perceived contradictory statement ignorance basis. here, (the opponent) asks: ignorance belong? (the answer that) belongs verily experienced! objection: perceived? reply: answer is: pointless ask, 'in ignorance experienced?' objection: how? reply: igno rance perceived (by you), perceive possessor well. moreover, possessor ignorance perceived reasonable ask, 'in perceived?' for, owner cattle seen, question, 'to cattle belong', become meaningful. objection: well, illustration dissimilar? since, cattle owner directly perceived, relation also directly perceived. hence question meaningless. ignorance possessor directly perceived manner, case question would meaningless. reply: matter know relation ignorance person directly perceived possessed523 ignorance? opponent: since ignorance source evil, therefore got rid of. reply: ignorance belongs get rid it! opponent: indeed, ignorance belongs myself. reply: case, know ignorance also possess it? opponent: k now, direct perception. reply: know inference, connection (between ignorance) known? surely possible knower time ['when knowing ignorance.'] knowledge relation (of self) ignorance object knowledge; ['after perceived ignorance object knowledge, continue knower cognize knower ignorance? would lead contradiction person becoming subject object cognition.'] cognizer engaged cognizing ignorance object. besides, cannot someone (separate) cognizer relati knower ignorance, separate cognition (relation), would lead infinite regress. knower relation knower thing known cognizable, separate cognizer524 imagined. him, again, another knower imagined; separate cognizer would imagined! thus, infinite regress comes unavoidable. again, whether knowable ignorance anything else, knowable verily knowable; similarly , even knower surely knower; become knowable. so, [since knower cannot known, therefore relation ignorance also cannot known anybody else] nothing cognizer -the knower f ield-is tainted defects ignorance, sorrowfulness, etc. objection: may said (self's) defect surely this, field, full defects, cognized (by it)? reply: no, immutable, conscio usness, nature, figuratively spoken cognizer. like figuratively attributing act heating fire merely (natural) heat. shown lord identification action, cause effect absent self, action, cause, etc. figuratively attributed self owing superimposed (on it) ignorance, shown various places: 'he thinks one killer...'

(from view) also follows possibili ty exhaustion results virtuous deeds yet begun yielding fruits. and, possibility persistence sins incurred past yet commenced yielding results, similarly ther e possibility persistence virtues yet begun bearing fruits. so, scope789 exhausted without creating another body, possibility liberation. since attachment, hatred delusion, causes virtue vice, cannot eradicated means knowledge, therefore eradication virtue vice becomes impossible. besides, since sruti [see ch. .2.23.1 br. 1.5.16 -tr.] mentions nityakarmas heaven result, smrti text, 'persons belonging castes stages life, engaged duties' ['...attain high, immeasurable happiness.' -tr.] (ap. dh. su. 2.2.2.3), etc., therefore exhaustio n (the fruits of) actions (through nityakarmas) possible. say, 'the nityakarmas, painful themselves, must surely result evil deeds done past; apart are, result mentioned vedas enjoined basis mere fact one alive' -(this is) so, actions become operative cannot yield result. besides, ground experiencing par ticular consequence form pain [pain involved performance nityakarmas.] statement, pain one suffers effort involved performing790 nityakarmas result sinful acts done past lives, false. indeed, stand reason result action become operative time death yield fruit experienced life produced actions. otherwise, reason fruit action lead hell experienced life produced actions agnihotra etc. meant enjoying result form heaven! besides, (pain arising effort performing nityakarmas) cannot consequence form particular suffering arising sin. since numerous kinds sins results productive various kinds sorrows, therefore, imagined (sins') result merely form pa arising effort undertaking nityakarmas, certainly possible suppose (the sins incurred past) causes obstacles pairs opposites (heat cold, etc.), disease etc., result sins incurred past pain arising exertion performing nityakarmas, sufferings like carrying stones head etc. further, context say this, pain resulting effo rt791 performing nityakarmas result sinful acts done past. objection: how? vedantin: discussion sin committed past, begun bear fruit, cannot dissipated. context say pain resulting effort undertaking nityakarmas result action begun bearing fruit, yet commenced yielding fruit! hand, think sins committed past begun yielding ir results, unreasonable specify pain resulting exertion performing nitya -karmas result. arises contingency injunction perform nityakarmas becoming void, sinful deed w hich begun bearing fruit ligically dissipated experiencing result. further, pain result nityakarmas enjoined vedas, seen arise effort undertaking nityakarmas -as case excerc ise etc. imagine result something else illogical. [the pain arising bodily excercise result excercise itself, result past sin! similarly, pain resulting undertaking nityakarmas c onsequence performance itself, need imagined792 result past sin.] nityakarmas enjoined simply basis person's alive, unreasonable result sins committed past, expiation is. expiation enjoined following particular sinful act result sin! hand, suffering arising expiation reslut sin cause, pain effort performing nityakarmas, though prescribed merely fact one's alive, may become fruit fact one's alive -which occasion (for enjoining nityakarmas) -, nitya karmas expiatory duties indistinguishable far occasioned something concerned. moreover, fact: distinction pain resulting performance nityakarmas result past sinful deeds, pain performing kamya -karmas (rites duties undertaken desired results), pain performing agnihotra -sacrifice etc. performed nityakarma kamya -karma. thus th e latter also may result past sinful acts. case, untenable assume ground793 circumstantial inference that, since result enjoined vedas nityakarmas since prescription cannot justified ny ground, therefore pain effort performing nityakarmas result sinful past deeds. thus, (vedic) injunction unjustifiable otherwise, inferred nityakarmas got result pain arising f rom effort undertaking them. also involves contradiction: contradictory say performance nityakarma result action experienced. admitted, contradiction say experience result nityakarma, yet niyakarma result! moreover, agnihotra sacrifices performed desirable results (kamya - agnihotra), agnihotra etc. performed nityakarma (nity a-agnihotra) become accomplished simultaneously (on account part ofthe former). hence, since kamya -agnihotra (as act) dependent different nitya - agnihotra, therefore result agnihotra sacrif ices performed desire results get exhausted suffering involved exertion undertaking (the794 nitya -agnihotra). hand, result kamya -agnihotra etc. different, viz heaven etc., even suffer ing arising exertion performing ought necessarily different (from suffering involved nitya -agnihotra). fact, contradicts directly perceived; pain resulting effort performing nitya -(-agnihotra) differ pain resulting exertion undertaking kamya ( -agnihotra). besides, consideration: actions enjoined prohibited (by scriptures) produ ce immediate results. enjoined prohibited scriptures produce immediate results; so, would effort even regard heaven etc. injunctions concerning unseen results. cannot imagine fruit (nitya -) agnihotra etc. gets exhausted suffering arising effort performing them, kamya ( -agnihotra) exalted results like heaven etc. merely consequence fact desire results, tho ugh acts essential difference (the nitya kamya) additional subsidiary part, processes performance, etc. (in795 kamya -agnihotra). therefore, never established nitya -karmas unseen results. hence, enlightenment alone, performance nityakarmas, cuase total dissipation actions done ignorance, good bad. for, actions origin ignorance desire. thus establ ished (in following passages) action (rites duties) meant ignorant, steadfastness knowledge -after renunciation actions -is meant enlightened: 'both know' (2.19); 'he knows one indestru ctible, eternal' (2.21); 'through yoga knowledge men realization; yoga action yogis' (3.3); 'the ignorant, attached work' (3.26); 'but...the one knower...does become attached, thinking thus: "the organs rest objects organs"' (3.28); 'the embodied man...having given actions mentally, continues' (5.13); 'remaining absorbed self, knower reality think, "i certainly anything"' (5.8); i.e; unen lightened person thinks, 'i do'; 'for (the sage) wishes ascend (to dhyana -yoga), action said means...when ascended (when established yoga meditation),796 inaction alone said means' (6.3); 'noble indeed' three (classes of) unenlightened persons, 'but man knowledge self.

[unless one knows self distinct body etc. perform nityakarmas etc. meant results worlds, viz heaven etc. (tr.:) place vyatiriktatmani, ast. reads ' deha -vyatiriktatmani, self distinct body'.] reply: no, since seen regard actions nature motion accomplished -self, one engages idea, 'i do.' [the actionless sel f agent movements body etc. still agentship superimposed ignorance.] objection: said notion egoism regard aggregate body etc. occurs figurative sense; false? reply: no, since effects [i.e. effects notion egoism.] also become figurative. objection: notion 'i' regard aggregate one's body etc. occurs figurative sense. regard one's son said (in veda), 'it called son' (sa. br. 14.9.4.26), common parlance also said, 'this cow life', case here. [as use word 'i' regard son figurative, also regard body.] certainly false notion. however, false notion (of identity) occurs799 case stump man, distinction evident (due darkness). reply: figuratively expressed notion cannot lead effe ct real sense, (notion) used eulogy basis help word comparison remains understood. instance, sentences as, 'devadatta lion', 'the boy fire' -implying 'like lion', 'like fire', basis similarity cruelty, tawny colour, etc. -are meant eulogizing devadatta boy basis (i.e. subjects two sentences). action lion fire accomplished use figurative words ideas. contrary, one experiences evil effects false notions.
