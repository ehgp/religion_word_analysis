srimad bhagavad gita english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda source project gutenberg2 chapter 21 210 o descendant of bharata to him who was sorrowing between the two armies hrsikesa mocking as it were said these words english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 210 and here the text commencing from but seeing the army of the pandavas 12 and ending with he verily became silent telling him govinda i shall not fight is to be explained as revealing the cause of the origin of the defect in the from of sorrow delusion etc delusion means want of discrimination etc stands for the secondary manifestations of sorrow and delusion as also ignorance which is the root cause of all these which are the sources of the cycles of births and deaths of creatu res thus indeed ajunas own sorrow and delusion cuased by the ideas of affection parting etc originating from the erroneous belief i belong to these they belong to me with regard to kingdom see note under verse 8tr elders sons comrades well wishers 126 1 sri sankaracharya begins his commentary of the gi ta only from the 10th verse of 2nd chapter3 kinsmen 137 relatives 134 and friends have been shown by him with the words how can i fightin battle against bhisma 4 etc it is verily because his discriminating insight was overwhelmed by sorrow and delusion tha t even though he had become engaged in battle out of his own accord as a duty of the ksatriyas he desisted from that war and chose to undertake others duties like living on alms etc it is thus that in the case of all creatures whose minds come under th e sway of the defects of sorrow delusion etc there verily follows as a matter of course abandoning their own duties and resorting to prohibited ones even when they engage in their own duties their actions with speech mind body etc are certainly motivated by hankering for rewards and are accompanied by egoism egoism consists in thinking that one is the agent of some work and the enjoyer of its reward such being the case the cycle of births and deaths characterized by passing through desir eable and undesirable births and meeting with happiness sorrow etc from virtuous deeds follow attainment of heaven and happiness from unvirtuous sinful deeds follow births as beasts and other lowly beings and sorrow from the performance of both vi rtuous and sinful deeds follows birth as a human being4 with a mixture of happiness and sorrow from the accumulation of virtue and vice continues unendingly thus sorrow and delusion are therefore the sources of the cycles of births and deaths and the ir cessation comes from nothing other than the knowledge of the self which is preceded by the renunciation of all duties hence wishing to impart that knowledge of the self for favouring the whole world lord vasudeva making arjuna the medium said y ou grieve for those who are not to be grieved for etc as to that some opponents according to ag the opponent is the vrttikara who in the opinion of a mahadeva sastri is none other than bodhayana referred to in sankaracaryas commentary on bs 1111 19tr say certainly liberation cannot be attained merely from continuance in the knowledge of the self which is preceded by renunciation of all duties and is independent of any other factor what then the well ascertained conclusion of the whol e of the gita is that liberation is attained through knowledge associated with rites and duties like agnihotra etc prescribed in the vedas and the smrtis and as an indication of this point of view they quote the verses on the other hand if you will not fight this righteous battle 33 your right is for action5 rites and duties alone 47 therefore you undertake action rites and duties itself 415 etc even this objection should not be raised that vedic rites and duties lead to sin sinc e they involve injury etc objection how opponent the duties of the ksatriyas charaterized by war do not lead to sin when undertaken as ones duty even though they are extremely cruel since they involve violence against elders brothers sons and o thers and from the lords declaration that when they are not performed then forsaking your own duty and fame you will incur sin 33 it stands out as his clearly stated foregone conclusion that ones own duties prescribed in such texts as one s hall perform agnihotra as long as one lives etc and actions which involve crutely to animals etc are not sinful vedantin that is wrong because of the assertion of the distinction between firm adherence nistha to knowledge and to action which are based on two different convictions buddhi the nature of the self the supreme reality determined by the lord in the text beginning with those who are not to be grieved for 11 and running to the end of the verse even considering your own duty 31 is called sankhya sankhya buddhi sankhya is that correct samyak knowledge of the vedas which reveals khyayate the reality of the self the6 supreme goal the reality under discussion which is related to this sankhya by way of having been reveale d by it is sankhya conviction about the reality is the conviction with regard to that supreme reality arising from the ascertainment of the meaning of the context ascertainmentof the context ie of the meaning of the verses starting from ne ver is this one born and never does it die etc 20 that the self is not an agent because of the absence in it of the six kinds of changes viz birth etc birth continuance growth transformation decay and death sankhyas are those men of kno wledge to whom that conviction becomes natural prior to the rise of this conviction sankhya buddhi the ascertained ast and ag omit this word ascertainment nirupana tr of the performance of the disciplines leading to liberation which is ba sed on a discrimination between virtue and vice and adoration of god and which presupposes the selfs difference from the body etc and its agentship and enjoyership is called yoga the conviction with regard to that yoga is yoga buddhi the perfo rmers of rites and duties for whom this conviction is appropriate are called yogis accordingly the two distinct convictions have been pointed out by the lord in the verse this wisdom buddhi has been7 imparted to you from the standpoint of self realization sankhya but listen to this wisdom from the standpoint of karma yoga 39 and of these two the lord will separately speak with reference to the sankhyas of the firm adherence to the yoga of knowledge here yoga and knowledge are ident ical yoga is that through which one gets connected identified with brahman which is based on sankya buddhi in two kinds of adherences were spoken of by me in the form of the vedas in the days of yore this portion is ascending to g1pr and aa ast omits this and quotes exactly the first line of 33 by saying in the form of the vedas the lord indicates that the vedas which are really the knowledge inherent in god and issue out of him are identical with himself tr similarly in thro ugh the yoga of action for the yogis 33 he will separately speak of the firm adherence to the yoga here also karma and yoga are identical and lead to liberation by bringing about purity of heart which is followed by steadfastness in knowledge of k arma which is based on yoga buddhi conviction about yoga thus the two kinds of steadfastness that based on the conviction about the nature of the self and that based on the conviction about rites and duties have been8 distinctly spoken of by the lord himself who saw that the coexistence of knowledge and rites and duties is not possible in the same person they being based on the convictions of non agentship and agentship unity and diversity respectively as is this teaching about the distincti on of the two adherences just so has it been revealed in the satapatha brahmana desiring this world the self alone monks and brahmanas renounce their homes cf br 4422 after thus enjoining renunciation of all rites and duties it is said in continuation what shall we acheive through childeren we who have attained this self this world result the earlier quotation implies an injuction vidhi for renunciation and the second is an arthavada or an emphasis on that injunction arthavada a sentence which usually recommends a vidhi or precept by stating the good arising from its proper observance and the evils arising from its omission and also by adducing historical instances in its support vsa again there itself it is said that before accepting a wife a man is in his natural state the state of ignorance owing to non realization of reality such a person is a brahmacarin who goes to a teacher for studying the vedas and then after his enquiries into rites and duties the br ahmacarin first studies the9 vedas and then enquires into their meaning leaving his teachers house after completing his course he becomes a house holder he for the attainment of the three worlds this world the world of manes and heaven tr desir ed see br 1417 as their means a son and the two kinds of wealth consists of rites and duties that lead to the world of manes and the divine wealth of acquisition of vidya meditation which leads to heaven in this way it is shown that rites and dut ies enjoined by the vedas etc are meant only for one who is unenlightened and is possessed of desire and in the text after renouncing they take to mendicancy see br 4422 the injunction to renounce is only for one who desires the world that is th e self and who is devoid of hankering for anything else now if the intention of the lord were the combination of knowledge with vedic rites and duties then this utterance of the lord 33 about the distinction would have been illogical nor would arjunas question if it be your opinion that wisdom knowledge is superior to action rites and duties etc 31 be proper if the lord had not spoken earlier of the impossibility of the pursuit of knowledge and rites and duties by the same perso n at the same time then how could arjuna falsely impute to the lord by10 saying if it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action of having spoken what was not heard by him viz the higher status of knowledge over rites and duties moreover if it be that the combination of knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of for all then it stands enjoined ipso facto on arjuna as well therefore if instruction had been given for practising both then how could the question about either of the two arise as in tell me for certain one of these action and renunciation by which i may attain the highest good 32 indeed when a physician tells a patient who has come for a cure of his biliousness that he should take things which are swe et and soothing there can arise no such request as tell me which one of these two is to be taken as a means to cure biliousness again if it be imagined that arjuna put the question because of his non comprehension of the distinct meaning of what the lord had said even then the lord ought to have answered in accordance with the question the combination of knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of by me why are you confused thus on the other ha nd it was not proper to have answered two kinds of steadfastness were spoken of by me it the days of yore in a way that was inconsistent and at variance with the question11 nor even do all the statements about distinction etc become logical if it were intended that knowledge was to be combined with rites and duties enjoined by the smrtis only besides the accusation in the sentence why then do you urge me to horrible action 31 becomes illogical on the part of arjuna who knew that fighting was a ksatriyas natural duty enjoined by the smrtis therefore it is not possible for anyone to show that in the scripture called the gita there is any combination even in the least of knowledge of the self with rites and duties enjoined by the srutis or the smrtis but in the case of a man who had engaged himself in rites and duties because of ignorance and defects like the attachment and then got his mind purified through sacrifices charities or austerities see br 4422 there arises the knowledge abo ut the supreme reality that all this is but one and brahman is not an agent of any action with regard to him although there is a cessation of rites and duties as also of the need for them yet what may appear as his diligent continuance just as before in those rites and duties for setting an example before people that is no action in which case it could have stood combined with knowledge just as the actions of lord vasudeva in the form of performance of the duty12 of a ksatriya do not get co mbined with knowledge for the sake of achieving the human goal liberation similar is the case with the man of knowledge because of the absence of hankering for results and agentship indeed a man who has realized the truth does not thingk i am doing this nor does he hanker after its result again as for instance person hankering after such desirable things as heaven etc may light up a fire for performing such rites as agnihotra etc which are the mans to attain desirable things the ast reading is agnihotradi karma laksana dharma anusthanaya for the performance of duties in the form of acts like agnihotra etc tr then while he is still engaged in the performance of agnihotra etc as the means for the desirable things the desire may get des troyed when the rite is half done he may nevertheless continue the performance of those very agnihotra etc but those performance of those very agnihotra etc but those agnihotra etc cannot be held to be for this personal gain accordingly does the lor d also show in various places that even while perfroming actions he does not act he does not become tainted 57 as for the texts as was performed earlier by the ancient ones 415 for janaka and others strove to attain liberation through action itself 32013 they are to be understood analytically objection how so vedantin as to that if janaka and others of old remained engaged in activity even though they were knowers of reality they did so for preventing people from going astray while remaining established in realization verily through the knowledge that the organs rest act on the objects of the organs 328 the idea is this that though the occasion for renunciation of activity did arise they remained established in reali zation along with actions they did not give up their rites and duties on the other hand if they were not knowers of reality then the explanation should be this through the discipline of dedicating rites and duties to god janaka and others remained established in perfection samsiddhi either in the form of purification of mind or rise of knowledge this very idea the idea that rites and duties become the cause of knowledge through the purification of the mind will be expressed by the lord in the yogis undertake action for the purification of oneself ie of the heart or the mind 511 after having said a human being achieves success by adoring him through his own duties by performing ones own duty as enjoined by scriptures and dedicat ing their results to god ones mind becomes purified then through gods14 grace one becomes fit for steadfastness in knowledge from that steadfatness follows liberation therefore rites and duites do not directly lead to liberation see common under 512 1846 he will again speak of the steadfastness in knowledge of a person who has attained success in the text understandfrom methat process by which one who has achieved success attains brahman 1850 so the definite conclusion in the g ita is that liberation is attained only from the knowledge of reality and not from its combination with action and by pointing out in the relevant contexts the aforesaid distinction we shall show how this conclusion stands that being so lord vasudev a found that for arjuna whose mind was thus confused about what ought to be done the ast and aa have an additional word mithyajnanavatah meaning who had false ignorance tr and who was sunk in a great ocean of sorrow there could be no rescue other than through the knowledge of the self and desiring to rescue arjuna from that he said you grieve for those who are not to be grieved for etc by way of introducing the knowledge of the self in this gita there are three distinct parts eac h part consisting of six chapters these three parts deal with the three words of the great upanisadic saying15 tattvamasi thou art that with a view to finding out their real meanings the first six chapters are concerned with the word tvam thou the following six chapters determine the meaning of the word tat that and the last six reveal the essential identity of tvam and tat the disciplines necessary for realization this identity are stated in the relevant places 211 the blessed lord said you grieve for whose who are not to be grieved for and you speak words of wisdom the learned do not grieve for the departed and those who have not departed english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 211 bhisma drona and others are not to be grieved for because they are of noble character and are eternal in their real nature with regard to them asocyan who are not to be grieved for tvam you anvasocah grieve thinking they die because of me wit hout them what shall i do with dominion and enjoyment ca and bhasase you speak prajnavadan words of wisdom words used by men of wisdom of intelligence the idea is16 like one mad you show in yourself this foolishness and learning which are contr adictory because panditah the learned the knowers of the self panda means wisdon about the self those indeed who have this are panditah one the authority of the upanisadic text the knowers of brahman having known all about scholarship br 351 therefore the knowers of brahman having known all about scholorship should try to live upon that strength which comes of knowledge having known all about this strength as well as scholorship he becomes meditative having known all about b oth meditativeness and its opposite he becomes a knower of brahman na anusocanti do not grieve for gatasun the departed whose life has become extinct agatasun ca and for those who have not departed whose life has not left the living the i deas is your are sorrowing for those who are eternal in the real sense and who are not to be grieved for hence your are a fool 212 but certainly it is not a fact that i did not exist at any time nor you nor these rulers of men and surely it is not that we all shall cease to exist after this17 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 212 why are they not to be grieved for because they are eternal how na tu eva but certainly it is not a f act that jatu at any time aham i na asam did not exist on the contrary i did exist the idea is that when the bodies were born or died in the past i existed eternally here ast adds ghatadisu viyadiva like space in pot etc tr similarly na tvam nor is it that you did not exist but you surely existed ca and so also na ime nor is it that these janaadhipah rulers of men did not exist on the other hand they did exist and similarly na eva it is surely not that vayam we sarve all na bhavisyamah shall cease to exist atah param after this even after the destruction of this body on the contrary we shall exist the meaning is that even in all the three times past present and future we are eternal in our nature as the self the plural number in we is used following the diversity of the bodies but not in the sense of the multiplicity of the self 213 as are boyhood youth and decrepitude to an embodied being in this present body similar is18 the acquisition of anothe r body this being so an intelligent person does not get deluded english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 213 as to that to show how the self is eternal the lord cites an illustration by sayingof th e embodied etc yatha as are the manner in which kaumaram boyhood yauvanam youth middle age and jara decrepitude advance of age dehinah to an embodied being to one who possesses a body deha to the self possessing a body asmin in this p resent dehe body these three states are mutually distinct on these when the first state gets destroyed the self does not get destroyed when the second state comes into being it is not born what then it is seen that the self which verily remains unchanged acquires the second and third states tatha similar indeed is its the unchanging selfs dehantarapraptih acquisition of another body a body different from the present one this is the meaning tatra this being so dhirah an intelligent person na does not muhyati get deluded19 214 but the contacts of the organs with the objects are the producers of cold and heat happiness and sorrow they have a beginning and an end and are transient bear them o descendant of bharata engl ish translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 214 in the case of a man who knows that the self is eternal although there is no possibility of delusion concerning the destruction of the self still delusion as of ord inary people caused by the experience of cold heat happiness and sorrow is noticed in him delusion arises from being deprived of happiness and sorrow arises from contact with pain etc apprehending this kind of a talk from arjuna the lord said but the contacts of the organs etc matra sparsah the contacts of the organs with objects are sita usna sukha duhkha dah producers of cold heat happiness and sorrow matrah means those by which are marked off measured up sounds etc ie the organs of hearing etc the sparsah contacts of the organs with sound etc are matra sparsah or sparsah means those which are contacted ie objects viz sound etc matra sparsah the organs and objects are the producers of cold heat happiness and20 sorrow cold sometimes produces pleasure and sometimes pain similarly the nature of heat too is unpredictable on the other hand happiness and sorrow have definite natures since they do not change hence they are mentioned separately from cold and heat since they the organs the contacts etc agamapayinah have a beginning and an end are by nature subject to origination and destruction therefore they are anityah transient hence titiksasva bear tan them cold heart etc ie do not be happy or sorry with regard to them 215 o arjuna who are foremost among men verily the person whom these do not torment the wise man to whom sorrow and happhiness are the same he is fit for immortality english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 215 what will happen to one who bears cold and heat listen verily the personetc o arjuna hi verily yam purusam the person whom ete these cold and heat mentioned above na do not vyathayanti torment do not perturb dhiram the wise man sama duhkha sukham to whom sorrow and happiness are the same who is free from21 happiness and sorrow when subjected to pleasure and pain because of his realization of the enternal self sah he who is established in the realization of the enternal self who forbears the opposites kalpate becomes fit amrtattvaya for immortality for the state of immortality ie for liberation 216 of the unreal there is no b eing the real has no nonexistence but the nature of both these indeed has been realized by the seers of truth english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 216 since the unreal has no being etc for this reason also it is proper to bear cold heat etc without becoming sorrowful or deluded asatah of the unreal of cold heat etc together with their causes na vidyate there is no bhavah being existence reality because heat cold etc together with their causes are not substantially real when tested by means of proof for they are changeful and whatever is changeful is inconstant as configurations like pot etc are unreal since they are not perceived to be different from earth when tested by th e eyes so also are all changeful things unreal because they are not perceived to be22 different from their material causes and also because they are not perceived before their origination and after destruction objection if it be that here ast has t he additional words karyasya ghatadeh the effect viz pot etc and tr such material causes as earth etc as also their causes are unreal since they are not perceived differently from their causes in that case may it not be urged that owing to t he nonexistence of those causes there will arise the contingency of everything becoming unreal an entity cannot be said to be unreal merely because it is non different from its cause were it to be asserted as being unreal then the cause also should be unreal because there is no entity which is not subject to the law of cuase and effect vedantin no for in all cases there is the experience of two awarenesses viz the awareness of reality and the awareness of unreality in all cases of perception two awarenesses are involved one is invariable and the other is variable since the variable is imagined on the invariable therefore it is proved that there is something which is the substratum of all imagination and which is neither a cause nor an eff ect that in relation to which the awareness does not change is real that in relation to which it changes is unreal thus since the distinction between the real and the23 unreal is dependent on awareness therefore in all cases of empirical experiences everyone has two kinds of awarenesses with regard to the same substratum as for instance the experiences the pot is real the cloth is real the elephant is real which experiences are not like that of a blue lotus in the empirical expe rience a blue lotus there are two awarenesses concerned with two entities viz the substance lotus and the quality blueness in the case of the experience the pot is real etc the awarenesses are not concerned with substratum and qualities but the awareness of potof cloth etc are superimposed on the awareness of reality like that of water in a mirage this is how it happens everywhere the coexistence of reality and pot etc are valid only empirically according to the non duali sts whereas the coexistence of blueness and lotus is real according to the dualists of these two awareness the awareness of pot etc is inconstant and thus has it been shown above but the awareness of reality is not inconstant therefore the ob ject of the awareness of pot etc is unreal because of inconstancy but not so the object of the awareness of reality because of its constancy objection if it be argued that since the awareness of pot also changes when the pot is destroyed24 therefore t he awareness of the pots reality is also changeful vedantin no because in cloth etc the awareness of reality is seen to persist that awareness relates to the odjective and not to the noun pot for this reason also it is not destroyed this last sentence has been cited in the fn of aa tr objection if it be argued that like the awareness of reality the awareness of a pot also persists in other pots vedantin no because that awareness of pot is not present in the awareness of a cloth e tc objection may it not be that even the awareness of reality is not present in relation to a pot that has been destroyed vedantin no because the noun is absent there since the awareness of reality corresponds to the adjective ie it is used adje ctivelly therefore when the noun is missing there is no possibility of its that awareness being an adjective so to what should it relate but again the awareness of reality does not cease with the absence of an object even when a pot is absen t and the awareness of reality does not arise with regard to it the awareness of reality persists in the region where the pot had existed some read nanu in place of na tu but again in that case the first portion nosinceadjective sorel ate is a statement of the vedantin and the objection starts from nanu25 punah sadbuddheh etc so the next objection will run thus may it not be said that when nouns like pot etc are absent the awareness of existence has no noun to qualify and ther efore it becomes impossible for it the awareness of existence to exist in the same substratum tr objection may it not be said that when nouns like pot etc are absent the awareness of existence has no noun to qualify and therefore it becomes imp ossible for it to exist in the same substratum the relationship of an adjective and a noun is seen between two real entities therefore if the relationship between pot and reality be the same as between a noun and an adjective then both of them wil l be real entities so the coexistence of reality with a non pot does not stand to reason vedantin no because in such experiences as this water exists which arises on seeing a mirage etc it is observed that there is a coexistence of two objects though one of them is nonexistent therefore asatah of the unreal viz body etc and the dualities heat cold etc together with their causes na vidyate there is no bhavah being and similarly satah of the real of the self na vidyate there is no abhavah nonexistence because it is constant everywhere this is what we have said tu but antah the nature the conclusion regarding the nature of the26 real and the unreal that the real is verily real and the unreal is verily unreal ubhayoh api of both these indeed of the self and the non self of the real and the unreal as explained above drstah has been realized thus tattva darsibhih by the seers of truth tat is a pronoun sarvanama lit name of all which can be used with regard to all and all is brahman and its name is tat the abstraction of tat is tattva the true nature of brahman those who are apt to realize this are tattva darsinah seers of truth therefore you too by adopting the vision of the men of realization and g iving up sorrow and delusion forbear the dualities heat cold etc some of which are definite in their nature and others inconstant mentally being convinced that this phenomenal world is changeful verily unreal and appears falsely like water in a mirage this is the idea what again is that reality which remains verily as the real and surely for ever this is being answered in but know that etc 217 but know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded none can bring abo ut the destruction of this immutable27 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 217 tu but this word is used for distinguishing reality from unreality tat viddhi know that to be avinasi indestructib le by nature not subject to destruction what that yena by which by which brahman called reality sarvam all idam this the universe together with space is tatam pervaded as pot etc are pervaded by space na kascit none arhati can kartum bring about vinasam the destruction disappearance nonexistence asya of this avyayasya of the immutable that which does not undergo growth and depletion by its very nature this brahman called reality does not suffer mutation because unlike bodies etc it has no limbs nor does it suffer mutation by loss of something belonging to it because it has nothing that is its own brahman surely does not suffer loss like devadatta suffering from loss of wealth therefore no one can bring about the des truction of this immutable brahman no one not even god himself can destroy his own self because the self is brahman besides action with regard to ones self is self contradictory which again is that unreal that is said to change its own nature this is being answered28 218 these destructible bodies are said to belong to the everlasting indestructible indeterminable embodied one therefore o descendant of bharata join the battle english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit comme ntary swami gambhirananda 218 ime these antavantah destructible dehah bodies as the idea of reality which continues with regard to water in a mirage etc gets eliminated when examined with the means of knowledge and that is its end so are t hese bodies and they have an end like bodies etc in dream and magic uktah are said by discriminating people to belong nityasya to the everlasting anasinah the indestructible aprameyasya the indeterminable sarirnah embodied one the self thi s is the meaning the two words everlasting and indestructible are not repetitive because in common usage everlastingness and destructibility are of two kinds as for instance a body which is reduced to ashes and has disappeared is said to have been destoryed and even while existing when it becomes transfigured by being afflicted with diseases etc it is said to be destroyed here29 the aa adds tatha dhana nase apyevam similar is the case even with regard to loss of wealth tr that being s o by the two words everlasting and indestructible it is meant that it is not subject to both kinds of distruction otherwise the everlastingness of the self would be like that of the earth etc therefore in order that this contingency may not arise it is said of the everlasting indestructible aprameyasya of the indeterminable means of that which cannot be determined by such means of knowledge as direct perception etc objection is it not that the self is determined by the scriptures and b efore that through direct perception etc vedantin no because the self is self evident for only when the self stands predetermined as the knower there is a search for a means of knolwedge by the knower indeed it is not that without first determin ing oneself as i am such one takes up the task of determining an object of knowledge for what is called the self does not remain unknown to anyone but the scripture is the final authority when the vedic text establishes brahman as the innermost se lf all the distinctions such as knower known and the means of knowledge become sublated thus it is reasonable that the vedic text should be the final authority besides its authority30 is derived from its being faultless in as much as it has not originat ed from any human being by way of merely negating superimposition of qualities that do not belong to the self it attains authoritativeness with regard to the self but not by virtue of making some unknown thing known there is an upanisadic text in sup port of this the brahman that is immediate and direct the self that is within all br 341 since the self is thus eternal and unchanging tasmat therefore yudhyasva you join the battle ie do not desist from the war here there is no injunc tion to take up war as a duty because be arjuna though he was determined for war remains silent as a result of being overpowered by sorrow and delusion therefore all that is being done by the lord is the removal of the obstruction to his duty ther efore join the battle is only an approval not an injunction the scripture gita is intended for eradicating sorrow delusion etc which are the cases of the cycle of births and deaths it is not intended to enjoin action as evidences of this idea the lord cites two vedic verses ka 1219 20 there are slight verbal differences tr31 219 he who thinks of this one as the killer and he who thinks of this one as the killed both of them do not know this one does not kill nor is it killed english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 219 but the ideas that you have bhisma and others are neing killed by me in war i am surely their killer this idea of yours is false how yah he who vetti thinks of enam this one the embodied one under consideration as hantaram the killer the agent of the act of killing ca and yah he who the other who manyate thinks of enam this one as hatam the killed who thinks when the body is killed i am myself killed i become the object of the act of killing ubhau tau both of the m owing to non discrimination na do not vijanitah know the self which is the subject of the consciousness of i the meaning is on the killing of the body he who thinks of the self the content of the consciousness of i the ast omits thi s phrase from the precedig sentence and includes it in this place the aa has this phrase in both the places tr as i am the killer and he who thinks i have been killed both of them are32 ignorant of the nature of the self for ayam this self o wing to its changelessness na hanti does not kill does not become the agent of the act of killing na hanyate nor is it killed ie it does not become the object of the act of killing the second verse is to show how the self is changeless 220 never is this one born and never does it die nor is it that having come to exist it will again cease to be this one is birthless eternal undecaying ancient it is not killed when the body is killed english translation of sri sankaracharyas sa nskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 220 na kadacit neverl is ayam this one jayate born ie the self has no change in the form of being born to which matter is subject va and va is used in the sense of and na mriyate it never die s by this is denied the final change in the form of destruction the word na kadacit never is connected with the denial of all kinds of changes thus never is it born never does it die and so on since ayam this self bhutva having come to exis t33 having experienced the process of origination na will not bhuyah again abhavita cease to be thereafter therefore it does not die for in common parlance that which ceases to exist after coming into being is said to die from the use of the word va nor and na it is understood that unlike the body this self does not again come into existence after having been non existent therefore it is not born for the words it is born are used with regard to something which comes into existence afte r having been non existent the self is not like this therfore it is not born since this is so therefore it is ajah birthless and since it does not die therefore it is nityah eternal although all changes become negated by the denial of the first and the last kinds of changes still changes occuring in the middle for the six kinds of changes see note under verse 210 tr should be denied with their own respective terms by which they are implied therefore the text says sasvatah undecaying so th at all the changes viz youth etc which have not been mentioned may become negated the change in the form of decay is denied by the word sasvata that which lasts for ever in its own nature it does not decay because it is free from parts and again si nce it is without qualities there is no degeneration owing to the decay of any34 quality change in the form of growth which is opposed to decay is also denied by the word puranah ancient a thing that grows by the addition of some parts is said to incre ase and is also said to be new but this self was fresh even in the past due to its partlessness thus it is puranah ie it does not grow so also na hanyate it is puranah ie it does not grow so also na hanyate it is not killed it does not get t ransformed even when sarire the body hanyamane is killed transformed the verb to kill has to be understood here in the sense of transformation so that a tautology this verse has already mentioned death in the first line if the verb han to kil l is also taken in the sense of killing then a tautology is unavoidable tr may be avoided in this mantra the six kinds of transformations the material changes seen in the world are denied in the self the meaning of the sentence is that the self is devoid of all kinds of changes since this is so therefore both of them do not know this is how the present mantra is connected to the earlier mantra 221 o partha he who knows this one as indestructible eternal birthless and undecaying how and whom does that person kill or whom35 does he cause to be killed this is not a question but only an emphatic denial tr english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 221 in the mantra he who thinks of t his one as the killer having declared that the self does not become the agent or the object of the actof killing and then in the mantra never is this one born etc having stated the reasons for its changelessness the lord sums up the purport o f what was declared above he who knows this one as indestructible etc yah he who veda knows yah is to be thus connected with veda enam this one possessing the characteristics stated in the earlier mantra as avinasinam indestructible devoi d of the final change of state nityam eternal devoid of transformation ajam birthless and avyayam undecaying katham how in what way and kam whom does sah that man of realization purusah the person who is himself an authority ie above a ll injunctions and prohibitions see 181617 tr hanti kill undertake the act of killing or how ghatayati does he cause others to be killed how does he36 instigate a killer the intention is to deny both the acts by saying in no way does he kill any one nor does he cause anyone to be killed because an interrogative sense is absurd here since the implication of the reason the reason for the denial of killing etc is the changelessness of the self and this reason holds good with regard to all actions of the man of realization tr viz the immutability of the self the aa omits viz the immutability of the self tr is common with regard to all actions therefore the negation of all kinds of actions in the case of a man of realiz ation is what the lord conveys as the only purport of this context but the denial of the act of killing has been cited by way of an example objection by noticing what special reason for the impossibility of actions in the case of the man of realizatio n does the lord deny all actions in his case by saying how can that person etc vedantin has not the immutability of the self been already stated as the reason some readings omit this word tr the specific ground for the impossibility of all a ctions objection it is true that it has been stated but that is not a specific ground for the man of realization is different from the immutable self indeed may it not be argued that action does not become impossible for one who has known as unchangi ng37 stump of a tree vedantin no because of man of knowledge is one with the self enlightenment does not belong to the aggregate of body and senses therefore as the last laternative the knower is the immutable and is the self which is not a part of t he aggregate thus action being impossible for that man of knowledge the denial in how can that person etc is reasonable as on account of the lack of knowledge of the distinction between the self and the modifications of the intellect the self though verily immutable is imagined through ignorance to be the perceiver of objects like sound etc presented by the intellect etc in this very way the self which in reality is immutable is said to be the knower because of its association with th e knowledge of the distinction between the self and non self which knowledge is a modification of the intellect by buddhi vrtti modification of the intellect is meant the transformation of the internal organ into the form of an extension upto an obje ct along with its past impressions the senses concerned etc like the extension of the light of a lamp illuminating an object consciousness reflected on this transformation and remaining indistinguishable from that transformation revealing the object is called objective knowledge thereby due to38 ignorance the self is imagined to be the perceiver because of its connection with the vrtti modification ag the process is elsewhere described as follows the vrtti goes out through the sense organ co ncerned like the flash of a torchlight and along with it goes the reflection of consciousness both of them envelop the object a pot for instance the vrtti destroys the ignorance about the pot and the reflection of consciousness becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot reveals the pot in the case of knowledge of brahman it is admitted that the vrtti in the form i am brahman does reach brahman and destroys ignorance about brahman but it is not admitted t hat brahman is revealed like a pot for brahman is self effulgent tr and is unreal by nature from the statement that action is impossible for man of realization it is understood that the conclusion of the lord is that actions enjoined by the scriptu res are prescribed for the unenlightened objection is not elightenment too enjoined for the ignorant for the injunction about enlightenment to one who has already achieved realization is useless like grinding something that has already been ground this being so the distinction that rites and duties are enjoined for the unenlightened and not for the39 enlightened one does not stand to reason vedantin no there can reasonable be a distinction between the existence or nonexistence of a thing to be per formed as after the knowledge of the meaning of the injunction for rites like agnihotra etc their performance becomes bligatory on the unenlightened one who thinks agnihotra etc has to be performed by collecting various accessories i am the agent an d this is my duty unlike this nothing remains later on to be performed as a duty after knowing the meaning of the injunction about the nature of the self from such texts as never is this one born etc but apart from the rise of knowledge regardin g the unity of the self his non agency etc in the form i am not the agent i am not the enjoyer etc no other idea arises thus this distinction can be maintained again for anyone who knows himself as i am the agent there will necessarily a rise the idea this is my duty in relation to that he becomes eligible in this way duties are enjoined ast adds sambhavanti become possible tr for him and according to the text both of them do not know 19 he is an unenlightened man an d the text how can that person etc concerns the enlightened person distinguished above becuase of the negation of action in this text therefore40 the enlightened person distinguished above who has realized the immutable self and the seeker of liberation are qualified only for renunciation of all rites and duties therefore indeed the lord narayana making a distinction between the enlightened man of knowledge and the unenlightened man of rites and duties makes them take up the two kinds of adhe rences in the text through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization through the yoga of action for the yogis 33 similarly also vyasa said to his son now there are these two paths etc now there are these two paths on which the veda s are based they are thought of as the dharma characterized by engagement in duties and that by renunciation of them mbh sa 2416 tr so also there is a vedic text meaning the path of rites and duties indeed is the earlier and renunciation comes after that ast says that this is not a quotation but only gives the purport of tai ar 106212 tr the lord will show again and again this very division the unenlightened man who is deluded by egoism thinks thus i am the doer but the o ne who is a knower of the facts about the varieties of the gunas thinks i do not act cf 32728 so also there is the text the embodied man of selfcontrol having given up all actions mentally41 continues happily in the town of nine gates 5 13 etc with regard to this some wiseacres say in no person does arise the idea i am the changeless actionless self which is one and devoid of the six kinds of changes beginning with birth to which all things are subject on the occurrence of which idea alone can renunciation of all actions be enjoined that is not correct because it will lead to the needlessness of such scriptural instructions as never is this one born etc 20 they should be asked as on the authority of scripural instruc tions there arises the knowledge of the existence of virtue and vice and the knowledge regarding an agent who gets associated with successive bodies similarly why should not there arise from the scriptures the knowledge of unchangeability non agentship oneness etc of that very self objection if it be said that this is due to its being beyond the scope of any means of knowledge vedantin no because the sruti says it is to be realized through the mind alone following the instruction of the teacher br 4419 the mind that is purified by the instructions of the scriptures and the teacher control of the body and organs etc becomes the instrument for realizing the self again since there exist inference and scriptures for its realization it is mere bravado to say that knowledge does not42 arise and it has to be granted that when knowledge arises it surely eliminates ignorance its opposite and that ignorance has been shown in i am the killer i am killed and both of them do not kn ow see 219 and here also it is shown that the idea of the self being an agent the object of an action or an indirect agent is the result of ignorance also the self being changeless the fact that such agentship etc are cuased by ignorance is a common factor in all actions without exception because only that agent who is subject to change instigates someone else who is different from himself and can be acted on saying do this thus with a view to pointing out the absence of fitness for rites and duties in the case of an enlightened person the lord ast adds vasudeva after lord tr says he who knows this one as indestructible how can that person etc thereby denying this direct and indirect agentship of an enlightened person in respect of all actions without exception as regards the question for what again is the man of enlightenment qualified the answer has already been give earlier in through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization 33 similarly the lor d will also speak of renunication of all actions in having given up all actions mentally etc513 objection may it not43 be argued that from the expression mentally it follows that oral and bodily actions are not to be renounced vedantin no because of the categoric expression all actions objection may it not be argued that all actions relates only to those of the mind vedantin no because all oral and bodily actions are preceded by those of the mind for those actions are impossible in the absence of mental activity objection may it not be said that one has to mentally renounce all other activities except the mental functions which are the causes of scriptural rites and duties performed through speech and body vedantin no because it has been specifically expressed without doing or causing others to do anything at all 513 objection may it not be that this renunciation of all actions as stated by the lord is with regard to a dying man not one living vedantin no becau se in that case the specific statement the embodied mancontinues happily in the town of nine gates ibid will become illogical since it is not possible for a dead person who neither acts nor makes others act the words akurvatah akarayatah o f him who neither acts nor makes others act have been taken as a part of the commentators arguement but ag points out that they can also form a part of the next objection in that case the44 translation of the objection will be this can it not be t hat the construction of the sentence under discussion is neither doing nor making others do he rest by depositing sannyasya by renouncing in the body but not he rests in the body by renouncing to rest in that body after renouncing all act ions objection can it not be that the construction of the sentence under discussion is he rests by depositing sannyasya by renouncing in the body but not he rests in the body by renouncing vedantin no because everywhere it is categor ically asserted that the self is changeless besides the action of resting requires a location whereas renunciation is independent of this the word nyasa preceded by sam here means renunciation not depositing therefore according to this scriptu re viz the gita the man of realization is eligible for renunciation alone not for rites and duties this we shall show in the relevant texts later on in the cotext of the knowledge of the self and now we shall speak of the matter on hand as to that the indestructibility indestructibility suggests unchangeability as well of the self has been postulated what is it like that is being said in as after rejecting wornout clothes etc45 222 as after rejecting wornout clothes a man takes up othe r new ones likewise after rejecting wornout bodies the embodied one unites with other new ones english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 222 yatha as in the world vihaya after rejecting jirnani wornout vasamsi clothes narah a man grhnati takes up aparani other navani new ones tatha likewise in that very manner vihaya after rejecting jirnani wornout sarirani bodies dehi the embodied one the self which is surely unchanging like the man in the example samyati unites with anyani other navani new ones this is meaning 223 weapons do not cut it fire does not burn it water does not moisten it and air does not dry it english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit comme ntary swami gambhirananda 223 why does it verily remain unchanged this is being answered in weapons do not cut it etc sastrani weapons na do not chindanti cut enam it the embodied one under discussion it being46 partless weapons like swo rd etc do not cut off its limbs so also even pavakah fire na dahati enam does not burn does not reduce it to ashes ca and similarly apah water na enam kledayanti does not moisten it for water has the power of disintegrating a substance that h as parts by the process of moistening it that is not possible in the case of the partless self similarly air destroys an oil substance by drying up the oil even marutah air na sosayati does not dry enam it ones own self ast reads enam tu atmanam but this self in place of enam svatmanam tr 224 it cannot be cut it cannot be burnt cannot be moistened and surely cannot be dried up it is eternal omnipresent stationary unmoving and changeless english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 224 since this is so therefore ayam it acchedyah cannot be cut since the other elements which are the causes of destruction of one ano ther are not capable of dest roying this self therefore it is nityah eternal being eternal it is sarva gatah omnipresent being omnipresent it is sthanuh47 stationary ie fixed like a stump being fixed ayam this self is acalah unmoving therefore it is sanatanah changeles s ie it is not produced from any cause as a new thing it is not to be argued that these verses are repetive since eternality and changelessness of the self have been stated in a single verse itself never is this one born and never does it die et c 20 whatever has been said there in verse 19 about the self does not go beyond the meaning of this verse something is repeated with those very words and something ideologically since the object viz the self is inscrutable therefore lord vasud eva raises the topic again and again and explains that very object in other words so that somehow the unmanifest self may come within the comprehension of the intellect of the transmigrating persons and bring about a cessation of their cycles of births and deaths 225 it is said that this is unmanifest this is inconceivable this is unchangeable therefore having known this thus you ougth not to grieve english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda48 225 moreover ucyate it is said that ayam this the self is avyaktah unmanifest since being beyond the ken of all the organs it cannot be objectified for this very reason ayam this is acintyah inconceivable for anything that comes within the purv iew of the organs becomes the object of thought but this self is inconceivable becuase it is not an object of the organs hence indeed it is avikaryah unchangeable this self does not change as milk does when mixed with curd a curdling medium etc an d it is chnageless owing to partlessness for it is not seen that any noncomposite thing is changeful not being subject to transformation it is said to be changeless tasmat therefore vidivata having known enam this one the self evam thus as described na arhasi you ought not anusocitum to grieve thinking i am the slayer of these these are killed by me 226 on the other hand if you think this one is born continually or dies constantly even then o mighty armed one you ought not t o grieve thus english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda49 226 this verse on the other hand etc is uttered assuming that the self is transient atha ca on the other hand if conveys the sense of assumption following ordinary experience manyase you think enam this one the self under discussion is nityajatam born continually becomes born with the birth of each of the numerous bodies va or nityam constantly mrtam dies along with the death of each of these bodies tatha api even then even if the self be of that nature tvam you maha baho o mighty armed one na arhasi ought not socitum to grieve evam thus since that which is subject to birth will die and that which is sub ject to death will be born these two are inevitable 227 for death of anyone born is certain and of the dead re birth is a certainly therefore you ought not to grieve over an inevitable fact english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 227 this being so death of anyone born etc hi for mrtyuh death jatasya of anyone born dhruvah is certain is without exception ca and mrtasya of the dead janmah re birth is50 dhruvam a certainly tas mat therefore this fact viz birth and death is inevitable with regard to that fact apariharye over an enevitable arthe fact tvam you na arhasi ought not socitum to grieve 228 o descendant of bharata all beings remain unmanifest in t he beginning they become manifest in the middle after death they certainly become unmanifest what lamentation can there be with regard to them english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 228 it is not reasonable to grieve even for beings which are constituted by bodies and organs since all beings remain unmanifest etc bharata o descendant of bharata bhutani all beings avyaktaduni remain unmainfest in the beginning those beings viz sons friends and others constituted by bodies and organs another reading is karya karana sanghata aggregates formed by material elements acting as causes and effects tr who before their origination have unmanifestedness avyakta invisibili ty51 nonperception as their beginning adi are avyaktaadini ca and after origination before death they become vyakta madhyani manifest in the middle again they eva certainly become avyakta nidhanani unmanifest after death those which have unma nifestness avyakta invisibility as their death nidhana are avyakta nidhanani the idea is that even after death they verily attain unmanifestedness accordingly has it been said they emerged from invisibility and have gone back to invisibility th ey are not yours nor are you theirs what is this fruitless lamentation mbh st 213 ka what paridevana lamentation or what prattle can there be tatra with regard to them ie with regard to beings which are objects of delusion which are in visible become visible and then get destroyed 229 someone visualizes it as a wonder and similarly indeed someone else talks of it as a wonder and someone else hears of it as a wonder and some one else indeed does not realize it even after hearing about it english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda52 229 this self under discussion is inscrutable why should i blame you alone regarding a thing that is a source of delusion to all how is this se lf inscrutable it may be argued that the self is the object of egoism the answer is although the individualized self is the object of egoism the absolute self is not this is being answered in someone visualizes it as a wonder etc kascit someon e pasyati visualizes enam it the self ascaryavat as a wonder as though it were a wonder a wonder is something not seen before something strange something seen all on a sudden what is comparable to that is ascarya vat ca and tatha similarl y eva indeed kascit someone anyah else vadati talks of it as a wonder and someone else srnoti hears of it as a wonder and someone indeed na does not veda realize it api even srutva after hearing seeing and speaking about it or the m eaning is he who sees the self is like a wonder he who speaks of it and the who hears of it is indeed rare among many thousands therefore the idea is that the self is difficult to understand now in the course of concluding the topic under discussion viz the needlessness of sorrow and delusionfrom the point of view of the nature of things he says o descendant of bharata this embodied self etc53 230 o descendant of bharata this embodied self existing in everyones body can never be killed therefore you ought not to grieve for all these beings english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 230 because of being partless and eternal ayam this dehi embodied self nityam avadhyah can never be killed under any condition that being so although existing sarvasya dehe in all bodies in trees etc this one cannot be killed on account of its being allpervasive since the indewelling one cannot be killed although the body of everyone of the livi ng beings be killed tasmat therefore tvam you na arhasi ought not socitum to grieve for sarvani bhutani all these beings for bhisma and others here ie in the earlier verse it has been said that from the standpoint of the supreme reality there is no occasion for sorrow or delusion this is so not merely from the standpoint of the supreme reality but54 231 even considering your own duty you should not waver since there is nothing else better for a ksatriya than a righteous battl e english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 231 api even aveksya considering svadharmam your own duty the duty of a ksatriya viz battle considering even that na arhasi you ought not vikampi tum to waver to deviate from the natural duty of the ksatriya ie from what is natural to yourself and hi since that battle is not devoid of righteousness but is supremely righteous it being conducive to virtue and meant for protection of subje cts through conquest of the earth therefore na vidyate there is nothing anyat else sreyah better ksatriyasya for a ksatriya than that dharmyat righteous yuddhat battle 232 o son of partha happy are the ksatriyas who come across this kind of a battle which presents itself unsought for and which is an open gate to heaven55 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 232 why again does that battle become a duty this is being answered as f ollows a specific rule is more authoritative than a general rule non violence is a general rule enjoined by the scriptures but the duty of fighting is a specific rule for a ksatriya partha o son of partha are not those ksatiryas sukhinah happy h appy in this world as also in the other who labhante come across a yuddham battle idrsam of this kind upapannam which presents itself yadrcchaya unsought for and which is an apavrtam open svarga dvaram gate to heaven rites and duties like sacrifices etc yield their results after the lapse of some time but the ksatriyas go to heaven immediatley after dying in battle because unlike the minds of others their minds remaind fully engaged in their immediate duty 233 on the other hand if you will not fight this righteous battle then forsaking your own duty and fame you will incur sin english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda56 233 atha on the other hand cet if tvam you na karisyasi will not fight even imam this dharmyam righteous samgramam battle which has presented itself as a duty which is not opposed to righteousness and which is enjoined by the scriptures tatah then because of not undertaki ng that hitva forsaking sva dharmam your own duty ca and kritim fame earned from encountering mahadeva lord siva and others avapsyasi you will incur only papam sin 234 people also will speak of your unending infamy and to an honoured pe rson infamy is worse than death english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 234 not only will there be the giving up of your duty and fame but bhutani people ca api also kathayisyanti will speak te of your avyayam unending perpetual akrtim infamy ca and sambhavitasya to an honoured person to a person honoured with such epithets as virtuous heroic etc akirtih infamy atiricyate is worse than57 maranat death the meaning is that to an honoured person death is perferable to infamy 235 the great chariot riders will think of you as having desisted from the fight out of fear and you will into disgrace before them to whom you had been estimable english translation of sri sankarachar yas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 235 moreover maharathah the great chariot riders duryodhana and others mamsyante will think tvam of you as uparatam having desisted ranat from the fight not out of compassion but bhayat out of fear of karna and others ca and yasyasi laghavam you will again fall into disgrace before them before duryodhana and others yesam to whom tvam you bahumato bhutva had been estimable as endowed with many qualities 236 and your enemies will speak many indecent words while denigrating your might what can be more painful than that english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda58 236 ca and besieds tava your ahitah enemies vadisyanti will speak bahun many various kinds of avacya vadan indecent words unutterable words nindantah while denigrating scorning tava your samarthyam might earned from battles against nivatakavaca and others therefore kim nu what can be duhkhataram more pa inful tatah than that than the sorrow arising from being scorned that is to say there is no greater pain than it 237 either by being killed you will attain heaven or by winning you will enjoy the earth therefore o arjuna rise up with determin ation for fighting english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 237 again by undertaking the fight with karna and others va either hatah by being killed prapsyasi you will attain svargam heaven or jitva by winning over karna and other heroes bhoksyase you will enjoy mahim the earth the purport is that in either case you surely stand to gain since this is so kaunteya o son of kunti tasmat therefore uttistha rise up krta niscayah59 with determination yuddhaya for fighting ie with the determination i shall either defeat the enemies or shall d ie 238 treating happiness and sorrow gain and loss and conquest and defeat with equanimity then engage in battle thus you will not incur sin english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 238 as rega rds that listen to this advice for you then you are engaged in battle considering it to be your duty krtva treating sukha duhkhe happiness and sorrow same with equanimity ie without having likes and dislikes so also treating labha alabhau gain and loss jaya ajayau conquest and defeat as the same tatah then yuddhaya yujyasva engage in battle evam thus by undertaking the fight na avapsyasi you will not incur papam sin this advice is incidental the context here is that of the philos ophy of the supreme reality if fighting is enjoined in that context it will amount to accepting combination of knowledge and actions to avoid this contingency the commentator says incidental that is to say60 although the context is of the supreme rea lity the advice to fight is incidental it is not an injunction to combine knowledge with actions since fighting is here the natural duty of arjuna as a ksatriya the generally accepted argument for the removal of sorrow and delusion has been stated in the verses beginning with even considering your own duty 31 etc but this has not been presented by accepting that as the real intention of the lord the real context here in 212 etc however is of the realization of the supreme reality now in order to show the distinction between the two topics dealt with in this scripture the lord concludes that topic which has been presented above in 220 etc by saying this wisdom has been imparted etc for if the distinction between the to pics of the scripute be shown here then the instruction relating to the two kinds of adherences as stated later on in through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization through the yoga of action for the yogis 33 will proceed again smoo thly and the hearer also will easily comprehend it by keeping in view the distinction between the topics hence the lord says 239 o partha this wisdom has been imparted to you from the standpoint of self realization but61 listen to this wisdom from the standpoint of yoga endowed with which wisdom you will get rid of the bondage of action english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 239 partha o son of prtha arjuna esa this buddhih wisdom the kno wledge which directly removes the defect viz ignorance that is responsible for sorrow delusion etc mundane existence consists of attraction and repulsion agentship and enjoyership etc these are the defects and they arise from ignorance about one s self enlightenment is the independent and sole cause that removes this ignorance constituting mundane existence abhihita has been imparted te to you sankhye from the standpoint of self realization with regard to the discriminating knowledge of the supreme reality tu but srnu listen imam to this wisdom which will be imparted presently yoge from the spandpoint of yoga from the standpoint of the means of attaining it knowledge ie in the context of karma yoga the performance of rit es and duties with detachment after destroying the pairs of opposites for the sake of adoring god as also in62 the context of the practice of spiritual absorption as as inducement he the lord praises that wisdom yuktah endowed yaya with which budd hya wisdom concerning yoga o partha prahasyasi you will get rid of karma bandham the bondage of action action is itself the bondage described as righteousness and unrighteousness you will get rid of that bondage by the attainment of knowledge thr ough gods grace this is the idea 240 here there is no waste of an attempt nor is there any harm even a little of this righteousness saves one from great fear english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirana nda 240 moreover iha here in the path to liberation viz the yoga of action rites and duties na there is no abhikrama nasah waste of an attempt of a beginning unlike as in agriculture etc the meaning is that the result of any attempt in the case of yoga is not uncertain besides unlike as in medical care na vidyate nor is there nor does there arises any pratyavayah harm but svalpam api even a little asya of this dharmasya63 righteousness in the form of yoga of action when pracis ed trayate saves one mahato bhayat from great fear of mundance existence characterized by death birth etc 241 o scion of the kuru dynasty in this there is a single one pointed conviction the thoughts of the irresolute ones have many branc hes indeed and are innumerable english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 241 kuru nandana o scion of the kuru dynasty iha is this path to liberation there is only eka a single vyavasayatmika one poin ted buddhih conviction which has been spoken of in the yoga of knowledge and which has the characteristics going to be spoken of in karma yoga it is resolute by nature and annuls the numerous branches of the other opposite thoughts since it origina tes from the right source of knowledge the right source of knowledge viz the vedic texts which are above criticism those again which are the other buddhayah thoughts they are bahu sakhah possessed of numerous branches ie possessed of numerous variations owing to the64 influence of their many branches the worldly state becomes endless limitless unceasing ever growing and extensive endless because it does not cease till the rixe of full enlightenment limitless because the worldly state wh ich is an effect springs from an unreal source but even the worldly state ceases with the cessation of the infinite branches of thoughts under the influence of discriminating wisdom arising from the valid source of knowledge and those thoughts are h i indeed anantah innumerable under every branch whose thoughts avyavasayinam of the irresolute ones ie of those who are devoid of discriminating wisdom arising from the right source of knowledge 242243 o son of prtha those undiscerning pe ople who utter this flowery talk which promises birth as a result of rites and duties and is full of various special rites meant for the

rites kriya are kriya visesah the speech that is full bahula of these the speech by which that is full bahula of these the speech by which these viz objects such as heaven anima ls and sons are revealed plentifully is kriya visesa bahula bhoga enjoyment and aisvarya affluence are bhoga aisvarya their attainment gatih is bhoga aisvarya gatih they utter a speech that is full of the specialized rites prati meant for th at attainment the fools who utter that speech move in the cycle of transmigration this is the idea 244 one pointed conviction does not become established in the minds of those who delight in enjoyment and affluence and whose intellects are carri ed away by that speech english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda67 244 and vyavasayatmika one pointed buddhih conviction with regard to knowledge or yoga na vidhiyate does not become established ie does not arise samadhau in the minds the word samadhi being derived in the sese of that into which everthing is gathered together for the enjoyment of a person bhoga aisvarya prasaktanam of those who delight in enjoyment and wealth of those who have the hankering that only enjoyment as also wealth is to be sought for of those who identify themselves with these and apahrta cetasam of those whose intellects are carried away whose discriminating judgement becomes covered taya by that speech wh ich is full of various special rites 245 o arjuna the vedas meaning only the portion dealing with rites and duties karma kanda have the three qualities as their object you become free from worldliness free from the pairs of duality ever poised in the quality of sattva without desire for acquisition and protection and self collected english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda68 245 to those who are thus devoid of discriminating wisdom who indul ge in pleasure here ast adds yat phalam tad aha what result accrues that the lord states tr o arjuna vedah the vedas traigunya visayah have the three qualities as their object have the three gunas traigunya means the collection of the thre e qualities viz sattva purity rajas energy and tamas darkness ie the collection of virtuous vicious and mixed activities as also their results in this derivative sense traigunya means the worldly life ie the worldly life as the object to be revealed but you bhava become nistraigunyah free from the three qualities ie be free from desires there is a seeming conflict between the advices to be free from the three qualities and to be ever poised in the quality of sattva hence the commentator takes the phrase nistraigunya to mean niskama free from desires be nirdvandvah free from the pairs of duality by the word dvandva duality are meant the conflicting pairs of heat and cold etc which are the causes of happiness and so rrow you become free from them from heat cold etc that is forbear them you become nitya sattvasthah ever poised in the quality of sattva and so also niryoga ksemah without desire for acquisition69 and protection yoga means acquisition of wha t one has not and ksema means the protection of what one has for one who as acquisition and protection foremost in his mind it is difficult to seek liberation hence you be free from acquisition and protection and also be atmavan selfcollected vi gilant this is the advice given to you while you are engaged in your own duty and not from the point of view of seeking liberation 246 a brahmana with realization has that much utility in all the vedas as a man has in a well when there is a flood all around english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 246 if there be no need for the infinite results of all the rites and duties mentioned in the vedas then why should they be performed as a dedication to god listen to the answer being given in the world yavan whatever arthah utility use like bathing drinking etc one has udapane in a well pond and other numerous limited reservoirs all that indeed is achieved ie all those needs are fulfilled to that very extent sampluhtodake when70 there is a flood sarvatah all arount in a similar manner whatever utility result of action there is sarvesu in all the vedesu vedas ie in the rites and duties mentioned in the vedas all that utilit y is achieved ie gets fulfilled tavan to that very extent in that result of realization which comes brahmanasya to a brahmana a sannyasin vijanatah who knows the reality that is the supreme goal that result being comparable to the flood all ar ound for there is the upanisadic text so all virtuous deeds performed by people get included in this onewho knows what he raikva knows ch 414 the lord also will say all actions in their totality culminate in knowledge 433 the c ommentators quotation from the ch relates to meditation on the qualified brahman lest it be concluded that the present verse relates to knowledge of the qualified brahman only he quotes again from the gita toshow that the conclusion holds good in the ca se of knowledge of the absolute brahman as well therefore before one attains the fitness for steadfastness in knowledge rites and duties even though they have limited utility as that of a well pond etc have to be undertaken by one who is fit for rites and duties71 247 your right is for action alone never for the results do not become the agent of the results of action may you not have any inclination for inaction english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gam bhirananda 247 te your adhikarah right is karmani eva for action alone not for steadfastness in knowledge even there when you are engaged in action you have ma kadacana never ie under no condition whatever a right phalesu for the results o f action may you not have a hankering for the results of action whenever you have a hankering for the fruits of action you will become the agent of acquiring the results of action ma do not thus bhuh become karma phalahetuh the agent of acquirin g the results of action for when one engages in action by being impelled by thirst for the results of action then he does become the cause for the production of the results of action ma may you not astu have sangah an inclination akarmani for ina ction thinking if the results of work be not desired what is the need of work which involves pain72 248 by being established in yoga o dhananjaya arjuna undertake actions casting off attachment and remaining equipoised in success and failure equanimity is called yoga english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhir ananda 248 if action is not to be undertaken by one who is under the impulsion of the fruits of action how then are they to be undertaken this is being stated yogasthah by becoming established in yoga o dhanajaya kuru undertake karmani actions for the sake of god alone even there tyaktva casting off sangam attachment in the form god will be pleased with me undertake work for pleasing god but not for propitiating him to become favourable towards yourself undertake actions bhutva remaining samah equipoised siddhi asidhyoh in success and failure even in the success characterized by the attainment of knowledge that arises from the purification of the mind when one performs actions without hankering for the results and in the failure that arises from its opposite ignorance arising from the impurity of the mind what is that yoga with regard to being established in73 which it is said undertake this indeed is that the samatvam equanimity in success and failure ucyate i s called yogah yoga 249 o dhananjaya indeed action is quite inferior to the yoga of wisdom take resort to wisdom those who thirst for rewards are pitiable english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 249 then again o dhananjaya as against action performed with equanimity of mind for adoring god karma action undertaken by one longing for the results is hi indeed durena quite by far avaram inferior very remote buddhi yogat from the yoga of wisdom from actions undertaken with equanimity of mind because it the former is the cause of birth death etc since this is so therefore saranam anviccha take resort to seek shelter buddhau under wisdom which relates to yoga or to the conv iction about reality that arises from its the formers maturity and which is the cause of achieving fearlessness the meaning is that you should resort to the knowledge of the supreme goal because those who under take inferior actions phala hetavah who thirst for rewards74 who are impelled by results are krpanah pitiable according to the sruti he o gargi who departs from this world without knowing this immutable is pitiable br 3810 see note under 27 tr 250 possessed of wisdom one rejects here both virtue and vice therefore devote yourself to karma yoga yoga is skilfulness in action english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 250 listen to the result that one possessed of the wisdom of equanimity attains by performing ones own duties buddhi yuktah possessed of wisdom possessed of the wisdom of equanimity since one jahati rejects iha here in this world ubhe both sukrta duskrte virtue and vice righteousness and unrig hteousness through the purification of the mind and acquisition of knowledge tasmat therefore yujyasva devote yourself yogaya to karma yoga the wisdom of equanimity for yoga is kausalam skilfulness karmasu in action skilfulness means the a ttitude of the skilful the wisdom of equanimity with regard to ones success and failure while engaged in actions karma called ones own duties sva dharma with the mind dedicated to god that indeed is skilfulness75 which through equanimity make s actions that by their very nature bind give up their nature therefore be you devoted to the wisdom of equanimity 251 because those who are devoted to wisdom they becoming men of enlightenment by giving up the fruits produced by actions reach the state beyond evils by having become freed from the bondage of birth english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 251 the words phalam tyaktva by giving up the fruits are connected with the remote word karmajam produced by actions hi because because when actions are performed with an attitude of equanimity it leads to becoming freed from sin etc therefore by stages it becomes the cause of liberation as well buddhi yuktah those who are devot ed to wisdom who are imbued with the wisdom of equanimity they becoming manisinah men of enlightenment tyaktva by giving up phalam the fruit the acquisition of desirable and undesriable bodies desirable the bodies of gods and others undesirab le the bodies76 of animals etc karmajam produced by actions gacchanti reach padam the state the supreme state of visnu called liberation anamayam beyond evils ie beyond all evils by having become janma bandha vinirmuktah freed from the bonda ge of birth birth janma itself is a bondage bandha becoming freed from that even while living or since it buddhi has been mentioned as the direct cause of the elimination of righteousness and unrighteousness and so on therefore what ha s been presented in the three verses beginning with o dhananjayato the yoga of wisdom 49 is enlightenment itself which consists in the realization of the supreme goal which is comparable to a flood all around and which arises from the purifi cation of the mind as a result of karma yoga in the first portion of the commentary buddhi has been taken to mean samattva buddhi wisdom of equanimity the alternative meaning of buddhi has been taken as enlightenment so action is to be performed b y taking the help of the wisdom about the supreme reality which has been chosen as ones goal 252 when your mind will go beyond the turbidity of delusion then you will acquire dispassion for what has to be heard and what has been heard77 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 252 when is attained that wisdom which arises from the purification of the mind brought about by the pursuit of karma yoga this is being stated yada when yada when ma turity of discrimination is attained at the time when te your buddhih mind vyatitarisyati will go beyond cross over moha kalilam the turbidity of delusion the dirt in the form of delusion in the form of non discrimination which after confoun ding ones understanding about the distinction between the self and the not self impels the mind towards objects that is to say when your mind will attain the state of purity tada then tada then when the mind becoming purified leads to the ris e of discrimination which in turn matures into detachment at that time gantasi you will acquire nirvedam despassion for srotavyasya what has to be heard ca and srutasya what has been heard the idea implied is that at that time what has to be heard and what has been heard what has to be heardhas been heard ie the scriptures other than those relating to self knowledge when discrimination referred78 to above gets matured then the fruitlessness of all things other than self knowledge becom es apparent becomes fruitless 253 when your mind that has become bewildered by hearing s takes the word sruti in the sense of the vedas tr will become unshakable and steadfast in the self then you will attain yoga that arises from discrimination english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 253 if it be asked by becoming possessed of the wisdom arising from the discrimina tion about the self after overcoming the turbidity of delusion when shall i attain the yoga of the supreme reality which is the fruit that results from karma yoga then listen to that yada when at the time when te your buddhih mind that has becom e sruti vi pratipanna bewildered tossed about by hearing the vedas that reveal the diverse ends means and their relationship ie are filled with divergent ideas sthasyati will become niscala unshakable free from the trubulence in the form o f distractions and acala steadfast that is to say free from doubt even in that unshakable state79 samadhau in samadhi that is to say in the self samadhi being derived in the sense of that in which the mind is fixed tada then at that time avapsyasi you will attain yogam yoga the enlightenment self absorption that arises from discrimination having got an occasion for inquiry arjuna with a view to knowing the characteristics of one who has the realization of the self by the word samad hi is meant the enlightenment arising from discrimination which has been spoken of in the commentary on the previous verse the steadfastness which the monks have in that enlightenment is called steadfastness in knowledge or the phrase may mean the enlightenment achieved through meditation on the self ie the realization of the supreme goal asked 254 arjuna said o kesava what is the description of a man of steady wisdom who is self absorbed how does the man of steady wisdom speak how do es he sit how does he move about english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda80 254 o kesava ka what is the bhasa description the language for the description how is he described by others sthita prajnasya of a man of steady wisdom of one whose realization i am the supreme brahman remains steady samadhi sthasya of one who is self absorbed or kim how does the sthitadhih dhih man of steady wisdom himself probhaseta speak how does he as ita sit how does he vrajeta move about that is to say of what kind is his sitting or moving through this verse arjuna asks for a description of the man of steady wisdom 255 the blessed said o partha when one fully renounces all the desires that have entered the mind and remains satisfied in the self alone by the self then he is called a man of steady wisdom english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 255 in the verses beginning from when one fully renounces and ending with the completion the chapter instruction about the characteristics of the man of steady wisdom and the disciplines he had to pass through is being given both for the one who has indeed applied himself to steadfastne ss81 in the yoga of knowledge after having renounced rites and duties from the very beginning even while he is in the stage of celibacy and for the one who has applied himself to this after having passed through the path of karma yoga for in all the s criptures without exception dealing with spirituality whatever are the characteristics of the man of realization are themselves presented as the disciplines for an aspirant because these characteristics are the result of effort and those that are th e disciplines requiring effort they become the characteristics of the man of realization there are two kinds of sannyasa vidvat renunciation that naturally follows realization and vividisa formal renunciation for undertaking the disciplines whi ch lead to that realization according to ag the characteristics presented in this and the following verses describe not only the vidvat sannyasin but are also meant as disciplines for the vividisa sannyasin tr o partha yada when at the time when prajahati one fully renounces sarvan all the kaman desires varieties of desires manogatan that have entered the mind entered into the heart if all desires are renounced while the need for maintaining the body persists then in the absence of anything to bring satisfaction there may arise the possibility of82 ones behaving like lunatics or drunkards a lunatic is one who has lost his power of discrimination and a drunkard is one who has that power but ignores it hence it is said tustah remains satisfied atmani eva in the self alone in the very nature of the inmost self atmana by the self which is his own indifferent to external gains and satiated with everything else on account of having attained the nector of realization of the supreme goal tada then ucyate he is called sthita prajnah a man of steady wisdom a man of realization one whose wisdom arising from the discrimination between the self and the not self is stable the idea is that the man of steady wisdom is a mon k who has renounced the desire for progeny wealth and the worlds and who delights in the self and disports in the self 256 that monk is called a man of steady wisdom when his mind is unperturbed in sorrow he is free from longing for delights and has gone beyond attachment fear and anger english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda83 256 moreover that munih monk sankaracarya identifies the monk with the man of realization ucyate is then called sth itadhih a man of steady wisdom when anudvignamanah his mind is unperturbed duhkhesu in sorrow when his mind remains unperturbed by the sorrows that may come on the physical or other planes fever headache etc are physical adhyatmika sorrows sorrows caused by tigers snakes etc are environmental adhibhautika sorrows those caused by cyclones floods etc are super natural adhidaivika similarly delights also may be experienced on the three planes so also when he is vigata sprhah free from longing sukhesu for delights when he unlike fire which flares up when fed with fuel etc has no longing for delights when they come to him and vita raga bhaya krodhah has gone beyond attachment fear and anger 257 the wisdom o f that person remains established who has not attachment for anything anywhere who neither welcomes nor rejects anything whatever good or bad when he comes across it84 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 257 further prajna the wisdom tasya of that person fo that sannyasin pratisthita remains established yah who anabhi snehah has no attachment for sarvatra anything anywhere even for body life etc who na abhinanadati neither welcomes na dvesti nor rejects tat tat anything whatever subha asubham good or bad propya when he comes across it ie who does not rejoice on meeting with the good nor reject the bad on meeting with it of such a person who is thus free from elation or dej ection the wisdom arising from discrimination remains established 258 and when this one fully withdraws the senses from the objects of the senses as a tortoise wholly withdraws the limbs then his wisdom remains established english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 258 and besides yada when ayam this one the sannyasin practising steadfastness in knowledge samharate fully withdraws fully suggests85 absolute firmness in withdrawal and withd raws suggests full control over the organs indriyani the senses indriya arthebhyah from all the objects of the senses iva as kurmah a tortoise sarvasah wholly withdraws angani its limbs from all sides out of fear when the man engaged in steadfastness to knowledge withdraws thus then tasya his prajna wisdom pratisthita remains established the meaning of this portion has already been explained as to that that is so far as the phenomenal world is concerned the organs of a sick person too cease to be active when the refrains from sense objects they get fully withdrawn like the limbs of a tortoise but not so the hankering for those objects how that hankering gets completely withdrawn is being stated 259 the objec ts recede from an abstinent man with the exception of the taste for them even the taste of this person falls away after realization the absolute english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda86 259 although vis ayah the objects ie the organs figuratively implied and expressed by the word objects or the objects themselves vinivartante recede niraharasya dehinah from an abstinent man from an embodied being even from a fool who engages in painful au sterity and abstains from objects still they do so rasavarjam with the exception of the taste for them with the exception of the hankering that one has for objects the word rasa is well known as referring to the sense of taste hankering as in s uch expressions as sva rasena pravrttah induced by his own taste ie willingly rasikah a man of tastes rasajnah a connoisseur of tastes etc api even that rasah taste of the nature of subtle attachment asya of this person of the san nyasin nivartate falls away ie his objective perception becomes seedless when drstva after attaining param the absolute the reality which is the supreme goal brahman he continues in life with the realization i verily am that brahman in th e absence of full realization there can be no eradication of the hankering the idea conveyed is that one should therefore stabilize ones wisdom which is characterized by full realization if it be held that attachment cannot be eliminated without the knowledge of brahman and at the same time that the knowledge of87 brahman cannot arise until attachment is eradicated then we get involved in a vicious circle in answer it is said that gross attachments are eliminated through discrimination which restrai ns the senses from being overpowered by objects and the full knowledge arising thereof eliminates the subtle inclinations as well hence there is no vicious circle involved since the organs have to be first brought under his own control by one who desir es to establish firmly the wisdom which is characterized by full realization therefore the lord speaks of the evil that arises from not keeping them under control 260 for o son of kunti the turbulent organs violently snatch away the mind of an inte lligent person even while he is striving diligently english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 260 hi for kaunteya o son of kunti pramathini the turbulent indriyani organs prasabham violently haran ti snatch away manah the mind vipascitah of an intelligent purusasya person api even yatatah while he is striving diligently repeatedly being mindful of the evils that arise88 from sense objects or the words purusasya vipascitah of an in telligent person are to be connected with the remote word api even the commentator says that api may be construed either with yatatah or with vipascitah purusasya tr indeed the organs confound a person who is inclined towards objects and after co nfounding him violently carry away his mind endowed with discriminating knoweldge even when he is aware of this since this is so therefore 261 controlling all of them one should remain concentrated on me as the supreme for the wisdom of one whos e organs are under control becomes steadfast english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 261 samyamya controlling having subdued sarvani all tani of them asita one should remain yuktah concentrated matparah on me as the supreme he to whom i vasudeva the inmost self of all am the supreme parah is mat parah the idea is he should remain concentrated thinking i am not different from him hi for the prajna wisdom tasya of one of the sannyasin remaining thus concentrated yasya whose89 indriyani organs are vase under control by dint of practice the organs come under control either by constantly thinking of oneself as non different from the self or by constantly being mindful of the evils that result from objects pratisthita becomes steadfast now then is being stated this thiswhat is described in the following two verses and is also a matter of common experience root cause of all the evils that beset one who is the ve rge of being overwhelmed 262263 in the case of a person who dwells on objects there arises attachment for them from attachment grows hankering from hankering springs anger english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami

present verse is an answer to this apprehension 263 from anger follows delusion from delusion failur e of memory from failure of memory the loss of understanding from the loss of understanding he

he has to move about for food which is necessary for the maintenance of his body the present verse is an answer to this apprehension93 264 but by perceiving objects with the organs that are free from attraction and repulsion and are under his own control the self controlled man attains serenity english translation of sri sankara charyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 264 certainly the functions of the organs are naturally preceded by attraction and repulsion this being so caran by perceiving visayan objects which are unavoidable indriyaih with the organs suc h as ears etc raga dvesa viyuktaih that are free from those attraction and repulsion and are atma vasyaih under his own control vidheya atma ag takes atma vasyaih in the sense of with the organs under the control of the mind he then argues t hat it the mind be not under control there can be no real control over the organs hence the text uses the second expression vidheyatma whose mind can be subdued at will here atma is used in the sense of the mind according to the commentator himsel f the self controlled man whose mind can be subdued at will a seeker after liberation adhigacchati attains prasadam serenity self poise what happens when there is serenity this is being answered94 265 when there is serenity there follows eradication of all his sorrows because the wisdom of one who has a serene mind soon becomes firmly established english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 265 prasade when there is serenity upajayate there f ollows hanih eradication asya sarva duhkhanam of all his the sannyasins sorrow on the physical and other planes moreover this is so hi because buddhih the wisdom prasanna cetasah of one who has a serene mind of one whose mind is poised in the self asu soon pari avatisthate becomes firmly established remains steady avatisthate totally pari like the sky ie it becomes unmoving in its very nature as the self the meaning of the sentence is this since a person with such a poised mi nd and well established wisdom attains fulfilment therefore a man of concentration a man who is free whom slavery to objects of the senses ought to deal with the indispensable and scripturally non forbidden objects through his senses that are free from love and hatred that same serenity is being eulogized95 266 for the unsteady there is no wisdom and there is no meditation for the unsteady man and for an unmeditative man there is no peace how can there be happiness for one without peace engli sh translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 266 ayuktasya for the unsteady for one who does not have a concentrated mind na asti there is no ie there does not arise buddhih wisdom with regard to the nature o f the self ca and there is no bhavana meditation earnest longing longing to have a continuous remembrance of the knowledge of brahman which arises in the mind from hearing the great upanisadic sayings maha vakyas for the knowledge of the self ay uktasya for an unsteady man and similarly abhavayatah for an unmeditative man who does not ardently desire the knowledge of the self there is no santih peace restraint of the senses kutah how can there be sukham happiness asantasya for one wi thout peace that indeed is happiness which consists in the freedom of the senses from the thirst for enjoyment of objects not the thirst for objects that is misery to be sure the implication is that so96 long as thirst persists there is no possibilit y of even an iota of happiness it is being stated why a man without concentration does not possess wisdom 267 for the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses that mind carries away his wisdom like the mind diverting a boat on the waters 267 hi for yat manah the mind which anu vidhiyate follows in the wake of caratam the wanderi ng indriyani senses that are tending towards their respective objects tat that the mind engaged in thinking perceiving objects like sound etc in their respective varieties of the objects of the senses harati carries away destroys asya his the sannyasins prajnam wisdom born from the discrimination between the self and the not self how iva like vayuh the wind diverting a navam boat ambhasi on the waters as wind by diverting a boat on the waters from its intended course drives it along a wrong course similarly the mind by diverting the wisdom from the pursuit of the self makes it engage in objects after having stated variously the reasons for the idea conveyed through the verse for o son of kunti97 etc 60 and having esta blished that very idea the lord concludes thus 268 therefore o mighty armed one this wisdom becomes established whose organs in all their varieties are withdrawn from their objects english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit comme ntary swami gambhirananda 268 since the evils arising from the activities of the organs have been described tasmat therefore mahabaho o mighty armed one tasya his the sannyasins prajna wisdom pratisthita becomes established yasya whose indriyani organs sarvasah in all their varieties differentiated as mind etc nigrhitani are withdrawn indriya arthebhyah from their objects such as sound etc in the case of a man of steady wisdom in whom has arisen discriminating knowledge those which are these ordinary and vedic dealings cease on the eradication of ignorance they being effects of ignorance and ignorance ceases because it is98 opposed to knowledge for clarifying this idea the lord says 269 the self restrained man keeps awa ke during that which is night for all creatures that during which creatures keep awake it is night to the seeing sage 269 ya that which sarva bhutanam for all creatures is nisa night which being darkness tamah by nature obliterates distinc tions among all things what is that that is the reality which is the supreme goal accessible to the man of steady wisdom as that which verily appears as day to the nocturnal creatures is night for others similarly the reality wich is the supreme goal appears to be night as it were to all unenlightened beings who are comparable to the nocturnal creatures because it is beyond the range of vision of those who are devoid of that wisdom samyami the self restrained man whose organs are under control ie the yogi the man of realization who has arisen from the sleep of ignorance jagarti keeps awake tasyam in that night characterized as the reality the supreme goal that night of ignorance characterized by the distinctions of subjects and objects yasyam in which bhutani the creatures99 who are really asleep are said to be jagrati keeping awake in which night they are like dreamers in sleep sa nisa it is night pasyatah to the seeing muneh sage who perceives the reality that is the su preme goal because that night is ignorance by nature therefore rites and duties are enjoined only during the state of ignorance not in the state of enlightenment for when knowledge dawns ignorance becomes eradicated like the darkness of night afte r sun rise it may be argued that even after illumination the phenomenal world though it is known to be false will continue to be perceived because of the persistence of past impressions therefore there is scope for the validity of the scriptural injun ctions even in the case of an illumined soul the answer is that there will be no scope for the injunctions because the man of realization will then have no ardent leaning towards this differentiated phenomenal world which makes an injunction relevant b efore the rise of knowledge ignorance accepted as a valid means of knowledge and presenting itself in the different forms of actions means and results becomes the cause of all rites and duties it cannot reasonably become the source of rites and duties after realization when it is understood as an invalid means of knowledge for an agent becomes100 engaged in actions when he has the idea actions have been enjoined as a duty for me by the vedas which are a valid means of knowledge but not when he und erstands that all this is mere ignorance like the night again the man to whom has come the knowledge that all these differences in their totality are mere ignorance like the night to that man who has realized the self there is eligibility only for r enouncing all actions not for engaging in actions in accordance with this the lord will show in the verse those who have their intellect absorbed in that whose self is that 517 etc that he has competence only for steadfastness in knowledge obje ction may it not be argued that there will be no reason for being engaged even in that steadfastness in knowledge if there be no valid means of knowledge vedic injunctions to impel one to that because without an injunction nobody would engage in a duty much less in steadfastness to knowledge answer no since knowledge of the self relates to ones own self indeed by the very fact that it is the self and since the validity of all the means of knowledge culminates in it the validity of all the means of knowledge holds good only so long as the knowledge of the self has not arisen therefore the self does not depend on an injunction to impel101 it towards itself does the injunction relate to the knowledge of the self or to the self itself t he first alternative is untenable because a valid means of knowledge reveals its objects even without an injunction the second alternative also is untenable because the self is self revealing whereas an injunction is possible in the case of something yet to be achieved and ones own self is not an object of that kind surely after the realization of the true nature of the self there is no scope again for any means to or end of knowledge the last valid means of self knowledge eradicates the possi bility of the selfs becoming a perceiver and even as it eradicates it loses its own authoritativeness in the same way as the means of knowledge which is valid in dream becomes unauthoritative during the waking state in the world too after the precep tion of an abject the valid means of that perception is not seen to be a cause impelling the knower to any action with regard to that object hence it is established that for an knower of the self there remains no eligibility for rites and duties th e attainment of liberation is only for the sannyasin liberation is attained only by one who after acquiring an intellectual knowledge of the self in a general way is endowed with discrimination and detachment102 has arisen above all desires has become a monk in the primary sense and has directly realized the self by going through the process of sravana understanding of upanisadic texts about the self etc the man of enlightenment who has renounced all desires and is a man of steady wisdom but not for him who has not renounced and is desirious of the objects of the senses such being the case with a view to establishing this with the help of an illustration the lord says 270 that man attains peace into whom all desires enter in the same way as the waters flow into a sea that remains unchanged even when being filled up from all sides not so one who is desirous of objects english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 270 sah that man apnoti att ains santim peace liberation yam into whom into which person sarve all kamah desires all forms of wishes pravisanti enter from all directions like waters entering into a sea without overwhelming him even in the presence of objects they vani sh in the self they do not bring it under their own influence tadvat in the same way yadvat as apah waters103 coming from all sides pravisanti flow into samudram a sea that remains acala pratistham unchanged that continues to be its own self without any change apuryamanam even when filled up from all sides with water na not so the other who is kama kami desirous of objects kama means objects which are sought after he who is given to desire them is kama kami the idea implied is that h e never attains peace since this is so therefore 271 that man attains peace who after rejecting all desires moves about free from hankering without the idea of me and mine and devoid of pride english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 271 sah puman that man who has become thus the sannyasin the man of steady wisdom the knower of brahman adhi gacchati attains santim peace called nirvana consisting in the cessation of all the sorrows of mundane existence ie he becomes one with brahman yah who vihaya after rejecting sarvan all kaman desires without a trace fully carati moves about ie wanders about making efforts only for maintaining the body nihsprhah free from hank ering becoming104 free from any longing even for the maintenance of the body nirmamah without the idea of me and mine without the deeprooted idea of mine even when accepting something needed merely for the upkeep of the body and nir ahankarah de void of pride ie free from self esteem owing to learning etc this steadfastness in knowledge which is such is being praised 272 o partha this is the state of being established in brahman one does not become deluded after attaining this one attains identification with brahman by being established in this state even in the closing years of ones life english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 272 o partha esa this the aforesaid is brahmisthitih the state of being established in brahman ie continuing in life in indentification with brahman after renouncing all actions na vimuhyati one does not become deluded prapya after attaining enam this rcchati one attains brahma nirvanam identification with brahman liberation sthitva by being established asyam in105 this in the state of brahman hood as described api e ven anta kale in the closing years of ones life what need it be said that one who remains established only in brahman during the whole life after having espoused monasticism even from the stage of celibacy attains indetification with brahman106 chapter 3 31 arjuna said o janardana krsna if it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action why they do you urge me to horrible aciton o kesava english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 31 o janardana cet if it be te your mata opinion intention that buddhih wisdom jyayasi is superior karmanah to action if the combination of wisdom and action be intended by the lord then the means to liberation is only one the path combini ng wisdom and action in that case arjuna would have done something illogical in separating wisdom from action by saying that wisdom is superior to action for that wisdom or action which is a constituent of the combination cannot be greater than tha t combination even from the point of view of the result since what is intended is a combination therefore the separation of knowledge from action from the point of view of the result is not justifiable when knowledge and action are considered to form together a single means to liberation in that case each of them cannot be considered separately as producing its107 own distinct result arjunas question can be justified only if this separation were possible similarly what arjuna said by way of cen suring the lord as it were in it has been stated by the lord that wisdom is superior to action and he exhorts me saying undertake action which is a source of evil what may be the reason for this and also in tatkim why then o kesava niyoja yasi do you urge mam me to ghore horrible cruel karmani action involving injury that censure also does not become reasonable on the other hand if the opponents view be that knowledge is to be combined with rites and duties sanctioned by th e vedas and the smrtis in the case of the householders only whereas for others those sanctioned by the smrtis alone are to be combined with knowledge then if it be supposed that the combination of knowledge with action sanctioned only by the smr tis has been enjoined for all by the lord and arjuna also comprehended accordingly then how can the statement why then do you urge me to horrible action be rational besides 32 you bewilder my understanding as it were by a seemingly confli cting statement tell me for108 certain one of these by which i may attain the highest good english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 32 though the lord speaks lucidly still to me who am of a dull understand ing the lords utterance appears to be conflicting mohayasi you bewilder me any buddhim understanding iva as it were vyamisrena iva by that seemingly conflicting vakyena statement you have surely undertaken to dispel the confusion of my understanding but why do you bewildered it hence i say you bewildered my understanding as it were however if you in some readings tvam tu however you is substituted by tatra as to that tr think that it is impossible for a single person to pursue both knowledge and action which can be undertaken only by different persons then that being the case vada tell me niscitya for certain tadekam one of these either knowledge or action this indeed is fit for arjuna according to his u nderstanding strength and situation yena by which by one of either knowledge or action aham i apnuyam may attain sreyah the highest good even if109 knowledge had been spoken of at all by the lord as being subsidiary to steadfastness in action ho w then could there be the desire in arjuna to know of only one of them as expressed in tell me one of these two certainly the lord did not say i shall speak of only one among knowledge and action but surely not of both owing to which arjuna cons idering it impossible for himself to acquire both should have prayed for one only the answer was in accordance witht the question 33 the blessed lord said o unblemished one two kinds of steadfastness in this world were spoken of by me in the day s of yore through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization through the yoga of action for the yogis english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 33 anagha o unblemished one o sinless one this word of address suggests that arjuna is qualified to receive the lords instruction dvividha two kinds of nistha steadfastness persistence in what is undertaken asmin loke in this world for the people of the three castes who are qualified for following the scriptures prokta110 were spoken of maya by me the omniscient god who had revealed for them the traditional teachings of the vedas which are the means of securing prosperity and the highest goal pura in the days of yore in the beginning the creation after having brought into being the creatures now then which is that steadfastness of two kinds in answer the lord says the steadfastness jnanayogena through the yoga of knowledge knowle dge itself being the yoga here jnana knowledge refers to the knowledge of the supreme reality and yoga is used in the derivative sense of that knowledge through which one gets united with brahman had been stated sankhyanam for the men of reali zation those possessed of the knowledge arising from the discrimination with regard to the self and the not self those who have espoused monasticism from the stage of celibacy itself those to whom the entity presented by the vedantic knowledge has becom e fully ascertained see mu 326 the monks who are known as the parama hamsas those who are established in brahman alone and the steadfastness karma yogena through the yoga of action action itself being the yoga yoga here means that through which one gets united with comes to have prosperity ie such actions as go111 by the name of righteousness and are prescribed by the scriptures had been stated yoginam for the yogis the men of action rites and duties this is the idea again had it been intended or stated or if it will be stated in the gita by the lord and if it has also been so stated in the vedas that knowledge and action are to be practised in combination by one and the same person for attaining the same human goal why then should he here tell his dear supplicant arjuna that steadfastness in either knowledge or action is to be practised only by different persons who are respectively qualified if on the other hand it be supposed that the lords idea is after hearing about both kn owledge and action arjuna will himself practise them in combination but to others i shall speak of them as being meant to be pursued by different persons then the lord would be imagined to be unreliable being possessed of likes and dislikes and t hat is untenable so from no point of view whatsoever can there be a combination of knowledge and action and what has been said by arjuna regarding superiority of wisdom over action that stands confirmed for not having been refuted and it also stands confirmed that steadfastness in knowledge is suitable for being practised by monks alone and from the statement that they112 knowledge and action are to be followed by different persons it is understood that this has the lords approval noticing that ar juna had become dejected under the impression you are urging me to that very action which is a source of bondage and was thinking thus i shall not undertake action the lord said na karmanam anarambhat not by abstaining from action etc or whe n steadfastness in knowledge and steadfastness in action become incapable of being pursued simultaneously by one and the same person owing to mutual contradiction then since it may be concluded that they become the cause of attaining the human goal indep endently of each other therefore in order to show that the steadfastness in action is a means to the human goal not independently but by virtue of being instrumental in securing steadfastness in knowledge and that on the other hand steadfastness in knowledge having come into being through the means of steadfastness in action leads to the human goal independently without anticipating anything else the lord said 34 a person does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from action nor doe s he attain fulfilment merely through renunciation113 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 34 purusah a person na does not asnute attain naiskarmyam freedom from action the state of being free f rom action steadfastness in the yoga of knowledge ie the state of abiding in ones own self which is free from action anarambhat by abstaining karmanam from actions by the non performance of actions such as sacrifices etc which are or were perform ed in the present or past lives which are the causes of the purification of the mind by way of attenuating the sins incurred and which by being the cause of that purification become the source of steadfastness in knowledge through the generation of k nowledge as stated in the smrti text knowledge arises in a person from the attenuation of sinful acts the whole verse is jnanam utpadyate pumsamksayatpapasya karmanah yathadarsatalaprakhye pasyatyatmanamatmani knowledge arisesacts one sees t he self in oneself as does one see oneself in a cleaned surface of a mirror tr mbh sa 2048 this is the import from the statement114 that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions it may be concluded that one attains free dom from action by following the opposite course of performing actions what again is the reason that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions the answer is because performing actions is itself a means to freedom from action indeed there can be no attainment of an end without its means and karma yoga is the means to the yoga of knowledge characterized by freedom from action because it has been so established in the upanisads and here as well as for the upanisads it has been shown in the texts the brahmanas seek to know it through the study of the vedas sacrifices charity and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense objects br 4422 etc whch deal with the means of realizing the goal of know ledge under discussion viz the realm of the self that the yoga of karma is a means to the yoga of knowledge and even here in the gita the lord will established that but o mighty armed one renunciation is hard to attain without karma yoga 56 by giving up attachment the yogis undertake workfor the purification of themselves 511 sacrifice charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise 185 etc objection is it not115 that in such texts as extending to all creatures immunity from fear na par 543 one should take recourse to freedom from action it is shown that attainment of freedom from action follows even from the renunciation of obligatory duties and in the world too it is a better known fact that freed om from action follows abstention from actions hence also arises the question why should one who desires freedom from action undertake action reply therefore the lord said na ca nor samadhi gacchati does he attain siddhim fulfilment steadfastne ss in the yoga of knowledge characterized by freedom from action sannyasanat eva merely through renunciation even from the mere renunciation of actions which is devoid of knowledge what again is the reason that by the mere giving up of actions which is not accompanied with knowledge a person does not attain fulfulment in the form of freedom from actions to this query seeking to know the cause the lord says 35 because no one ever remains even for a moment without doing work for all are made to work under compulsion by the gunas born of nature116 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 35 hi because na kascit no one jatu ever tisthati remains api even for so much time as a ksanam momen t akarma krt without doing work why hi for sarvah all creatures karyate karma are made to work verily avasah under compulsion gunaih by the gunas sattva goodness rajas activity and tamas mental darkness prakrti jaih born of nature t he word unenlightened has to be added to the sentence since the men of realzation have been spoken of separately in who is not distracted by the three gunas qualities 1423 for karma yoga is meant only for the unenlightened nor for the men of knowledge karma yoga on the other hand is not pertinent for the men of knowledge who because of their not moving away from their own self are not shaken by the gunas this has been explained similarly in he who has known this one as indestructible 221 but if one who is not a knower of the self does not perform prescribed action then this is certainly bad hence the lord says117 36 one who after withdrawing the organs of action sits mentally recollecting the objects of the senses that one of deluded mind is called a hypocrite english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 36 yah one who samyamya after withdrawing karma indriyani the organs of action hands etc aste sits manasa mentally s maran recollecting thinking indriya arthan the objects of the senses sah that one vimudha atma of deluded mind ucyate is called mithya acarah a hypocrite a sinful person 37 but o arjuna one who engages in karma yoga with the organs of ac tion controlling the organs with the mind and becoming unattached that one excels english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 37 tu but on the other hand o arjuna yah one who is unenlightened and who is eligible for action arabhate engages in what does he engage in the lord says in answer karma yogam karma118 yoga karma indriyaih with the organs of action with speech hands etc niyamya controlling indriyani the sense organs manasa with the mind and becoming asaktah unattached here ast adds phalabhisandhi varjitah free from hankering for results tr sah that one visisyate excels the other one the hypocrite this being so therefore 38 you perform the obligatory duties for ac tion is superior to inaction and through inaction even the maintenance of your body will not be possible english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 38 tvam you o arjuna kuru perform niyatam the obligatory karma duties those daily obligatory duties nitya karmas or which one is competent according to the scriptures and which are not heard of although no result of daily obligatory duties is mentioned in the scriptures still sankaracarya holds that it is either heaven or purification of the heart because something done must have its consequence tr as productive of any result hi for from the point of view of result karma action is jyayah superior akarmanah to119 inaction to non performance of duties why ca and akarmanah through inaction api even te sarira yatra the maintenance of your body na prasiddhyet will not be possible therefore the distinction between action and in action is abvious in this world and as regards your ideea that action should not be udnertaken because it leads to bondage that too is wrong how 39 this man becomes bound by actions other than that action meant for god without being attach ed o son of kunti you perform actions for him english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 39 ayam this lokah man the one who is eligible for action karma bandhanah becomes bound by actions the person who has karma as his bondage bandhana is karma bandhanah anyatra other than that karmanah action yajnarthat meant for got not by that meant for god according to the vedic text sacrifice is verily visnu tai sam 174 yajnah means god what ever is done for him is yajnartham therefore mukta sangah without being attached being free from attachment to the results of actions o son of kunti samacara120 you perform karma actions tadartham for him for god an eligible person should engage in work for the following reason also 310 in the days of yore having created the beings together with the sacrifices prajapati said by this you multiply let this be your yielder of coveted objects of desire english translation of sri sankara charyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 310 pura in the days of yore in the beginning of creation srstva having created prajah the beings the people of the three castes saha yajnah together with the sacrifices prajapati the creator of beings uvaca said anena by this sacrifice prasavisyadhvam you multiply prasava means origination growth you accomplish that esah astu let this sacrifice be vah your ista kama dhuk yielder of coveted objects of desire that which yiel ds dhuk coveted ista objects of desire kama particular results is istakama dhuk how 311 you nourish the gods with this let those gods nourish you nourishing one another you shall attain the supreme good121 english translation of sri san karacharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 311 bhavayata you nourish devan the gods indra and others anena with this sarifice let te devah those gods bhavayantu nourish vah you make you contented with rainfall etc thus bhavayan tah nourishing parasparam one another avapsyatha you shall attain the param supreme sreyah good called liberation through the attainment of knowledge or you shall attain heaven which is meant by param sreyah the param sreyah supreme goo d will either mean liberation or heaven in accordance with aspirants hankering for liberation or enjoyment moreover 312 being nourished by sacrifices the gods will indeed give you the coveted enjoyments he is certainly a theif who enjoys what have been given by them without offering these to them english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 312 yajna bhavitah being nourished ie being satisfied by sacrifices devah the gods dasyante122 hi wi ll indeed give will distribute among vah you the istan coveted bhogan enjoyments such as wife childeren and cattle sah he is eva certainly a stenah thief a stealer of the wealth of gods and others yah who bhunkte enjoys gratifies only his own body and organs with dattan what enjoyable things have been given taih by them by the gods apradaya without offering these ebhyah to them ie without repaying the debt the three kinds of debt to the gods to the rsis sage and to th e manes are repaid by satisfying them through sacrifices celibacy including study of the vedas etc and procreation respectively unless one repays these debts he incurs sin to them 313 by becoming partakers of the remembers of sacrifices they become freed from all sins but the unholy persons who cook for themselves they incur sin english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 313 those again who are yajna sista asinah partakers of the remnants of sacrifices who after making offering to the gods and others the123 panca maha yajnas five great offerings which have to be made by every householder are offerings to gods manes humans cr eatures and rsis sages are habituated to eat the remnants of those offerings called nectar they santah by being so mucyante become freed sarva kilbisaih from all sins from those sins incurred through the five things the five things are ov en water pot cutting instruments grinding machines and broom a householder incurs sin by killing insects etc with these things knowingly or unknowingly it is atoned by making the aforesaid five offerings viz oven etc and also from those others incurred owing to injury etc caused inadvertently tu but the papah unholy persons who are selfish ye who pacanti cook atma karanat for themselves te they being themselves sinful bhunjate incur agham sin for the following reasons also ac tions should be undertaken by an eligible person action is definitely the cause of the movement of the wheel of the world how this is being answered 314 from food are born the creatures the origin of food is from rainfall rainfall originates fro m sacrifice sacrifice has action as its origin124 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 314 it is a matter of direct perception that annat from food which is eaten and is transformed into blood and seme n bhavanti are born bhutani the creatures anna sambhavah the origin of food is parjanyat from rainfall parjanyah rainfall bhavati originates from yajnat from sacrifice this accords with the smrti the oblations properly poured into fire rea ches the sun from the sun comes rain from rain comes food and from the sun comes rain from rain comes food and from that the creatures masm376 here sacrifice means its unique also termed as the unseen result adrsta tr result and that s acrifice ie the unique result which arises samudbhavah from action karma undertaken by the priest and the sacrificer is karma samudbhavah it has action for its origin 315 know that actin has the veda as its origin the vedas has the immutab le as its source hence the allpervading veda is for ever based on sacrifice125 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 315 again a different reading in place of this is tat ca vividham karma kuto jatam ityaha from where did those various kinds of action originate in reply the lord says still another reading is tat ca karma brahmodbhavam iti aha and the lord says that action has the vedas as its origin vide aa 1936 p 116 astekars readi ng is tat ca evam vidham karma kuto jatamityaha and from where has this kind of aciton originated the answers this tr viddhi know that karma action is brahmodbhavam it has brahma the veda as its udbhavam origin here ast adds revealer tr further brahma called the veda is aksara samudbhavam it has aksara the immutable brahman the supreme self as its source this is the meaning since the veda came out like the breath of a man from the supreme self itself called the immutable therefore the veda being the revealer of everything is sarva gatam all pervading even though all pervading the veda is nityam for ever pratisthitam based yajne on sacrifice because the injunctions about sacrifices predominate in it126 316 o p artha he lives in vain who does not follow here the wheel thus set in motion whose life is sinful and who indulges in the senses english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 316 o partha sah he jivati lives mogham in vain yah who though competent for action na anuvartayati does not follow iha here in the world cakram the wheel of the world evam thus pravartitam set in motion by god on the basis of the vedas and the sacrifices aghayuh whose life ayuh is sinful agham ie whose life is vile and indriya aramah who indulges in the senses who has his arama sport enjoyment with objects indriyaih through the senses therefore the gist of the topic under discussion is that action must be undertaken by one who is qualified for action but is unenlightened in the verses beginning from a person does not attain freedom from action by adstaining from action 4 and ending with you perform the obligatory dutiesand through inaction even the maintenance of your body will not be possible 8 it has been proved that before one attains fitness for steadfastness in the127 knowledge of the self it is the bounden duty of a person who is qualified for action but is not enlightened to undertake karma yoga for that purpose and then also in the verses commencing from this man becomes bound by actions other than that action meant for god 9 and ending with o partha he lives in vain many reasons such as that it pleases god secures the affection of the gods and so on have been incidentally stated as to why a competent person has to undertake actions and the evils arising from their nonperformance have also been emphatically declared such being the conclusion the questi on arises whether the wheel thus set in motion should be followed by all or only by one who is ignorant of the self and has not attained to the steadfastness which is fit to be practised by the sankhyas the knowers of the self through the yoga of knowle dge only and which is acquired by one ignorant of the self through the means of the practice of karma yoga mentioned above either anticipating arjunas question to this effect or in order to make the meaning of the scripture gita clearly understood t he lord revealing out of his own accord that the following substance of the upanisads becoming freed from false knowledge by knowing this very self the brahmanas renounce128 what is a compulsory duty for those having false knoweldge viz desire for sons e tc and then lead a mendicant life just for the purpose of maintaining the body they have no duty to perform other than steadfastness in the knowledge of the self cf br 351 has been presented here in the gita says 317 but that man who rejoic es only in theself and is satisfied with the self and is contented only in the self for him there is no duty to perform english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 317 tu but that manavah man the sannyasin the man of knowledge steadfast in the knowledge of the self yah who atmaratih eva syat rejoices only in the self not in the sense objects and atma trptah who is satisfied only with the self not with food and drink and is santustah contented eva only atmani in the self tasya for him na vidyate there is no karyam duty duty with a view to securing liberation to perform rati trpti and santosa though synonymous are used to indicate variou s types of pleasures or rati means attachment to objects trpti means happiness arising from contact with some particular object129 and santosa means happiness in general arising from the acquisition of some coveted object only all people surely feel co ntened by acquiring an external thing but this one without depending on it remains contented only with the self thta is to say he remains detached from everything the idea it that for a man who is such a knower of the self there is no duty to under take 318 for him there is no concern here at all with performing action nor any concern with nonperformance moreover for him there is no dependence on any object to serve any purpose english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit comment ary swami gambhirananda 318 moreover tasya for him who rejoices in the supreme self na there is no artham concern eva at all krtena with performing action objection in that case let there be some evil called sin owing to nonperformance reply iha here in this world na nor is there for him kascana any concern akrtena with nonperfromance certainly there is no evil in the form of incurring sin or in the form of selfdestruction ca moreover asya for him na asti there is no kascit artha vyapasrayah sarva130 bhutesu dependence on any object from brahma to an unmoving thing to serve any purpose vyapasrayah is the same as vyapasrayanam dependence which is possible of being created by action promted by necessity for him th ere is no end to gain by depending on any praticular object due to which there can be some action for that purpose you arjuna are not established in this fullest realization which is comparable to a flood all around 319 therefore remaining una ttached always perform the obligatory duty for by performing ones duty without attachment a person attains the highest english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 319 since this is so therefore asakta h remaining unattached samacara perform satatam always karyam the obligatory daily karma duty hi for acaran by performing ones karma duty asaktah without attachment by doing work as a dedication to god purusah a person apnoti attai ns param the highest liberation through the purification of the mind this is meaning and131 you should perform your duty for the following reason also 320 for janaka and others strove to attain liberation through action itself you ought to perform your duties keeping also in view the prevention of mankind from going astray english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 320 hi for in the olden days the leaned ksatriyas janakadayah janaka and oth ers such as asvapati asthitah strove to attain samsiddim liberation karmana eva through action itself if it be that they were possessed of the fullest realization then the meaning is that they remained established in liberation whlile continuing b ecause of past momentum to be associated with action itself without renouncing it with a veiw to preventing mankind from going astray again if it be that janaka and others had not attained fullest realization then they gradually became established i n liberation through action which is a means for the purification of the mind the verse is to be explained thus on the other hand if you132 think obligatory duty was performed even by janaka and others of olden days who were surely unenlightened ajanad bhih this is also translated as surely because they were unenlightened tr there by it does not follow that action has to be undertaken by somebody else who has the fullest enlightenment and has reached his goal nevertheless tvam you who are und er the influence of past actions arhasi ought kartum to perform your duties sampasyan api keeping also in view loka sangraham vsa gives the meanings of the phrase as the welfare of the world and propitiation of mankind tr the preventi on of mankind from going astray even that purpose by whom and how is mankind to be prevented from going astray that is being stated in ast this introductory sentence is as followsloka samgrahah kimartham kartavyam iti ucyate tr 321 whateve r a superior person does another person does that very thing whatever he upholds as authority an ordinary person

prevention of people from going astray neither for me who am a knower of the self nor for any other knowe r of the self who wants thus prevent people from going astray is there any duty apart from working for the welfare of the world hence the following advice is being given to such a knower of the self 326 the enlightened man should not create disturbance in the beliefs of the ignorant who are attached to work working while himself remaining deligen some translate yuktah as in the right manner s takes it in the sense of yoga137 yuktah merged in yoga tr he should make them do another read

do sarva karmani all the duties how does an anillumined ignorant person be come attached to actions in reply the lord says 327 while actions are being done in every way by the gunas qualities of nature one who is deluded by egoism thinks thus i am the doer english transla tion of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda138 327 karmani kriyamanani while actions secular and scriptural are being done sarvasah in ever way gunaih by the gunas ie by the modifications in the form of body and organs born prakrteh of nature nature otherwise known as pradhana pradhana maya the power of god being the state of equilibrium of the three qualities of sattva rajas and tamas ahankara vimudha atma one who is deluded by egoism manyate thinks iti thus aham karta i am the doer ahankara is self identification with the aggregate of body and organs he whose atma mind is vimudham diluded in diverse ways by that ahankara is ahankara vimudha atma he who imagines the characteristics of th e body and organs to be his own who has self identification with the body and the organs and who through ignorance believes the activities to be his own he thinks i am the doer of those diverse activities 328 but o mighty armed one the one w ho is a knower of the facts about the varieties of the gunas qualities and actions does not become attached thinking thus the organs

facts knower of what kinds of facts guna karma vibhagayoh about the varieties of the gunas and actions ie a knower of the diversity of the gunas and the diversity of acitons guna vibhaga means the

itself the disturbance that he should not do this is the idea again in what manner should duties be under taken by a seeker after liberation who is not enlightened who is qualified for actions rites and duties as to this the ans wer is being stated 330 devoid of the fever of the soul engage in battle by dedicating all actions to me with your mind intent on the self and becoming free from expectations and egoism english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit comme ntary swami gambhirananda 330 vigata jvarah devoid of the fever of the soul ie being free from repentance without

acetasah who are devoid of discrimination nastan to have gone to ruin for what reason again do they not follow your teachings perform duties that are not theirs and not follow their own duties how is it that by remaining opposed to you they do not fear the evil which will arise from transgressing your commandments as to that the lord says143 333 even a man of wisdom behaves according to his own nature being follow their nature what can restraint do english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 333 api even jnanavan a man of wisdom what to speak of a fool cestate behaves sadrsam according to what svasyah his own prakrteh nature nature means the impressions of virtue vice etc also knowledge desires and so on acquired in the past lives and which become manifest at the commencement of the present life all creatures behave according to that only therefore bhutani beings yanti follow their prakrtim nature nigrahah kim karisyati what can restraint do be it from m e or anybody else if all beings behave only according to their own nature and there is none without his nature then since there arises the contingency of the scriptures becoming purposeless owing to the absence of any scope for personal effort therefo re the following is being stated144 334 attraction and repulsion are ordained with regard to the objects of all the organs one should not come under the sway of these two because they are his adversaries english translation of sri sankaracharyas s anskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 334 raga dvesau attraction and repulsion in the following manner attraction towards desirable things and repulsion against undesirable things vyavasthitau are ordained are sure to occur arthe with regar d to objects such as sound etc indriyasya indriyasya of all the organs with regard to each of the organs as to that the scope of personal effort and scriptural purpose are being stated as follows one who is engaged in the subject matter of the scrip tures should in the very beginning not come under the influence of love and hatred for that which is the nature of a person impels him to his actions verily under the influence eof love and hatred and then follow the rejection of ones own duty and t he undertaking of somebody elses duty on the other hand when a person controls love and hatred with the help of their opposites ignorance the cause of love and hatred has discrimination as its opposite then he145 becomes mindful only of the scriptura l teachings he ceases to be led by his nature therefore na agacchet one should not come vasam under the sway tayoh of these two of love and hatred hi because tau they are asya his this persons pari panthinau adversaries who like robbers put obstacles on his way to liberation this is the meaning in this world one impelled by love and hatred misinterprets even the teaching of the scriptures and thinks that somebody elses duty too has to be undertaken just because it is a duty that is wrong 335 ones own duty customary or scripturally ordained observances of different castes and sects tr though defective is superior to anothers duty well performed death is better while engaged in ones own duty anothers duty is fraught with fear english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 335 svadharmah ones own duty being practised even though vigunah defective deficient is sreyan superior to more commendable than para dharmat anothers duty though svanusthitat well performed meritoriously performed even146 nidhanam death is sreyah better while engaged svadharme in ones own duty as compared with remaining alive while engaged in somebody elses duty why paradharmah anothers duty is bhayavahah fraught with fear since it invites dangers such as hell etc although the root cause of evil was stated in in the case of a person who dwells on objects 262 and because they attraction and repulsion are his adversaries 34 that was presented desultorily and vaguely wishing to know it briefly and definitely as this is thus to be sure arjuna with the idea when this indeed becomes known i shall make effort for its eradication said 336 arjuna said now then o scion of the vrsni dynasty krsna impelled by what does this man commit sin even again st his wish being constrained by force as it were english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 336 atha now then varsneya o scion of the vrsni dynasty being prayuktah impelled kena by what acting as th e cause as a servant is by a king does ayam this purusah man carati commit papam147 sin a sinful act api even anicchan against his wish though not himself willing niyojitah being constrained balat by force iva as it were as if by a king which illustration has already been given the lord bhaga van said you hear about that enemy the source of all evil of which you ask bhaga is said to consist of all kinds of majesty virtue fame beauty detachment as well as liberation liberat ion stands for its cause illumination vp6574 that vasudeva in whom reside for ever unimpeded and in their fullness the six qualities of majesty etc and who has the knowledge of such subjects as creation etc is called bhaga van he is spok en of as bhaga van who is aware of creation and dissolution gain and loss gain and loss stand for future prosperity and adversity ignorance and illumination of all beings ibid 78 337 the blessed lord said this desire this anger born of t he quality of rajas is a great devourer a great sinner know this to be the enemy here english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda148 337 esah this kamah desire is the enemy of the whole world because of w hich the creatures incur all evil this desire when obstructed in any way turns into anger therefore krodhah anger is also identical with this desire it is rajoguna samudbhavah born of the quality of rajas or it is the origin of the quality of ra jas for when desire comes into being it instigates a person by arousing rajas people who are engaged in service etc which are effects of rajas and who are stricken with sorrow are heard to lament i have been led to act by desire indeed it is mah aasanah a great devourer whose food is enormous and hence indeed it is maha papma a great sinner for a being commits sin when goaded by desire therefore viddhi know enam this desire to be vairinam the enemy iha here in this world with the help of examples the lord explains how it is an enemy 338 as fire is enveloped by smoke as a mirror by dirt and as a foetus remains enclosed in the womb so in this shrouded by that english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda149 338 yatha as vahnih fire which is naturally bright avriyate is enveloped dhumena by smoke which is born concomitantly with fire and is naturally dark or as adarsah a mirror is covered malena by dirt ca and garbhah a foetus is avrtah enclosed ulbena in the womb by the amnion tatha so is idam this avrtam shrouded tena by that again what is that which is indicated by the word idam this and which is covered by desire the answer is 339 o son of ku nti knowledge is covered by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire which is an insatiable fire english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 339 jnanam knowledge is avrtam covered etena by this nityavairina constant enemy jnaninah of the wise for the wise person knows even earlier i am being induced by this into evil and he always both at the time when desire arises in him and also when he is forced to act by it feels distressed therefore it is the constant enemy of the wise but not of a fool for the fool looks upon desire as a friend so long as hankering lasts when sorrow150 comes as a consequence he realizes i have been driven into sorrow because of longings but certainly not earlier therefore it is the constant enemy of the wise alone in what form kama rupena in the form of desire tha which has wish itself as its expression is kama rupa in that form and duspurena which is an insatiable analena fire that which is difficult to satisfy is duspurah and derivatively that which never has enough alam is analam again having what as its abode does desire in the form of a viel over knowledge become the enemy of all since when the abode of an enemy is known it is possible to easily slay the enemy therefore the lord says 340 the organs mind and the intellect are said to be its abode this one diversely deludes the embodied being by veiling knowledge with the help of these english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 340 indriyani the organs manah mind and buddhih the intellect ucyate are said to be asya its desires adhisthanam abode esah this one desire vimohayati diversely deludes dehinam151 the embodied being avrtya by veiling jnanam knowledg etaih with the help of these with the organs etc which are its abodes the activities of the organs etc are the media for the expression of desire desire covers th e knoweldge of the self by stimulating these 341 therefore o scion of the bharata dynasty after first controlling the organs renounce this one a variant reading is prajahi hi enam completely renounce this one tr which is sinful and a destr oyer of learning and wisdom english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 341 since this is so therefore o scion of the bharata dynasty adau niyamya after first controlling indriyani the organs prajahihi renounce enam this one the enemy under consideration which is papmanam sinful which is desire that is accustomed to sinning and jnana vijnana nasanam a destroyer of learning and wisdom jnana learning means knowledge about the self etc from the scripures and a teacher vijnana wisdom means the full experience of that renounce ie discard from yourself the destroyer152 of those two learning and wisdom which are the means to the achievement liberation it has been said after first controlling the organs renounce desire the enemy as to that by taking the support of what should one give up desire this is being answered 342 they say that the organs are superior to the gross body the mind is superior to the organs but the intellect is superior to the mind however the one who is superior to the intellect is he english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 342 the learned ones ahuh say that indriyani the five five sense organs of visi on hearning taste smell and touch five motor organs hands feet speech and for excretion and generation these latter five are also understood in the present context organs ear etc are parani superior to the external gross and limited body fr om the point of view of subtlety inner position pervasiveness etc so also manah the mind having the nature of thinking and doubting sankalpa will volition intention thought reflection imangination etc vikalpadoubt uncertainly indecision suspicion153 error etc vsa is param superior indriyebhyah to the organs similarly buddhih the intellect having the nature of determination is para superior manasah to the mind and yah the one who is innermost as compared with all the obj ects of perception ending with the intellect and with regard to which dweller in the body it has been said that desire in association with its abodes counting from the organs deludes it by shrouding knowledge sah that one is tu however paratah superior buddheh to the intellect he the supreme self is the witness of the intellect the portion with regard to which dwellerthe supreme self is translated from ast which has the same reading here as the aa the g1 pr makes the abode c ounting from the organs an adjective of the dweller in the body and omits the portion is tu howeverbuddheh to the intellect tr 343 the ast introdcues this verse with tatah kim what follows from that tr understanding the self thu s understandingthusthat desires can be conquered through the knowledge of the self as superior to the intellect and completely establishing the self is spiritual absorption with the help of the mind o mighty armed one154 vanquish the enemy in th e form of desire which is difficult to subdue english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 343 buddhva understanding atmanam the self evam thus as param superior buddheh to the intellect and samsta bhya completely establishing atmana with the mind ie establishing the self fully in spiritual absorption with the help of your own purified mind o mighty armed one jahi vanquish this satrum enemy kama rupam in the form of desire which is du rasadam difficult to subdue which can be got hold of with great difficulty it being possessed of many inscrutable characteristics155 chapter 4 english translation swami gambhirananda 41 the blessed lord said i imparted this imperishable yoga to vivasvan vivasvan taught this to manu and manu transmitted this to iksavaku english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 41 in the beginning of creation with a veiw to infusing vigour into the ksatriyas who are the protectors of the world aham i proktavan imparted imam this avyayam imperishable yogam yoga presented in the preceding two chapters vivasvate to vivasvan the sun be ing endowed with this power of yoga they would be able to protect the brahmana caste the protection of the world becomes ensured when the brahmanas and the ksatriyas are protected it this yoga is avyayam imperishable because its result is undecaying for the result called liberation of this yoga which is characterized by steadfastness in perfect illumination does not decay and he156 vivasvan praha taught this manave to manu manu abravit transmitted this iksvakave to iksvaku his own s on who was the first king first king of the iksvaku dynasty otherwise known as the solar dynasty 42 the king sages knew this yoga which was received thus in regular succession that yoga o destroyer of foes in now lost owing to a long lapse of time english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 42 rajarsayah the king sages those who were kings and sages at the same time viduh knew imam this yoga which was evam parampara praptam received thus through a regular succession of ksatriyas sah that yogah yoga nastah is lost has go its traditional line snapped iha now mahata kalena owing to a long lapse of time parantapa o destroyer of foes by para are meant those against oneself he wh o like the sun scorches tapayati them by the rays of the heat of his prowess is parantapa ie scorcher of antagonists noticing that the yoga has got lost by reaching people who are weak and have no control157 of their organs and that the world h as become associated with goals that do not lead to liberation 43 that ancient yoga itself which is this has been taught to you by me today considering that you are my devotee and friend for this yoga is a profound secret english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 43 sah that puratanah ancient yogah yoga eva itself ayam which is this proktah has been taught te to you maya by me adya today iti considering that asi you are me my bhaktah devotee ca sakha and friend hi for etat this yoga ie knowledge is a uttamam profound rahasyam secret lest someone should understand that the lord has said something contradictory therefore in order to prevent that doubt as though raising a question 44 arjuna said your birth was later whereas the birth of vivasvan was earlier how am i to understand this that you instructed him in the beginning158 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 44 bhavatah your janma was aparam later in the abode of vasudeva whereas the birth vivasvatah of visvasvan the sun was param earlier in the beginning of cr eation therefore katham how vijanyam am i to understand etat this as not inconsistent iti that tvam you yourself who proktavan insturcted this yoga adau in the beginning are the same person who are now teaching me by way of demolishing t he doubt of fools with regard to vasudeva that he has no god hood and omniscience to which very purpose was arjunas question 45 the blessed lord said o arjuna many lives of mine have passed and so have yours i know them all but you know no t o scorcher of enemies english translation of sri

tvam you va vetta know not due to your power of understanding being obstructed by righteousness unrighteousness etc however parantapa o scorcher of foes aham i know possessing as i do unobstructed power of knowledge because by nature i am enternal pure enlightened and free in that case how in spite of the absence of righteousness and unrighteousness can there be any birth for you who are the eternal god that is beng answered 46 though i am birthless undecaying by nature and the lord of beings still by subjugating my prakriti i take birth by means of my own maya english translation of sri

and so also api san though isvarah the lord natural ruler bhutanam of beings from brahma to a clump of grass still adhisthaya by subjugating svam my own prakrtim prakrti the maya of visnu consisting of the three gunas under160 whose spell the whole world exists and deluded by which one does not know ones own self vasudeva by subjugating that prakrti of mine sambhavami i take birth appear to be come embodeid as though born atma mayaya by means of my own maya but not in reality like an ordinary man it is being stated when and why that birth occurs 47 o scion of the bharata dynasty whenever

followers of the virtuous path vinasaya for the destruction duskrtam of the evil doers of the sinful ones and also dharmasamsthapanarthaya for establishing virtue fully for that purpose sambhavami i manifest myself y uge yuge in every age 49 he who thus knows truly the divine birth and actions of mine does not get rebirth after casting off the body he attains me o arjuna english translation of

a form of maya ca karma and actions such as protection of the pious etc mama of mine na eti does not get punarjanma rebirth tyaktva after casting off this deham body sah he eti attains comes to mam me he gets liberated o arjuna162 this path of liberation has not been opened recently what then even in earlier days 410 many who w ere devoid of attachment fear and anger who were absorbed in me who had taken refuge in me and were purified by the austerity of knowledge have attained my state english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 410 bahavah many vita raga bhaya krodhah who were devoid of attachment fear and anger manmayah who were absorbed in me who were knowers of brahman who were seers of their identity with god mam upasrithah who had taken refuge only in me the s upreme god ie who were steadfast in knowledge alone and were putah purified who had become supremely sanctified jnana tapasa by the austerity of knowledge knowledge itself about the supreme reality being the austerity becoming sanctified by that austerity of knowledge agatah have attained madbhavam my state goodhood liberation the particular mention of the austerity of knowledge is to indicate that steadfastness in knowledge does not depend on any other163 austerity in that case you hav e love and aversion because of which you grant the state of identity with yourself only to a few but not to others the answer is 411 according to the manner in which they approach me i favour them in that very manner o son of partha human beings follow my path in every way english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 411 yatha according to the manner in which the purpose for which seeking whatever fruit prapadyante they approach mam me aham i bhajami favour tan them tatha eva in that very manner by granting that fruit this is the idea for they are not seekers of liberation it is certainly impossible for the same person to be a seeker of liberation and at the same time a seeker of rewards of actions therefore by granting fruits to those who hanker after fruits by granting knowledge to those who follow what has been stated in the scriptures and are seekers of liberation but do not hanker after rewards and by granting liberat ion to those who are men of164 wisdom and are monks aspiring for liberation and so also by removing the miseries of those who suffer in these ways i favour them just according to the manner in which they approach me this is the meaning on the other hand i do not favour anybody out of love or aversion or out of delusion under all circumstances o son of prtha manusyah human beings anuvartante follow sarvasah in every way mama my vartma path the paths characterized by knowledge and by action rites and duties the path of god who am omnipresent by human beings are meant those people who become engaged in their respective duties to which they are qualified according to the results they seek if your wish to be favourable is the same towar ds all creatures on account of the absence of the defects of love and aversion in you who are god and you are there with your capacity to grant all rewards why then do not all becoming desirous of liberation take refuge in you alone with the very knowl edge that vasudeva is everything as to that hear the reason for this 412 longing for the fruition of actions of their rites and duties they worship the gods here for in the human world success from action comes quickly165 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 412 kanksantah longing for praying for siddim fruition fructification of the results karmanam of actions yajante they worship iha here in this world devatah the gods indra fire and others which accords with the upanisadic text while he who worships another god thinking he is one and i am another does not know he is like an animal to the gods br 1410 this text points out that the reason for adoring other det ies is the ignorance of the self which gives rise to the ideas of difference between the worshipped and the worshipper as animals are beneficial to human beings so also is the sacrificer to the gods because through oblations he works for their pleasure hi for in the case of those indeed who sacrifice to other gods and long for results siddhih success karmaja from action bhavati comes ksiparm quickly manuse loke in the human world because the authority of the scriptures extends only ov er the human world by the specific statement for in the human world success comes quickly the lord shows that results of actions can accrue even in the other worlds the difference lies166 in this that in the human world eligibility for ast and aa omit adhikara elegibility for and read karmani tr actions is according to castes stages of life etc the fruition of the results of those actions of persons who are eligible according to castes stages of life etc comes quickly what is the reason for the rule that the competence for rites and duties according to castes stages of life etc obtains only in the human world but not in the other worlds or it has been said human beings having such divisions as castes stages of life etc follow my path in every way for what reason again do they as a rule follow your path alone but not of others this is being answered 413 the four castes have been created by me through a classification of the gunas and duties even though i am the agent of that act of classification still know me to be a non agent and changeless english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 413 catur varnyam meaning the same as catvarah varnah the four castes srstam have been created maya by me who am god which accords with167 such vedic texts as the brahmanas were his face rg 109012 guna karma vibhagasah through a classifica tion of the gunas and duties ag writes guna vibhagena karma vibhagah classification of the duties determined by the classification of the gunas tr by the gunas are meant sattva rajas and tamas see note under 245 also see chapter 14 as to tha t the control of the mind and body austerity etc are the duties of the brahmanas who are sattvika ie have a predominance of the quality of sattva purity goodness etc courage valour etc are the duties of the ksatriyas in whom sattva become s secondary and rajas passion attachment etc preponderates agriculture etc are the duties of the vaisya in whom tamas indolence ignorance etc is secondary and rajas is predominant service is the only duty of the sudra in whom rajas is second ary and tamas predominates see chapters 14 1617 and 18 in this way the four castes have been created by me through a classification of the gunas and duties this is the idea and these four castes do not prevail in the other worlds hence the specifi cation in the human world well in that caste by virtues of your being he agent of the acts of creation of the four castesetc you become subject tothe consequence of those actions168 therefore you are not eternally free and the eternal lord this is being answered api even though i am kartaram the agent tasya of that act from the empirical standpoint of maya still from the highest standpoint viddhi know mam me to be akartaram a non agent and therefore also know me to be avyayam chan geless not subject to the cycle of births and deaths in reality however i am not the agent of those actions of which you think i am the agent because 414 actions do not taint me for me there is no hankering for the results of actions one w ho knows me thus does not become bound by actions english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 414 because of the absence of egoism those karmani actions na limpanti do not taint mam me by becoming the originators of body etc and me for me na sprha there is no hankering for the results of those actions but in the case of transmigrating beings who have self identification in the form i am the agent and thirst for actions as also for their result s it is reasonable that actions169 should taint them owing to the absence of these actions do not taint me anyone else too yah who abhijanati knows mam me iti thus as his own self and knows i am not an agent i have no hankering for the res ults of actions sah he na badhyate does not become bound karmabhih by actions in his case also actions cease to be the originators of body etc this is the import 415 having known thus duties were performed even by the ancient seekers of lib eration thererfore you undertake action itself as was performed earlier by the ancient ones english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 415 jnatva having known evam thus that i am not an agent i have no desire for the results of actions karma duties krtam were undertaken api even purvaih by the ancient mumuksubhih seekers of liberation tasmat therefore tvam you kuru undertake karma action eva itself you ought not to sit quietly or even renounce therefore you undertake actions because they were performed by the ancients as well if you have no self knowledge then undertake actions for170 selfpurification or if you have self knowledge then undertake actions in order to preven t people from going astray as were krtam performed purvataram earlier purvaih by the ancient ones janaka and others not actions as are undertaken in the present day this last portion of the sentence is translated by some as follows you should n ot undertake actions which are done in the present manner ie do not perform actions in the manner undertakne by people nowadays which neither purifies the mind nor helps people see g1 pr p 114 if action has to be undertaken here then i shall do so following your instruction itself what is the use of specifying that it was done earlier by the ancient ones the answer is because there is a great difficult as regards actions how 416 even the intelligent are confounded as to what is ac tion and what is inaction i shall tell you of that action by knowing which you will become free from evil english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 416 kavayah api even the intelligent mohitah are confou nded in this subject of action etc iti atra as171 to kim karma what is action and kim akarma what is inaction therefore pravaksyami i shall tell te you of karma action akarma ca as also of inaction jnatva by knowing yat which action etc moksyase you will become free asubhat from evil from transmigration and you should not think thus what is called karma is the movement of the body etc as are well known in the world and akarma inaction is not doing those ie sitting quietly what is there to understand further in that regard why the answer is 417 for there is something to be known even about action and something to be known about prohibited action and something has to be known about inaction the true nature of action is inscrutable english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 417 hi for there is something boddhavyam to be known api even karmanah about action enjoined by the scriptures and there is certainly something to be known vikarmanah about prohibited action so also there is something to be known akarmanah about inaction about sitting quietly172 the words there is are to be supplied in all the three cases because gatih the true nature ie the essential nature karmanah of action implying karma etc viz action prohibited action and inaction is gahana inscrutable hard to understand what again is the essential nature of action etc which has to be understood and about which it was prom ised i shall tell you 16 this is being stated 418 he who finds inaction in action and action in inaction he is the wise one possessed of the knowledge of brahman among men he is engaged in yoga and is a performer of all actions english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 418 since engagement and non engagement in action depend on an agent therefore yah he who pasyet ie pasyati finds akarma inaction absence of action karmani in action karma means whatever is done action in general in tha action and yah who finds karma action akarmani in inaction in the absence of action sah he is buddhiman a wise one manusyesu among men all dealings involving an act accesso ries etc exist173 certainly on the plane of ignorance both engagement and non engagement presuppose agentship and an act of some kind this however holds good on the plane of ignorance but not on that of self realization only so long as one has not attained to the reality he is a yogi yuktah engaged in yoga and a krtsna karma krt performer of all actions one who discriminates between action and actions one who discriminates between action and inaction is praised thus objection well what is m eant by this contradictory statement he who finds inaction in action and action in inaction for action cannot become inaction nor inaction action that being so how can a witness have such an incongruous perception vedantin is it not that ast reads na in place of nanu tr to an ordinary foolsih observer that which is reality is inaction appears as action and similarly action itself as inaction that being so in order to show things as they are the lord says he who finds inaction in ac tion etc therefore there is no incongruity besides the qualifications such as intelligent etc thus become logical and by saying there is something to be known is implied the perception of things as they are moreover freedom from evil canno t follow from an erroneous perception whereas it174 has been said by knowing which you will become free from evil therefore one account of action and inaction being perceived contrarily by the creatures the lords utterance he who finds inaction in a ction etc is for dispelling their contrary perception not that in the empirical plane inaction has action as its receptacle like a plum in a bowl nor even has action inaction as its receptacle because inaction is a negation of action therefore act ion and inaction are actually perceived contrarily by the ordinary persons like seeing water in a mirage or silver in nacre objection is it not that to every one action is action itself never is there an exception to this vedantin that is not so bec uase when a boat is moving motionless trees on the bank appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on the boat an absence of motion is noticed in distant moving things which are not near ones eyes similarly here also occurs the contrary percept ions viz seeing action in inaction under the idea i am doing ast omits aham karomi iti under the idea i am doing tr and seeing inaction in acion because of which it is said he who finds inaction in action etc in order to eliminate th em as such although this answer has been given more than once still a man becomes repeatedly deluded under the influence of175 a totally opposite perception and forgetting the truth that has been heard again and again he repeatedly raises false issues an d questions and therefore observing that the subject is difficult to understand the lord gives his answer again and again the absence of action in the self well known from the vedas smrtis and logic as stated in it is said that this is unmanifest this is inconceivable 225 never is this one born and never does it die 220 ka 1218 etc has been and will be spoken of the contrary perception of action in that actionless self ie in inaction is very deep rooted owing to which even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction and as a consequence of the superimposition of aciton pertaining to the body etc on the self there arises such ideas as i am an agent this is my action its result is to be en joyed by me similarly with the idea i shall remain quiet whereby i shall be free from exertion free from activity and happy and superimposing on the self the cessation of activities pertaining to the body and organs and the resulting happiness a man imagines i shall not do anything i shall sit quietly and happily that being so the lord says he who finds inaction in action etc with a view to removing this contrary understanding of man and176 here in this world though action belonging to the body and organs continues to be action still it is superimposed by everyone on the acitonless unchanging self as a result of which even a learned person things i act therefore in action karmani which is universally considered by all people t o be inherent in the self like the perception of motion in the stationary trees on the bank of a river in that action he who contrariwise finds the fact of inaction like perceiving absence of motion in those trees and in inaction akarmani in the cessation of the activities pertaining to the body and organs and ascribed to the self in the same way that actions are ascribed in that action he who sees action because of egoism being implicit in the idea i am happily seated quietly without doing anything he who knows thus the distinction between action and inaction is wise is learned among men he is engaged in yoga he is a yogi and a performer of all actions and he freed from evil attains fulfilment this is the meaning this verse is interpreted by some in another way how thus since the daily obligatory duties nityakarmas certainly have no results when performed as a dedication to god therefore in a secondary sense they are said to be inaction again the non performance of these nitya177 karmas is inaction since this produces an evil result therefore it is called action verily in a figurative sense that being so he who sees inaction in the daily obligatory duties nitya karmas owing to the obsence of their results in th e same way as a cow that does not yield milk is said to be not a cow though in reality it is so so also in the non performance of the daily obligatory duties ie in inaction he who sees action since that yields results such as hell etc this explan ation is not logical because freedom from evil as a result of such knowledge is unreasonable and the utterance of the lord in the sentence by knowing which you will become freed from evil will be contradicted how even if it be that liberation from evil follows from the performance of nitya karmas it cannot however follow from the knowledge of the absence of their results for it has not been enjoined anywhere that knowledge of the nityakarmas themselves leads to the result of freedom from evil nor has this been stated here by the lord himself hereby is refuted the seeing of action in inaction as explained by others tr for according to the opponent seeing of action in inaction has not been enjoined here here in the present ve rse as a duty but what has been enjoined is merely that performance of the178 nityakarmas is obligatory moreover no result can accrue from the knowledge that evil arises from nonperformance of nityakramas nor even has nonperformance of nityakarmas been enjoined as something that should be known besides such results as freedom from evil wisdom engagement in yoga and being a performer of all actions cannot reasonably follow from a false perception of action as inaction nor is this a eulogy of fa lse perception the stated results accrue from correct knowledge not from false perception and correct knowledge alone is praise worthy indeed false perception is itself an abvious form of evil how can it bring about liberation from another evil su rely darkness does not become the remover of darkness opponent well the seeing of inaction in action or the seeing of action in inaction that is not a false perception vadantin what then opponent it is a figurative statement based on the existence or the non existence of results vedantin not so because there is no such scriptural statement that something results from knowing action as inaction and inaction as action even in a figurative sense besides nothing particular is gained by rejecting what is heard of in the scriptures and imagining something that is not further it was possible for the lord to express in179 his own words that there is no result from the nityakarmas and that by their non performance one would have to go to hell unde r such circumstances what was the need of the ambiguous statement he who sees inaction in action etc which is misleading to others this being the case such an explanation by anyone will be clearly tantamount to imagining that statement of the lord as meant for deluding people moreover this subject matter performance of nityakarmas is not something to be protected with mystifying words it is not even logical to say that the subject matter will become easy for comprehension if it is stated again and again through different words for the subject matter that was stated more clearly in your right is for action alone 247 does not need any repetition and everwhere it is said that whatever is good and ought to be practised deserves to be unde rstood anything purposeloss does not deserve to be known besides neither is false knowledge worth acquiring nor is the semblance of an object presented by it worth knowing nor even can any evil which is an entity arise from the non performance of nit yakarmas which is a non entity for there is the statement of the unreal there is no being 216 and in the upanisad it has been180 pointed out how can existence originate from nonexistence ch 422 since emergence of the existent from the non existent has been denied therefore anyones assertion that the existent originates from the nonexistent will amount to saying that a non entity becomes an entity and an entity becomes a non entity and that is not rational because it runs counter to all the means of valid knowledge further the scriptures cannot enjoin fruitless actions they being naturally painful and it is illogical that what is painful should be done intentionally also if it is admitted that falling into hell results from their no n performance ie of the nityakarmas then that too is surely a source of evil in either case whether one undertakes them or not the scriptures will be imagined to be useless and there will be a contradiction with your own standpoint when after hol ding that the nityakarmas are fruitless you assert that they lead to liberation therefore the meaning of he who finds inaction in action etc is just what stands out literally and the verse has been explained by us accordingly the aforesaid percept ion of inaction in action etc is being praised181 419 the wise call him learned whose actions are all devoid of desires and their thougts kama sankalpa is variously translated as desires and purposes plans and desires for results hankering for desires etc but sankarcarya shows sankalpa as the cause of kama tr and whose actions have been burnt away by the fire of wisdom english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 419 budhah the wise the knowers of brahman ahuh call tam him panditam learned in the real sense yasya whose of the one who perceives as stated above samarambhah actions whatever are undertaken are sarve all kama sankalpa varjitah devoid of desires and the thoughts which are their desires causes see 262 ie those actions are performed as mere movements without any selfish purpose if they are performed by one already engaged in actions then they are for preventing people from going astray and if they are done by one who has withdrawn from actions then they are merely for the maintenance of the body and jnanagni dagdha karmanam whose actions have been burnt away by the fire of wisdom finding182 inaction etc in action etc is jnana wisdom that itself is agnih fire he whose actions karma described as good and bad have been dagdhani burnt away by that fire of wisdom is jnana agni dagdha karma however one who is a perceiver of inaction etc perceiver of inaction etc he who knows the truth about action and inaction as explained before tr is free from actions owing to the very fact of his seeing inaction etc he is a monk who acts merely for the purpose of maintaining the body being so he does not engage in actions although he might h ave done so before the dawn of discrimination he again who having been engaged in actions under the influence of past tendencies later on becomes endowed with the fullest self knowledge he surely renounces all ast adds this word sarva all tr ac tions along with their accessories as he does nnot find any purpose in activity for some reason if it becomes impossible to renounce actions and he for the sake of preventing people from going astray even remains engaged as before in actions without attachment to those actions and their results because of the absence of any selfish purpose still he surely does nothing at all his actions verily become inaction because of having been burnt183 away by the fire of wisdom by way of pointing out this idea the lord says 420 having given up attachment to the results of action he who is ever contented dependent on nothing he really does not do anything even though engaged in action english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 420 with the help of the above mentioned wisdom tyaktva having given up the idea of agentship and phala asangam attachment to the results of action he who is nitya trptah ever trptah ever contented ie has no hankering for objects and nirasrayah dependent on nothing asraya means that on which a person leans desiring to achieve some human goal the idea is that he is dependent of any support which may be a means of attaining some coveted seen or unseen result in reality a ctions done by a man of knowledge are certainly inactions since he is endowed with the realization of the actionless self actions together with their accessories must be relinquished by one who has become thus because they have no end to serve this bei ng so api even184 though he remains abhi pravrttah engaged as before karmani in actions getting out of those actions being impossible either with the intention of preventing people from going astray or with a view to avoiding the censure of the wise people sah he eva really na karoti does not do kincit anything because he is endued with the realization of the actionless self from the subjective standpoint of the enlightened there are no actions but ordinary people mistakenly think them to be actions which in reality are a mere semblance of it on the other hand one who is the opposite of the above mentioned one and in whom even before undertaking works has dawned the realization of his identity with brahman the all pervasive inmo st actionless self whobeing bereft of solicitation for desirable objects seen or unseen has renounced actions along with their accessories by virtue of seeing no purpose to be served by undertaking actions meant to secure some seen or unseen result a nd makes effort only for the maintenance of the body he the monk steadfast in knowledge becomes free hence in order to express this idea the lord says 421 one who is without solicitation who has the mind and organs under control and is total ly185 without possessions he incurs no sin by performing actions merely for the maintenance of the body english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 421 nirasih one who is without solicitation one from whom as isah asih is a kind of desire that can be classed under prayer some translate it as desire hope tr solicitations have departed yata citta atma who has the mind and organs under control one by whom have been controlled yatau both the internal organ citta and the external aggregate of body and organs atma and is tyakta sarva parigrahah parigraha receiving accepting possessions belongings vsa totally without possessions one by whom have been renounced tyaktah all sarvah possessions parigrahah na apnoti he does not incur kilbisam sin in the form of evil as also rigtheousness to one aspiring for liberation even righteousness is surely an evil because it brings bondage here ast adds tasmat tabhyam mukto bhavati sams arat mukto bhavati ityarthah therefore he becomes free from both of them ie he becomes liberated from transmigration tr186 kurvan by performing karma actions kevalam merely sariram for the purpose of maintaining the body without the idea of age nship even with regard to these actions further in the expression kevalam sariram karma do the words sariram karma mean actions done by the body or actions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body again what does it matter if by the wor ds sariram karma is meant actions done by the body or actions merely for the purpose of maintaning the body the answer is if by sariram karma is meant actions done by the body then it will amount to a contradiction contradiction of the scriptures when the lord says one does not incur sin by doing with his body any action meant for seen or unseen purposes even though it be prohibited even if the lord were to say that one does not incur sin by doing with his body some scripturally sanctioned a ction intended to secure a seen or an unseen end then there arises the contingency of his denying something some evil that has not come into being further from the specification sariram karma kurvan by doing actions with the body and from the u se of the word kevala only it will amount to saying that one incurs sin by performing actions called righteous and unrighteous which can be187 accomplished with the mind and speech and which come within the purview of injunction and prohibition even the re the statement that one incurs sin by performing enjoined actions through the mind and speech will involve a contradiction even in the case of doing what is prohibited it will amount to a mere purposeless restatement of a known fact on the other hand when the sense conveyed by sariram karma is taken as acctions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body then the implication will be that he does not do any other work as can be accomplished physically orally or mentally which are known from injunctions and prohibitions of the scriptures and which have in view seen or unseen results while he appears to people to be working with those very body speech etc merely for the purpose of maintaining the body yet he does not incur sin by merely mak ing movements of the body etc because from the use of the word kevala merely it follows that he is devoid of the sense of agentship implicit in the idea i do since there is no possibility of a person who has reached such a state incurring evil as suggest by the word sin therefore he does not become subject to the evil of transmigration that is to say he certainly becomes free without any obstacle since he has all his188 actions burnt away by the fire of wisdom this verse is only a reiteration of t he result of full illumination stated earlier it becomes faultless by accepting the interpretation of sariram karma thus in the case of the monk who has renounced all possessions since owning food etc meant for the bare sustenance of the body is absent therefore it becomes imperative to beg for alms etc for the upkeep of the body under this circumstance by way of pointing out the means of obtaining food etc for the maintenance of the body of a monk as permitted by the text what comes unasked for without forethought and spontaneously unasked for what comes before the monk gets ready for going out for alms without forethought alms that are not given with abuses and have not fallen on the ground but collected from five or seven houses with out any plan spontaneously alms brought to one spontaneously by devoted people bo sm 21 8 12 etc the lord says 422 remaining satisfied with what comes unasked for having transcended the dualities being free from spite and equipoised un der success and failure he is not bound even by performing actions189 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 422 yadrccha labha santustah remaining satisfied with what comes unasked for yadrccha labha mean s coming to possess something without having prayed for it feeling contented with that dvandva atitahhaving transcended the dualities one is said to be beyond dualities when his mind is not distressed even when afflicted by such opposites as heat and c old etc vimatsarah being free from spite from the idea of enmity and samah equipoised siddhau ca asiddhau is success and failure with regard to things that come unasked for the monk who is such who is equipoised not delighted or sorrowful in getting or not getting food etc for the sustenance of the body who sees inaction etc in action etc who is ever poised in the realization of the self as it is who with regard to the activities accomplished by the body etc in the course of going abo ut for alms etc for the bare maintenance of the body is ever clearly conscious of the fact i certainly do not anything the organs act on the objects of the organs see 58 328 he realizing the absence of agentship in the self certainly does not do any actions like going about for alms etc but when190 abserving similarly with common human behaviour agentship is attributed to him by ordinary poeple then he apparently becomes an agent with regard to such actions as moving about for alms etc how ever from the standpoint of his own realization which has arisen from the valid means of knowledge presented in the scriptures he is surely not an agent he to whom is thus ascribed agentship by others na nibadhyate is not bound api even krtva by performing such actions as moving about for alms merely for the maintenance of the body because action which is a source of bondage has been burnt away along with its cause by the fire of wisdom thus this is only a restatement of what has been said eari lier when a person who has already started works becomes endowed with the realization of the identity of the self with the actionless brahman then it follows that in the case of that man who has experienced the absence of agentship actions and purposes in the self actions become relinquished but if this becomes impossible for some reason and he continues to be engaged in those acitons as before still he certainly does not do anything this absence of action has been shown in the verse having given up attachment to the results of191 action 20 of that very person with regard to whom has been shown the absence of aciton 423 of the liberated person who has got rid of attachment whose mind is fixed in knowledge actions undertaken for a sacrifice get totally destroyed english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 423 muktasya of the liberated person who has become relieved of such bondages as righteousness and unrighteousness etc gatasangasya who has got rid of attachment who has become detached from everything jnana avasthita cetasah whose mind is fixed in knowledge onl y his karma actions acaratah undertaken yajnaya for a sacrifice to accomplish a sacrifice ag takes yajna to mean visnu so yajnaya will mean for visnu sankaracarya also interprets this word similarly in 39tr praviliyate gets destroyed samagram totally saha together agrena with its consequence result this is the meaning for what reason again does an action that is underway get destroyed totally without producing its result this is being answered because192 424 the ladle i s brahman some translate as brahman is the ladle etc tr the oblations is brahman the offering is poured by brahman in the fire of brahman brahman alone is to be reached by him who has concentration on brahman as the objective as an object to be known and attained some translate brahma karma samadhina as by him who sees brahman in action english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 424 brahma arpanam the ladle is brahman the knower of brahma n perceives the instrument with which he offers oblation in the fire as brahman itself he perceives it as not existing separately from the self as one sees the non existence of silver in nacre in this sense it is that brahman itself is the ladle just as what appears as silver is only narcre the two words brahma and arpanam are not parts of a compound word samasa the meaning is that to a knower of brahman what is perceived in the world as ladle is brahman itself similarly brahma havih the oblati ons is brahman to him what is seen as oblations is nothing but brahman in the same way brahma agnau this is193 a compound word in the fire of brahman the fire into which oblation is hutam poured brahmana by brahman by the agent is brahman itsel f the meaning is that brahman itself is the agent of the offering that he makes the offering the act of offering that is also brahman and the result that is gantavyam to be reached by him that also is brahma eva surely brahman brahma karma samad hina by him who has concentration on brahman as the objective brahman itself is the objective karma he who has concentration samadhi on that is brahma karma samdhih the goal to be reached by him is brahman alone thus even the action undertaken by one who desires to prevent mankind from going astray is in reality inaction for it has been sublated by the realization of brahman this being so in the case of the monk from whom aciton has dropped off who has renounced all activity viewing his knowl edge as a kind of sacrifice too becomes all the more justifiable from the point of view of praising full realization that is whatever is well known as ladle etc in the context of a sacrifice all that in the context of the self is brahman itself t o one who has realized the supreme truth if not so then since all in brahman it would have been uselesss to specifically mention ladle etc as brahman194 therefore all actions cease to exist for the man of realization who knows that brahman itself is al l this and this follows also from the absence in him of the idea of accessories see note on p211 tr for the act called sacarifice is not seen to exist without being in association with the idea of accessories all such acts as agnihotra etc are associated with the ideas of such accessories as making an offering etc to the particular gods who are revealed in the scriptures and with the idea of agentship as also desire for results but they are not found bereft of the ideas of such distinctions as exist among action accessories and results or unassociated with the ideas of agentship hankering for results this apparent activity of the man of knowledge however stands dissociated from the ideas of differences among the accessories like ladle etc actions and results which get destroyed by the knowledge of brahman hence it is inaction to be sure and thus has it been shown in he who finds inaction in action 18 he really does not do anything even though engaged in action 20 the organs act on the objects of the organs 328 remaining absorbed in the self the knower of reality should think i certainly do not do anything 58 etc while pointing out thus the lord demolishes in various places the ideas of195 differences amo ng actions accessories and results and it is also seen in the case of rites such as agnihotra undertaken for results kamya that the agnihotra etc cease to be kamya rites undertaken for selfish motives when the desire for their results is destroyed similarly it is seen that actions done intentionally and unintentionally yeild different results so here as well in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle etc actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of brahman even activites which are merely external movements amount to inaction hence it was said gets totally destroyed here some say that which is brahman is the ladle etc it is surely brahman itself which exists in the five forms asscessories th at can be indicated by the five grammatical case ending viz nominative objective instrumental dative and locative as for instance the sacrificer oblation ladle sacrificial fire and brahman tr of accessories such as the ladle etc and it is it self which undertakes actions there the ideas of ladle etc are not eradicated but the idea of brahman is attributed to the ladle etc as one does the ideas of visnu etc to images etc or as one does the idea of brahman ot name etc reply true this c ould have been so as well if the context were not meant for196 the praise of jnanayajna knowledge considered as a sacrifice here however after presenting full realization as expressed by the word jnana yajna and the varieties of rites as referred to by the word yajna sacrifice knowledge has been praised by the lord in jnana yajna knowledge considered as a sacrifice is greater than sacrifices requiring materials 33 and in the present context this statement the ladle is brahman etc is capa ble of presenting knowledge as a sacrifice otherwise since brahman is everything it will be purposeless to speak specially only of ladle etc as brahman but those who maintain that one has to superimpose the idea of brahman on the ladle etc like supe rimposing the idea of visnu and others on images etc and of brahman on name etc for them the knowledge of brahma stated in the verse cannot be the intended subject matter dealt with here because according to them ladle etc are the primary objects of knowledge in the context of the present verse besides knowledge in the form of superimposition of an idea cannot lead to liberation as its result and what is said here is brahman alone in to be realized by him also it is inconsistent to mainta in that the result of liberation can be achieved without full realization and it goes against the context the context being of197 full realization this is supported by the fact that the subject of full realization is introduced in the verse he who find s inaction in action and at the end of this chapter the conclusion pertains to that very subject matter the chapter comes to a close by eulozing full realization itself in jnana yajna knowledge considered as a sacrifice is greater than sacrifices requiring materials achieving knowledge oneattains supreme peace 39 etc that being so it is unjustifiable to suddenly say out of context that one has to superimpose the idea of brahman on the ladle etc like the superimposition of the idea of visnu on images therefore this verse bears the meaing just as it has been already explained as to that after having presented knowledge as a sacrifice other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in the verses beginning with other yogis undertake sacrifice to gods alone etc for eulogizing that knowledge 425 other yogis undertake sacrifice to gods alone others offer the self as a sacrifice by the self itself in the fire of brahman english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda198 425 apare other yoginah yogis ritualists pari upasate undertake yajnam sacrifice daivam to gods eva alone a sacrifice by which the gods are adored is daiva yajna they perform only that this is the meaning brahma agnau in the fire of brahman by the word brahman is meant that which is referred to in such sentences as brahman is truth knowledge and infinite tai 21 knowledge bliss brahman br 3928 the brahman that is immediate and direct the self that is within all br341 which is devoid of all worldly characteristiscs like hunger etc and which is beyond all particular qualifications as stated in not this not this br4422 that which is brahman is the fire brahman is called fire because as reflected in wisdom it burns away everything ie ignorance or because everything merges into it during dissolution pralaya and it is spoken of as brahmagni with a view to referring to it as that into which the offering is made in that fire of brahman apare others other knowers of brahman upa juhvati offer yajnam the self which is referred to by the word yajna sacrifice it having been presented as a synonym of the self that self which is a sacrifice which is reality is verily the supreme brahman which is associated with such limiting adjuncts as the intellect etc199 which is associated with all the qualities of the limiting adjuncts superimposed on it and which is the oblation they offer yajnena by the self itse lf as described above the offering of the self in that brahman is nothing but the realization of that self which is assoicated with the limiting adjuncts to be the supreme brahman which is free from adjuncts the monks steadfast in the realization of the identity of brahman and the self make that offering this is the meaning beginning with the ladle is brahman etc this sacrifice characterized as full realization is being included among such sacrifices as daiva yajna etc with a view to eulogiz ing it in the verses beginning with o destroyer of enemies jnana yajna is greater than the sacrifices involving sacrificial materials 426 others offer the organs viz ear etc in the fires of self control others offer the objects viz sound etc in the fires of the organs english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 426 anye others other yogis juhvati offer indriyani the organs viz srotradini car etc samyama agnisu in the fires of self control the200 plural in fires is used because self control is possible in respect of each of the organs self control itself is the fire in that they make the offering ie they practise control of the organs anye others juhvati offer visayan the objects sabdadin viz sound etc indriyagnisu in the fires of the organs the organs themselves are the fires they make offerings in those fires with the organs of hearing etc they consider the perception of objects not prohibited by the scriputures t o be a sacrifice 427 others offer all the activities of the organs and the activities of the vital force into the fire of the yoga of sel control which has been lighted by knowledge english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 427 further apare others juhvati offer ie merge sarvani all indriya karmani the activities of the organs and also the prana karmani activities of the vital force prana means the air in the body they offer its activities such as contraction expansion etc atma samyama yoga agnau into the fire of the yoga of self control201 withdrawal samyama samyama consists of concentration meditation and self absorption the idea conveyed by the verse is that by stopping all activities they concentrate the mind on the self into the self atma is self control atma samyama that itself is the fire of yoga yoga agni they offer into that fire jnana dipite which has been lighted by knowledge made to blaze up by discriminating knowledge as if lighted up by oil 428 similarly others are performers of sacrifices through wealth through austerity through yoga and through study and knowledge others are ascetics with severe vows english translation of sri sa nkaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 428 tatha similarly apare others are dravya yajnah perfomers of sacrifices through wealth those sacrificers who spend wealth dravya in holy places under the idea of performing sacrifices tapoyajnah performers of sacrifices through austerity men of austerity to whom austerity is a sacrifice this is according to ast tr yogayajnah performers of sacrifice through yoga those to whom the yoga consisting in the control of the vital202 forces withdrawal of the organs etc is a sacrifice and svadhyaya jnana yajnah performers of sacrifices through study and knowledge sacrificers through study are those to whom the study of rg veda etc accroding to rules is a sacrifice and sacrificers thr ough knowledge are those to whom proper understanding of the meaing of the scriptures is a sacrifice others are yatayah ascetics who are deligent samsita vratah in following severe vows those whose vows vratah have been fully sharpened samsita m ade very rigid are samsita vratah six kinds of sacrifices have been enumerated in this verse further 429 constantly practising control of the vital forces by stopping the movements of the outgoing and the incoming breaths some offer as a sacrif ice the outgoing breath in the incoming breath while still others the incoming breath in the outgoing breath english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 429 pranayama parayanah constantly practising control of the vital forces ie they practise a form of pranayama called kumbhaka stopping the breath203 either inside or outside three sorts of motion of pranayama control of the vital forces are one by which we draw the breath in another by which we throw it out and the third action is when the breath is held in the lungs or stopped from entering the lungs cw voli 1962 p 267 thus there are two kinds of kumbhaka internal and external prana apana gati ruddhva by stopping the movements of the outgoing and the incoming breaths the outgoing of breath exhalation through the mouth and the nostrils is the movement of the prana as opposed to that the movement of apana is the going down of breath inhalation these constitute the prana apana gati movements of prana and apana by stopping these some juhvati offer as a sacrifice pranam the outgoing breath which is the function of prana apane in the incoming breath which is the function of apana ie they practised a form of pranayama cal led puraka filling in while tatha apare still others offer apanam the incoming breath prane in the outgoing breath ie they practise a form of pranayama called recaka emptying out constantly practising control of the vital forces they p erform kumbhaka after recaka and puraka204 430 others having their food regulated offer the vital forces in the vital forces all of them are knowers of the sacrifice and have their sins destroyed by sacrifice english translation of sri sankara charyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 430 besides apare others niyata aharah having their food regulated juhvati offer pranan the vital forces the different kinds of vital forces pranesu in the vital forces themselves whichever function of the vital forces is brought under control in it they offer the other functions these latter become as it were merged in the former sarve api all of ete them yajna vidah are knowers of the sacrifice and yajna ksapita kamasah have the ir sins destroyed by the sacrifices as mentioned above after accomplishing the above mentioned sacrifices 431 those who partake of the nectar left over after a sacrifice reach the eternal brahman this world ceases to exist for one who does not perf orm205 sacrifices what to speak of the other world o best among the kurus arjuna english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 431 yajna sista amrta bhujah those who partake of the nectar left over after a s acrifice ie those who after performing the sacrifices described above eat during the leisure after the sacrifice the food called nectar as prescribed by the injunctions yanti reach sanatanam brahma the eternal brahman for the sake of consisten cy with the upanisads it is understood that if they the sacrificers are seekers of liberation then they reach brahman in due course of time the upanisads describe the different stages through which those who do good deeds and practise meditation h ave to pass before reaching the qualified brahman after death for liberation there is need also of purification of the heart thus they reach brahman by stages and not immediately after death see ch 85 and subsequent portion also br 4335 to 44 25 etc even ayam lokah this world common to all beings na asti ceases to exist ayajnasya for one who does not perform sacrifices for him who does not have to his credit206 even a single one of the above sacrifices kutah anyah what to speak of th e other world which can be achieved through special disciplines kurusattama o best among the kurus 432 thus various kinds of sacrifices lie spread at the mouth of the vedas know them all to be born of action knowing thus you will become liberated english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 432 evam th us bahu vidha yajnah various kinds of sacrifices as described vitatah lie spread mukhe at the mouth at the door brahmanah of the vedas those which are known through the vedas as for instance we offer the vital force into speech etc are said to be vitatah spread elaborated mukhe at the mouth brahmanah of the vedas viddhi know tan them sarvan all to be karmajan born of action accoplished through the activities of body speech and mind but not born of the self for the self is a ctionless hence jnatva knowing evam thus vimoksyase you will become liberated from evil by knowing thus these are not my actions i am actionless and207 detached you will be freed from worldly bondage as a result of this full enlightenment this is the purport through the verse beginning with the ladle is brahman etc complete illumination has been represented as a sacrifice and sacrifices of various kinds have been taught with the help of some translate this as as compared with tr those sacrifices that are meant for accomplishing desireable human ends knowledge considered as a sacrifice is being extolled how 433 o destroyer of enemies knowledge considered as a sacrifice is greater than sacrifices requiring materials o son of prtha all actions in their totality culminate in knowledge english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 433 o destroyer of enemies jnana yajnah knowledge considered as a sacrifice is sreyan greater dra vyamayat yajnat than sacrifices requiring materials including study of the vedas etc also for a sacrifice performed with materials is an originator of results worldly prosperity attaining heaven etc but knowledge considered as a sacrifice is not productive of results it only208 reveals the state of liberation that is an achieved fact according to advaitism liberation consists in the removal of ignorance by illumination nothing new is produced thereby tr hence it is greater more praise worthy how because sarvam all karma akhilam actions in their totality without exception o son of prtha parisamapyate culminate get merged attain their consummation jnane in knowledge which is a means to liberation and is comparable to a fl ood all around cf246 this is the idea which accords with the upanisadic text as when the face of a die bearing the number 4 called krta wins the other inferior numbers on the die faces get included in it so whatever good actions are perfor med by beings all that gets merged in this one raikva so it happens to anyone who knows what he raikva knew ch 414 in that case by what means is this highly estimable knowledge acquired the answer is being given 434 know that through prostration inquiry and service the wise ones who have realized the truth will impart the knowledge to you english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda209 434 viddhi know tat that the process by which it is acquired by approaching teachers pranipatena through prostration by lying fully streched on the ground with face downward with prolonged salutation pariprasnena through inquiry as to how bondage and liberation come and what are knowledge and ignor ance and sevaya through the service of the guru know it through these and other disciplines other disciplines such as control of the mind body etc sankaracaryas own words in the commentary are evamadina after which ast puts a full stop and a greeing with this ag says that the word viddhi know is to be connected with evamadina hence this translation alternatively those words have to be taken with prasrayena then the meaning will be being pleased with such and other forms of humility tr being pleased with humility jnaninah the wise ones the teachers tattva darsinah who have realized the truth upadeksyanti will impart will tell te you jnanam the knowledge as described above although people may be wise some of them a re apt to know truth just as it is while others may not be so hence the qualification who have realized the truth the considered view of the lord is that knowledge imparted by those who210 have full enlightenment becomes effective not any other that b eing so the next verse also becomes appropriate 435 knowing which o pandava arjuna you will not come under delusion again in this way and through which you will see all beings without exception in the self and also in me english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 435 jnatva knowing yat which by acquiring which knowledge imparted by them o pandava na vasyasi you will not come under moham delusion punah again evam in this way in the way you have come under delusion now besides yena through which knowledge draksyasi you will see directly bhutani all beings asesena without exception counting from brahma down to a clump of grass atmani in the self in the innermost self thus these beings exist in me and atha also see that these are mayi in me in vasudeva the supreme lord the purport is you will realize the identity of the individual self and god which is well known in the upanisads moreover the greatness of this k nowledge is211 436 even if you be the worst sinner among all sinners still you will cross over all the wickedness with the raft of knowledge alone english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 436 api cet asi even if you be papa krttamah the worst sinner extremely sinful sarvebhyah among all papebhyah the sinners papa lit sin means here sinner still santarisyasi you will cross over sarvam all the vrjinam wickedness the oce an of wickedness sin ast reads papa samudram ocean of sin in place of papam tr jnana plavena eva with the raft of knowledge alone by using knowledge alone as a float here here in the scriptures imparting spiritual instructions righteousne ss formal religious observance too is said to be an evil in the case of one aspiring for liberation how knowledge destroys sin is being told with the help of an illustration 437 o arjuna as a blazing fire reduces pieces of wood to ashes simila rly the fire of knowledge reduces all actions to ashes212 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 437 o arjuna yatha as a samiddhah blazing agnih fire a well lighted fire kurute reduces edhamsi pi eces of wood bhasmasat to ashes tatha similarly jnanagnih the fire of knowledge knowledge itself being the fire kurute reduces bhasmasat to ashes sarva karmani all actions ie it renders them ineffective for the fire of knowledge itself cann ot directly knowledge destroys ignorance and thereby the idea of agentship is eradicated this in turn makes actions impossible burn actions to ashes like pieces of wood so the idea implied is that full enlightenment is the cuase of making all actio ns impotent from the force the context if the body were to die just with the dawn of knowledge imparting of knowledge by enlightened persons would be impossible and thus there would be no teacher to transmit knowledge it follows that since the resul t of actions owing to which the present body has been born has already become effective therefore it gets eshausted only through experiencing it hence knowledge reduces to ashes only all those actions that were done in this213 life prior to the rise of k nowledge and that have not become effective as also those performed along with ie after the dawn of knowledge and those that were done in the many past lives since this is so therefore 438 indeed there is nothing purifying here comparable to knowledge one who has become perfected after a long time through yoga realizes that by himself in his own heart english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 438 hi indeed na vidyate there is nothing pavitram purifying sanctifying iha here sadrsam comparable jnanena to knowledge yoga samsiddhah one who has become perfected who as attained fitness through yoga the seeker after liberation who has become samsiddhah purified qualified yogena t hrough the yoga of karma and the yoga of concentration kalena after a long time vindati realizes ie attains tat that knowledge verily svayam by himself atmani in his own heart that means by which knowledge is invariably attained is being ta ught214 439 the man who has faith is diligent and has control over the organs attains knowledge achieving knowledge one soon attains supreme peace english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 439 sraddha van the man who has faith labhate attains jnanam knowledge even when one has faith he may be indolent therefore the lord says tatparah who is diligent steadfast in the service of the teacher etc which are the means of attaining knowledge eve n when one has faith and is diligent one may not have control over the organs hence the lord says samyata indriyah who has control over the organs he whose organs indriyani have been withdrawn samyata from objects he who is such who is full of fa ith diligent and has control over the organs does surely attain knowledge however prostrations etc which are external are not invariably fruitful for there is scope for dissimulation faith etc but this is not so in the case of one possessing fait h etc hence they are the unfailing means of acquiring knowledge what again will result from gaining knowledge this is being answered labdhva215 achieving jnanam knowledge adhigacchati one attains acirena soon indeed param supreme santim peace supreme detachment called liberation that liberation soon follows from full knowledge is a fact well ascertained from all the scriptures and reasoning one should not entertain any doubt in this matter for doubt is the most vicious thing why the answ er is being stated 440 one who is ignorant and faithless and has a doubting mind perishes neither this world nor the next nor happiness exists for one who has a doubting mind english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 440 ajnah one who is ignorant who has not known the self and asradda dhanah who is faithless ast adds here guruvakya sastresu avisvasavan who has no faith in the instructions of the teacher and the scriptures tr and samsaya atma who has a doubting mind vinasyati perishes although the ignorant and the faithless get ruined yet it is not to the extent that a man with a doubting mind does as for one with a doubting mind he is the most vicious of them all216 how na ayam lokah neither this world which is familiar na nor also parah the next world na sukham nor happiness asti exist samsaya atmanah for one who has a doubting mind for doubt is possible even with regard to them therefore one should not entertain doubt w hy 441 o dhananjaya arjuna actions do not bind one who has renounced actions through yoga whose doubt has been fully dispelled by knowledge and who is not inadvertent english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 441 yoga sannyasta karmanam one who has renounced actions through yoga that person who is a knower of the supreme goal by whom actions called righteous or unrighteou s have been renounced through the yoga characterized as the knowledge of the supreme goal how does one become detached from actions through yoga the lord says he is jnana samchinna samsayah one whose doubts samsaya have been fully dispelled samchinn a by knowledge jnana characterized as the realization of the identity of the individual self and god o dhananjaya he who has thus217 renounced actions through yoga atmavantam who is not inadvertent not careless him karmani actions seen as the acti vities of the gunas see 328 na nibadhnanti do not bind ie they do not produce a result in the form of evil etc since one whose doubts have been destroyed by knowledge arising from the destruction of the impurities of body mind etc as result of the practise of karma yoga does not get bound by acitons owing to the mere fact of his actions having been burnt away by knowledge and since one who has doubts with regard to the practice of the yogas of knowledge and actions gets ruined 442 the refore o scion of the bharata dyasty take recourse to yoga and rise up cutting asunder with the sword of knowledge this doubt of your own in the heart arising from ignorance english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gamb hirananda 442 tasmat therefore o scion of the bharata dynasty atistha take recourse to ie undertake yogam yoga performance of actions which is a means to full illumination and now uttistha rise up for battle chittva cutting asunder jnan asina218 with the sword of knowledge knowledge is full illumination which is a destroyer of such defects as sorrows delusion etc that itself is the sword with that sword of knowledge enam this samsayam doubt atmanah of your own which is a source of ones own ruin and is most sinful hrtstham in the heart residing in the intellect ajnana sambhutam arising from ignorance born of nondiscrimination the word atmanah is used because doubt concerns oneself indeed anothers doubt cannot be remov ed by someone else hence the word own is used so although the doubt is with regard to the self it is really ones own219 chapter 5 51 arjuna said o krsna you praise renunciation of actions and again karma yoga tell me for certain that one which is better between these two english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 51 o krsna samsasi you praise ie speak of sannyasam renunciation karmanam of actions of performance of various kinds of rites enjoined by the scriptures punah ca and again you praise yogam yoga the obligatory performance of those very rit es therefore i have a doubt as to which is better is the performance of actions better or their rejection and that which is better should be undertaken and hence bruhi tell mam me suniscitam for certain as the one intended by you tat ekam that oneone of the two since performance of the two together by the same person is impossible yat which is sreyah better more commendable etayoh between these two between the renunciation of actions and the performance of actions ast reads karma yoga anusthana performance of karma yoga in place of karma anusthana performance of actions tr220 by undertaking which you think i shall acquire what is beneficial while stating his own opinion in order to arrive at a conclusion 52 the blessed lor d said both renunciation of actions and karma yoga lead to liberation between the two karma yoga however excels over renunciation of actions english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 52 ubhau both t o be sure sannyasah renunciation of actions ca and karma yogah karma yoga their performance nihsreyasa karau lead to liberation though both lead to liberation by virtue of being the cause of the rise of knowledge even then tayoh between the tw o which are the causes of liberation karma yoga tu however visisyate excels karma sannyasat over mere renunciation of actions thus he extols karma yoga karma yoga is better than renunciation of actions that is not based on knowledge why in ans wer the lord says221 53 he who does not hate and does not crave should be known as a man of constant renunciation english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 53 for o mighty armed one he who is free from duality becomes easily freed from bondage that performer of karma yoga yah who na dvesti does not hate anything and na kanksati does not crave jneyah should be known as nitya sannyasi a man of constant a man of constant renunciation he is a man of renunciation ever before the realization of the actionless self renunciation the meaning is that he who continues to be like this in the midst of sorrow happiness and their sources should be known as a man of constant renunciation even though enga ged in actions hi for mahabaho o mighty armed one nirdvandvah one who is free from duality pramucyate becomes freed sukham easily without trouble bandhat from bondage it is reasonable that in the case of renunciation and karma yoga which are opposed to each other and can be undertaken by different persons there should be opposition even between their results but it canot be that both of them222 surely lead to liberation when such a question arises this is the answer stated 54 the fools not the learned ones speak of sankhya the path of knowledge and karma yoga as different any one who properly resorts to even one of them gets the result of both english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirana nda 54 balah the fools na panditah not the learned ones pravadanti speak of sankhya yogau sankhya sankhya ie monasticism is that which is suited for sankhya self inquiry the path of knowledge and karma yoga as prthak different havi ng opposite and different results the learned ones the wise however admit one unconflicting result how any one who samyak properly asthitah resorts to ie follows ekam api even one between the path of knowledge and karma yoga vindate ge ts phalam the result ubhayoh of both for the result of both is that liberation itself therefore there is no conflict with regard to the result objection after beginning the topic with the words renunciation and karma yoga how is it that t he lord speaks of the identity223 of the results of the path of knowledge and karma yoga which is beside the point reply this defect does not arise although the question was put by arjuna merely with regard to renunciation and karma yoga yet the lord without actually avoiding them and by adding something special which was intended by him gave the answer by expressing them through other words sankhya and karma yoga those very renunciation and karma yoga when they are respectively assoc iated with knowledge and such of its means as equanimity etc are meant by the words sankhya and yoga this is the lords veiw therefore there is no discussion out of the context how can the result of both be attained by the proper performance of on ly one the answer is 55 the state sthana state is used in the derivative sense of the place in which one remains established and from which one does not become relegated that is reached by the sankhyas that is reached by the yogis as well he sees who sees sankhya and yoga as one english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda224 55 sthanam the state called liberation yat prapyate that is reached sankhyaih by the sankhyas by the monks steadfast i n knowledge tat prapyate that is reached yogaih by the yogis api as well the yogis are those who as a means to the attainment of knowledge undertake actions by dedicating them to god without seeking any result for themselves the purport is that by them also that stated is reached through the process of acquiring monasticism which is a result of the knowledge of the supreme reality therefore sah he pasyati sees truly yah who pasyati sees sankhya and yoga as ekam one because of the iden tity of their results this is the meaning objection if this be so then monasticism itself excels yoga why then is it said among the two karma yoga however excels renunciation of actions reply hear the reason for this having is veiw the mere giving up of actions and karma yoga your question was as to which one was better of the two my answer was accordingly given that karma yoga excels renunciation of actions resorted to without knowledge is sankhya this is what was meant by me and that is indeed yoga in the highest sense however that which is the vedic karma yoga is figuratively spoken of as yoga and renunciation since it leads to it supreme225 knowledge how does it lead to that the answer is 56 but o mighty armed one renunciation is hard to attain without karma yoga the meditative man equipped with yoga attains brahman without delay english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 56 tu but o mighty armed one sannyasah renunciation in the real sense duhkham aptum is hard to attain ayogatah without karma yoga munih the meditative man the word muni being derived in the sense of one who meditates on the real nature of god yoga yuktah equipped with yoga with vedic karma yoga in the form of dedication to god without thought of results for oneself adhigacchati attains brahma brahman na cirena without delay very quickly therefore it was said by me karma yoga excels karma yoga leads to enlightenment through the stages of attenuation of attachment withdrawal of the internal and external organs from their objects and their inclination towards the indwelling self also see commentary on 512 the monasticism under226 discussi on is called brahman because it leads to knowledge of the supreme self as stated in the upanisad nyasa monasticism is brahman brahman is verily the supreme ma na 212 brahman means monasticism in the real sense consisting in steadfastness to th e knowledge of the supreme self 57 endowed with yoga ie devoted to the performance of the nitya and naimittika duties pure in mind controlled in body a conqueror of the organs the self of the selves of all beings he does not become tainted e ven while performing actions the construction of the sentence is this when this person resorts to nitya and naimittika rites and duties as a means to the achievement of fully illumination and thus becomes fully enlightened then even when he acts thro ugh the apparent functions of the mind organs etc he does not become afflected english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 57 when again as a means to attain full enlightenment this person becomes yoga yuktah endowed with yoga visuddhatma pure in mind227 vijitatma controlled in body jitendriyah a conqueror of the organs and sarva bhutatma bhutatma the self of the selves of all beings one whose self atma the inmost consciousness has become the s elves atma of all beings sarva bhuta beginning from brahma to a clump of grass ie fully illumined then thus continuing in that state he na lipyate does not become tainted kurvan api even while performing actions for preventing mankind from going astray that is to say he does not become bound by actions and besides this person does not act in the real sense hence 5859 remaining absorbed in the self the knower of reality should think i certainly do not do anything even while seeing hearing touching smelling eating moving sleeping breathing speaking releasing holding opening and closing the eyes remembering that the organs function in relation to the objects of the organs english translation of sri sankaracharya s sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 58 yuktah remaining absorbed in the self tattva vit the knower of reality knower of the real nature228 of truth of the self ie the seer of the supreme reality manyeta should think na karomi eva i certainly do not do kincit anything having realized the truth when or how should he think this is being answered api even pasyan while seeing srnvan hearing sprsan touching jighran smelling asnan eating gacchan moving svapan sleeping sv asan breathing pralapan speaking visrjan releasing grhnan holding unmisan opening nimisan closing the eyes all these are to be connected with the above manyeta should think for the man who has known the truth thus who finds nothing but inac tion in action in all the movements of the body and organs and who has full realization there is competence only for giving up all actions because of his realization of the nonexistence of actions indeed one who proceeds to drink water in a mirage thi nking that water is there surely does not go there itself for drinking water even after knowing that no water exists there 510 one who acts by dedicating actions to brahman and by renouncing attachment he does not become polluted by sin just as a lotus leaf is not by water229 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 510 on the other hand again one who is ignorant of the truth and is engaged in karma yoga yah who karoti acts adhaya by dedicating by surrendering all karmani actions brahmani to brahman to god with the idea i am working for him as a servant does everything for his master and tyaktva by renouncing sangam attachment even with regard to teh resulting liberation sah he na lipyate does not get polluted is not affected papena by sin iva just as padma patram a lotus leaf is not ambhasa by water the only result that will certainly accrue from such action will be the purification of the heart 511 by giving up attachment the yogis undertake work merely through the body mind intellect and even the organs for the purification of themselves english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 511 since tyaktva by giving up sangam attachment with regard to results yoginah the230 yogis men of action kurvanti undertake karma work kevalaih merely this word is to be construed with each of the words body etc so as to deny the idea of own ership with regard to all actions kayena through the body manasa through the mind buddhya through the intellect and api even indriyaih through the organs which are devoid of the idea of ownership which are unassociated with ownership thus i act only for god and not for my gain atmasudhaye for the purification of themselves ie for the purification of the heart therefore you have competence only for that so you undertake action alone and also since 512 giving up the result of w ork by becoming resolute in faith one attains peace arising from steadfastness one who is lacking in resolute faith being attached to the result under the impulsion of desire becomes bound english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commenta ry swami gambhirananda 512 tyaktva giving up karma phalam the result of work yuktah by becoming resolute in faith by having this conviction thus actions are for god231 not for my gain apnoti attains santim peace called liberation naisthiki m arising from steadfastness it is to be understood that he attains this through the stages of purification of the heart acquisition of knowledge renunciation of all actions and steadfastness in knowledge on the other hand however he who is ayuktah lacking in resolute faith he phale saktah being attached to result thinking i am doing this work for my gain kama karena under the impulsion of desire kara is the same as karana action the action of desire kama kara under that impulsion of d esire ie being prompted by desire nibadhyate gets bound therefore you become resolute in faith this is the idea but one who has experienced the supreme reality 513 the embodied man of self control having given up all actions mentally contin ues happily in the town of nine gates without doing or causing others to do anything at all english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 513 aste he continues sukham happily sannyasya having given up s arva karmani all232 actions nitya naimittika kamya and nisiddha prohibited actions see note on p 128 tr manasa mentally through discriminating wisdom ie having given up all actions by seeing inaction in action etc freed from the activities of speech mind and body effortles placid in mind and devoid of all external wants which are different from the self he continues happily this is what has been said where and how does the vasi man of self control ie one who has his organs under control remain this is being answered nava dvare pure in the town with nine gates of which seven two ears two eyes nostrils and mouth are in the head for ones own experiences and two are below for urination and defecation as possessed of those gates it is called the town with nine gates being like a town the body is called a town with the self as its only master and it is inhabited by the organs mind intellect and objects like citizens as it were which serve its needs and which are pr oductive of many results and experience renouncing all actions the dehi embodied one resides in that town with nine gates objection what is the need of this specification for all embodied beings be they monks or not reside in bodies to be sure th at being so the specification is needless the answer233 is the embodied one however who is unenlightened who perceives merely the aggregate of the body and organs as the self he in his totality thinks i am in a house on the ground or on the seat for one who experiences the body alone as the self there can certainly be no such conviction as i am in the body like ones being in a house but for one who realizes the self as distinct from the aggregate of body etc it becomes reasonable to hav e the conviction i am in the bdoy it is reasonable that as a result of knowledge in the form of discriminating wisdom there can be a mental renunciation of the actions of others which have been ignorantly superimposed on the supreme self even in the case of one in whom has arisen discriminating wisdom and who has renounced all actions there can be like staying in a house the continuance in the body itself the town with nine gates as a consequence of the persistence of the remnants of the results of past actions which have started bearing fruit because the awareness of being distinct from the body arises while one is in the body itself form the point of veiw of the difference between the convictions of the enlightened and the unenlightened person s the qualifying words he continues in the body itself do have a purpose to serve although it has been234 stated that one continues in the body by relinquishing actions of the body and organs ignorantly superimposed on the self still there may be the apprehesion that direct or indirect agentship inheres in the self anticipating this the lord says na eva kurvan without himself doing anything at all and na karayan not causing others to do not inducing the body and organs to activity objectio n is it that the direct or indirect agentship of the embodied one inheres in the self and ceases to be after renunciation as the movement of a traveller ceases with the stoppage of his movement or is it that they do not exist owing to the very nature o f the self as to this the answer is the self by its nature has neither direct nor indirect agentship for it was stated it is said thatthis self is unchangeable 225 o son of kunti although existing in the body it does not act nor is it a ffected 1331 and it is also stated in the upanisad it seems to meditate as it were it seems to move as it were br 437 514 the self does not create agentship or any objects of desire for anyone nor association with the results of ac tions but it is nature that acts235 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 514 prabhuh the self na srjati does not create lokasya for anyone kartrtvam agentship by saying do this or even karmani any objects such objects as chariot pot palace etc which are intensely longed for nor even karma phala samyogam association with the results of actions association of the creator of a chariot etc with the result of his work objection if the embod ied one does not do anything himself and does not make others do then who is it that engages in work by doing and making others do the answer is tu but it is svabhavah nature ones own sva nature bhava characterized as ignorance maya which wi ll be spoken of in since this divine maya 714 pravartate that acts but from the highest standpoint 515 the omnipresent neither accepts anybodys sin nor even virtue knowledge remains covered by ignorance thereby the creatures become delude d english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda236 515 vibhuh the omnipresent na adatte neither accetps kasyacit anybodys even a adevotees papam sin na ca eva nor even does he accept sukrtam virtue off ered by devotees why then are such virtuous acts as worship etc as also sacrifices charity oblation etc worship etc as also sacrifices charity oblation etc offered by devotees to this the lord says jnanam knowledge discriminating wisdom rem ains avrtam covered ajnanena by ignorance tena thereby jantavah the creatures the non discriminating people in the world muhyanti become deluded thus i do i make others do i eat i make others eat 516 but in the case of those of whom that ignorance of theirs becomes destroyed by the knowledge of the self their knowledge like the sun reveals that supreme reality english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhiran anda 516 tu but yesam in the case of those creatures of whom tat ajnanam that ignorance atmanah of237 theirs being covered by which ignorance creatures get deluded nasitam becomes destroyed jnanena by knowledge by discriminating knowledge conc erning the self tesam their jnanam knowledge adityavat like the sun prakasayati reveals in the same way as the sun reveals all forms whatever tat param that supreme reality the reality which is the highest goal the totality of whatever is to b e known 517 those who have their intellect absorbed in that whose self is that who are steadfast in that who have that as their supreme goal they attain the state of non

as their supreme para goal ayana who have that alone as their supreme resort ie who are devoted only to the self those who have got their ignorance destroyed by knowledge those who are of this kind they gac chanti attain apunaravrttim the state of non returning non association again with a body jnana nirdhuta kalmasah their dirt having been removed destroyed by knowledge those whose dirt kalmasa the defect in the form of sin etc which are the ca use of transmigration have been removed destryed nirdhuta by the aforesaid knowledge jnana are jnana nirdhuta kalmasah ie the monks how do those learned ones whose ignorance regarding the self has been destroyed by knowledge look upon reality that is being stated 518 the learned ones look with equanimity on a brahmana endowed with learning and humality a cow an elephant and even a dog as well as an eater of dogs meat english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda239 518 panditah the learned ones sama darsinah look with equanimity brahmane on a brahmana vidya vinayasampanne endowed with learning and humility vidya means knowledge of the self and vinaya means pridelessness on a brahmana who has self knowledge and modesty gavi on a cow hastini on an elephant ca eva and even suni on a dog ca as well as svapake on an eater of dogs meat those learned ones who are habituated to see equally the unchanging same and one brahman absolutely untouched by the qualities of sattva etc and the tendencies created by it as also by the tendencies born of rajas and tamas in a brahmana who is endowed with knowledge and tranquillity who is possessed of good tendencies and the quality of sattva in a cow which is possessed of the middling quality of rajas and is not spiritually refined and in an elephant etc which are wholly and absolutely imbued with the quality of tamas they are seers of equality objection on the strength of the te xt a sacrificer incurs sin by not adoring equally one who is an equal and by adoring equally one who is an equal to himself gau sm 1720 are not they sinful whose food should not be eaten reply they are not open to the charge objection how240 519 here ie even while living in the body itself is rebirth conquered by them whose minds are established on sameness since brahman is the same in all and free from defects therefore they are established in brahman english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 519 iha eva here itself even while they are living is sargah rebirth jitah conquered overcome taih by them by the learned ones who see with equanimity yesam whose manah minds t he internal organs are sthitam established made steadfast samye on sameness in brahman that exists as the same in all beings it is nirdosam free from defects because of its existence in such mean objects as an eater of dogs meat etc though it is supposed by fools to be affected by the defects of those objects still it remains untouched by those blemishes hi because it is free from defects nor even is it differentiated by its qualities since consciousness is free from qualifications and the lord will speak of desires etc cf 136 etc as the attributes of the aggregate of body and organs and241 will also say being without beginning and without qualities 1331 nor even are there the ultimate distinctions which can create differentia tion in the self according to the vaisesikas everything is possessed of not only qualities but also of antya visesa ultimate distinction which is a category like substance quality action etc this distinction makes every entity different from othe r entities thus individual souls have their own ultimate distinctions by the very fact that they are individuals vedanta denies such a category besides the self is one and omnipresent therefore there is nothing else from which it can be distinguished tr because there is nothing to prove that these ultimate distinctions exist in every body hence samam brahma brahman is the same and one tasmat therefore te they sthitah are established brahmani in brahman itself as a result not even a sha de of defect touches them for they have no self identification in the form of perceiving the aggregate of body etc as the self on the other hand that statement gau sm 1720 refers to the man who has self identification in the form of perceiving the aggregate of body organs etc as the self for that statement a sacrificer incurs sin by not adoring equally one who is an242 equal and by adoring equally one who is not equal to himself pointedly refers to persons who are the objects of adoration it is indeed seen that in worship charity etc the determining factors are the possession of such special qualities as being a knower of brahman versed in the six auxiliary branches of vedic learning and versed in the four vedas but brahman is bere ft of association with all qualities and defects this being so it is logical that they are established in brahman and adoring an equal an unequal etc has reference to men of action those engaged in actions with a sense of agentship etc tr but this subject under consideration beginning from the embodied manhaving given up all actions mentally 13 to the end of the chapter is concerning one who has given up all actions since the self is brahman which is without blemish and is the sam e in all therefore 520 a knower of brahman who is established in brahman should have his intellect steady and should not be deluded he should not get delighted by getting what is desirable nor become dejected by getting what is undesirable243 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 520 brahmavit a knower of brahman as described sthitah who is established brahmani in brahman who is not a performer of actions ie one who has renounced all ac tions sthira buddhih should have his intellect steady the man of steady intellect is one who has the unwavering firm conviction of the existence of the one and the same taintless self in all beings and further asammudhah he should not be deluded he should be free from delusion na prahrsyet he should not get delighted prapya by getting priyam what is desirable na ca udvijet and surely neither should he become dejected prapya by getting apriyam what is undesirable because the acquisition o f the desirable and the undesirable are causes of asts reading is horsa visadau kurvate cause happiness and sorrow in place of harsa visada sthane sources of happiness and sorrow which latter reading occurs in g1 pr and aa tr happiness and sorrow for one who considers the body as the self not for the one who has realized the absolute self since in his case there can be no acquisition of desirable and undesirable objects further the one who is established in brahman244 521 with his he art unattached to external objects he gets the bliss that is in the self with his heart absorbed in meditation on brahman he acquires undecaying bliss english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 521 asakta atma with his heart internal organ unattached bahya sparsesu to external objects sparsah means objects that are contacted viz sound etc bahya sparsah means those things which are external bahya and are objects of contact that person who thus has his heart unattached who derives no happiness from objects he vindati gets that sukham bliss yat which is atmani in the self brahma yoga yukta atma with his heart absorbed in meditation on brahman meditation yoga on brahman is brahma yoga one whose internal organ atma is absorbed in yukta engaged in that meditation on brahman is brahma yoga yukta atma he asnute acquires aksayam undecaying sukham bliss so he who cherishes undecaying happiness in the self should withdraw the organs from the momentary245 happiness in external objects this is the meaning for this reason also one should withdraw 522 since enjoyments that result from contact with objects are verily the sources of sorrow and have a beginning and an end therefore o son of kunti the wise one does not delight in them english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 522 hi since bhogah enjoyments ye samsparsajah that result from contact with objects that arise from co ntact between the objects and the organs are eva verily duhkha yonayah sources of sorrow because they are creations of ignorance it is certainly a matter of experience that physical and other sorrows are created by that itself by the use of the word eva verily it is understood that as it happens here in this world so does it even in the other world realizing that there is not the least trace of happiness in the world one should withdraw the organs from the objects which are comparable to a mir age not only are they sources of sorrow they also adi antavantah have a beginning and an end adi beginning of enjoyments consists in the contact between objects246 and senses and their end anta indeed is the loss of that contact hence they have a beginning and an end they are impermanent being present in the intervening moment this is the meaning therefore o son of kunti budhah the wise one the discriminating person who has realized the reality which is the supreme goal na ramate does not delight tesu in them in enjoyments for delight in objects is seen only in very foolish beings as for instance in animals etc this extremely painful evil which is opposed to the path of bliss and is the source of getting all miseries is difficult to resist therefore one must make the utmost effort to avoid it hence the lord says 523 one who can withstand here itself before departing from the body the impulse arising from desire and anger that man is a yogi he is happy english translat ion of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 523 yah saknoti one who can is able to sodhum withstand iha eva here itself while alive prak before sarira vimoksanat departing from the body till death death is put as a limit because the247 impulse of desire and anger is certanily inevitable for a living person for this impulse has got infinite sources one should not relax until his death that is the idea kama desire is the hankering thirst with regard to a coveted object of an earlier experience and which is a source of pleasure when it comes within the range of the senses or is heard of or remembered and krodha anger is that repulsion one has against what are adverse to oneself and are sources of sorrow when they are seen heard of or remembered that impulse veda which has those desire and anger as its source udbhava is kama krodha udbhava vegah the impulse arising from desire is a kind of mental agitation and has the signs of horripilation joyful eyes face etc the impulse of anger has the signs of trembling of body perspiration bitting of lips red eyes etc he who is able to withstand that impulse arising from desire and anger sah narah that man is yuktah a yogi and sukhi is happy in this world what kind of a person being established in brahman attains brahman the lord says 524 one who is happy within whose pleasure is within and who has his light only within that248 yogi having become brahman attains absorption in brahman english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 524 yah antah sukhah one who is happy within in the indwelling self and so also antar aramah has pleasure within he disports only in the self within similarly antar jyotih eva has his light only within has the indwelling self alone as his light he has not to depend on the organs like ear etc for acquiring knowledge sah yogi that yogi yah who is of this kind brahma bhutah having become brahman even while he is still living adhigacchati attains brahma nirvanam absorption in brahman gets liberation besides 525 the seers whose sins have been attenuated who are freed from doubt whose organs are under control who are engaged in doing good to all beings attain absorption in brahman english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami ga mbhirananda249 525 rsayah the seers those who have full realization the monks ksina kalmasah whose sins defects like sin etc have been attenuated chinna dvaidhah who are freed from doubt yata atmanah whose organs are under control ratah who a re engaged sarvabhutahite in doing good to all beings favourably disposed towards all ie harmless labhante attain brahma nirvanam absorption in brahman liberation further 526 to the monks who have control over their internal organ who are f ree from desire and anger who have known the self there is absorption in brahman either way english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 526 yatinam to the monks yata cetasam who have control over their in ternal organ kama krodha viyuktanam who are free from desire and anger vidita atmanam who have known the self ie who have full realization vartate there is brahma nirvanam absorption in brahman liberation abhitah either way whether living o r dead immediate liberation of the monks who are steadfast in full realization has been stated and250 the lord has said and will say at every stage that karma yoga undertaken as a dedication to brahman to god by surrendering all activities the activit ies of body mind and organs to god leads to liberation through the stages of purification of the heart attainment of knowledge and renunciation of all actions thereafter now with the idea i shall speak elaborately of the yoga of meditation which is the proximate discipline for full realization the lord gave instruction through some verses in the form of aphorisms 527528 keeping the external objects outside the eyes at the juncture of the eye brows and making equal the outgoing and incom ing breaths that move through the nostrils the contemplative who has control over his organs mind and intellect should be fully intent on liberation and free from desire fear and anger he who is ever is verily free english translation of sri sanka racharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 527 krtva keeping bahyan the external sparsan objects sound etc bahih outside to one who does not pay attention to the external objects like sound251 etc brought to the intellect through the e ar etc the objects become verily kept outside having kept them out in this way and keeping the caksuh eyes antare at the juncture bhruvoh of the eye brows the word keeping has to be supplied and similarly samau krtva making equal prana apanau the outgoing and the incoming breaths nasa abhyantara carinau that move through the nostrils munih the contemplative derived from the root man in the sense of contemplating the monk yata indriya mano buddhih who has control over his orga ns mind and intellect should be moksa para yanah fully intent on liberation keeping his body is such a posture the contemplative should have liberation itself as the supreme goal he should be vigata iccha bhaya krodhah free from desire fear and ange r the monk yah who sada ever remains thus sah he is muktah yah whosada ever remains thus sah he is muktah ever verily free he has no other liberation to seek after what is there to be realized by one who has his mind thus concentrated the answer this is beig stated 529 one attains peace by knowing me who as the great lord of all the worlds am the enjoyer of252 sacrifices and austerities and who am the friend of all creatures english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit com mentary swami gambhirananda 529 rcchati one attains santim peace complete cessation of transmigration jnatva by knowing mam me who am narayana who as the sarva loka mahesvaram great lord of all the worlds am the bhoktaram enjoyer of the fruits yajna tapasam of sacrifices and austerities as the performer and the deity of the sacrifices and austerities respectively and who am the suhrdam friend sarva bhutanam of all creatures who am the benefactor of all without consideration of return who exist in the heart of all beings who am the dispenser of the results of all works who am the witness of all perceptions253 chapter 6 61 the blessed lord said he who performs an action which is his duty without depending on the result of action he is a monk and a yogi but not so in he who does not keep a fire and is actionless english translation of sri sankaracharyas san skrit commentary swami gambhirananda 61 anasritah without depending on on what on that which is karma phalam the result of action ie without craving for the result of action he who craves for the results of actions becomes dependent on the re sults of actions but this person is the opposite of such a one hence it is said wihtout depending on the result of action having become so yah he who karoti performs accomplishes karma an action which is his karyam duty the nityakarmas suc h as agnihotra etc which are opposed to the kamya karmas whoever is a man of action of this kind is distinguished from the other men of action in order to express this idea the lord says sah he is a sannyasi monk and a yogi sanyyasa means254 renun ciation he who is possessed of this is a sannyasi a monk and he is also a yogi yoga means concentration of mind he who has that is a yogi it is to be understood that this man is possessed of these qualities it is not to be understood that only that person who does not keep a fire niragnih and who is actionless akriyah is a monk and a yogi niragnih is one from whom the fires viz garhapatya ahavaniya anvaharya pacana etc which are the accessories of rites have bocome dissociated by kriya are mean austerity charity etc which are performed wityout fire akriyah actionless is he who does not have even such kriyas objection is it not only with regard to one who does not keep a fire and is acitonless that monasticsm and meditativeness a re well known in the vedas smrtis and scriptures dealing with meditation why are monasticism and meditativeness spoken of here with regard to one who keeps a fire and is a man of action which is not accepted as a fact reply this defect does not arise because both are sought to be asserted in some secondary sense objection how is that reply his being monk is by virtue of his having given up hankering for the results of actions and his being a man of meditation is from the fact of his doing actions as accesories to meditation or from255 his rejection of thoughts for the results of actions which cause disturbances in the mind thus both are used in a figurative sense on the contrary it is not that monasticism and meditativeness are meant in the primary sense with a veiw to pointing out this idea the lord says 62 that which they call monasticism know that to be yoa o pandava for nobody who has not given up expectations can be a yogi english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commen tary swami gambhirananda 62 yam that which is characterized by the giving up of all actions and their results which prahuh they the knowers of the vedas and the smrtis call sannyasam iti monasticism in the real sense viddhi known tam that monasticism in the real sense to be yogam yoga consisting in the performance of actions o pandava accepting what kind of similarity between karma yoga which is characterized by engagement in actions and its opposite renunciation in the real sense which is characterized by cessation from work has their equation been stated when such an apprehension arises the answer is this from the256 point of view of the agent there does exist a simialrity of karma yoga with real renunciation for he who is a monk in the real sense from the very fact of his having given up all the means needed for accomplishing actions gives up the thought of all actions and their results the source of desire that leads to engagement in work thoughts about an object lead to the desire for it which in turn leads to actions for getting it also see note under 419 also even while performing actions gives up the thought for results pointing out this idea the lord says hi for kascit nobody no man of action whosoever asannyasta sankalpah who has not given up expactaions one by whom has not been renounced expectation anticipation of resultsbhavati becomes ie can become yogi a yogi a man of concentration because thought of results is the cause of the distur bance of mind therefore any man of action who gives up the thought of results would become a yogi a man of concentration with an unperturbed mind because of his having given up thought of results which is the cause of mental distractions this is the p urport thus because of the similarity of real monasticism with karma yoga from the point of veiw of giving up by the agent karma yoga is extolled as monasticism in257 that which they call monasticism know that to be yoga o pandava since karma yoga w hich is independent of results is the remote help to dhyana yoga therefore it has been praised as monasticism thereafter now the lord shows how karma yoga is helpful to dhyana yoga 63 for the sage who wishes to ascend to dhyana yoga action is said to be the means for that person when he has ascended to dhyana yoga inaction alone is said to be the means english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 63 aruruksoh for one who wishes to ascend who has not ascended ie for that very person who is unable to remain established in dhyana yoga for which person who is desirous to ascend munch for the sage ie for one who has renounced the results of actions trying to ascend to what yogam to dhy ana yoga karma action ucyate is said to be the karanam means tasya for that person again yoga arudhasya when he has ascended to dhyana yoga samah inaction withdrawl from all actions eva alone ucyate is said to be karanam the means for remaining258 poised in the state of meditation this is the meaning to the extent that one withdraws from actions the mind of that man who is at cease and selfcontrolled becomes concentrated when this occurs he at once becomes established in yoga and accordingly has it been said by vyasa for a brahmana there is no wealth conparable to the knowledge of oneness sameness truthfulness character equipoise harmlessness straightforwardness and withdrawal from various actions mbh sa 17537 af ter that now is being stated when one becomes established in yoga 64 verily verily this word emphasizes the fact that since attachment to sense objects like sound etc and to actions is an obstacle in the path of yoga therefore the removal of th at obstruction is the means to its attainment when a man who has given up thought about everything does not get attached to sense objects or acitons he is then said to be established in yoga english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 64 hi verily yada when a yogi who is concentrating his mind sarva sankalpa sannyasi259 who has given up thought about everything who is apt to give up sannyasa all sarva thoughts sankalpa which are the causes of desire for things here and hereafter na anusajjate does not become attached ie does not hold the idea that they have to be done by him indriya arthesu with regard to sense objects like sound etc and karmasu with regard to actions nitya naimittika kamya and nisiddha prohibited because of the absence of the idea of their utility tada then at that time ucyate he is said to be yoga arudhah established in yoga ie he is said to have att ained to yoga from the expression one who has given up thought about eveything it follows that one has to renounce all desires and all actions for all desires have thoughts as their source this accords with such smrti texts as verily desire has t hought as its source sacrifices arise from thoughts ma sm 23 o desire i know your source you surely spring from thought i shall not think of you so you will not arise in me mbh sa 17725 and when one gives up all desires renunciation of all actions becomes accomplished this agrees with such upanisadic texts as this self is identified with desire alone what it desires it resolves what it resolves it works out br 445 and also such smrti texts as whatever actions a man doe s260 all that is the effect of desire itself ma sm 24 it accords with reason also for when all thoughts are renounced no one can even move a little so by the expression one who has given up thought about everything the lord makes one renounce d all desires and all actions when one is thus established in yoga then by that very fact ones self becomes uplifted by oneself from the worldly state which is replete with evils hence 65 one should save oneself by oneself one should not lower o neself for oneself is verily ones onw friend oneself is verily ones own enemy english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 65 uddharet one should save atmanam oneself sunk in the sea of the world atmana by oneself one should save ut haret should uplift oneself from that ie make it attain the state of being established in yoga na avasadayet one should not lower debase atmanam oneself hi for atma eva oneself is verily atmanah ones own bandhuh friend centainly there is no other friend who can bring about liberation from this world in fact even a friend is an obstacle to liberation he being the261 source of such bondages as love etc therefore the emphatic statement for one is ones o wn friend is justifiable atma eva oneself verily is atmanah ones own ripuh enemy anyone else who is an external harmful enemy even he is of ones own making therefore the firm conclusion oneself verily is ones own enemys is reasonable it ha s been said that oneself is verily ones own friend oneself verily is ones own enemy as to that the self ast has this additional word atma self tr of what kind is ones own friend or the self of what kind is ones own enemy this is being answered 66 of him by whom has been conquered his very self by the self his self is the friend of his self but for one who has not conquered his self his self itself acts inimically like an enemy english translation of sri sankaracharyas san skrit commentary swami gambhirananda 66 tasya of him yena by whom jitah has been conquered subdued his eva atma very self the aggregate of body and organs that atma self is bandhuh the friend atmanah of his self the idea is that he is a conqueror of his senses tu but262 anatmanah for one who has not conquered his self who has no self control atma eva his self itself varteta acts satruvat like an enemy satrutve inimically with the attitude of an enemy as an enemy who is diff erent from oneself does harm to oneself similarly ones self behaves like an enemy to oneself this is the meaning if the body and organs are under control they are helpful in concentrating ones mind on the self but if they are not under control t hey oppose this concentration 67 the supreme self of one who has control over the aggregate of his body and organs and who is tranquil becomes manifest he should be equipoised these words are supplied to complete the sentence in the midst of cold and heat happiness and sorrow as also honour and dishonour english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 67 parama atma the supreme self jita atmanah of one who has control over the aggregate of his bo dy and organs prasantasya who is tranquil who is a monk with his internal organ placid samahitah263 becomes manifest ie becomes directly manifest as his own self moreover he should be equipoised sitausna sukha duhkhesu in the midst of cold and heat happiness and sorrow tatha as also mana apamanayoh in honour and dishonour adoration and despise 68 one whose mind is satisfied with knowledge and realization who is unmoved who has his organs under control is sadi to be self absorbed the yogi treats equally a lump of earth a stone and gold english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 68 a yogi jnana vijnana trpta atma whose mind is satisfied with knowledge and realization jnana is thorough knowledge of things presented by the scriptures but vijnana is making those things known from the scriptures a subject of ones own realization just as they have been presented he whose mind atma has become contented trpta with those jnana and vijnan a is jnana vijnana trpta atma kutasthah who is unmoved ie who becomes unshakable and vijita indriyah who has his organs under control he who is of this kind264 ucyate is said to be yuktah self absorbed that yogi sama losta asma kancanah treats equally a lump of earth a stone and gold further 69 he excels who has sameness of view with regard to a benefactor a friend a foe ari foe is one who does harm behind ones back a neutral an arbiter the hateful dvesyah is one who openly hateful a relative good people and even sinners english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 69 the first line of the verse beginning with benefactor etc is a single compound word visisyate he excels ie he is the best among all those who are established in yoga a different reading is vimucyate he becomes free sama buddhih who has sameness of view ie whose mind is not engaged with the question of who one is and what he does with regard to a suhrd benefactor one who does some good without consider ation of return mitram a friend one who is affectionate arih a foe udasinah a neutral who sides with nobody madhyasthah an arbiter who is a well wisher of two conflicting parties dvesyah the hateful who is repulsive to oneself bandhuh a265 relative to all these as also sadhusu with regard to good people who follow the scriptures api ca and even papesu sinners who perform prohibited actions with regard to all of them therefore to acquire this excellent result 610 a yogi should co nstantly concentrate his mind by staying in a solitary place alone with mind and body controlled free from expectations and free from acquisition english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 610 a yogi a man of meditation satatam yunjita should constantly concentrate atmanam his mind sthitah by staying rahasi in a solitary place in mountain caves etc ekaki alone without any companion yata citta atma with mind and body controlled nirasih w ithout expectations free from hankering and aparigrahah free from acquisition from the uise of the qualifying words in a solitary place and alone it follows that he has to undertake all these after espousing monasticism and even after renuncia tion he should concentrate his mind by desisting from all acquisition this is the meaning now then have to be stated the rules266 regarding seat food movements etc as disciplines for yoga in the case of one practising concentration as also the signs o f one who has succeeded in yoga and the consequent result etc hence this is begun among these the seat is being first spoken of 611 having firmly established in a clean place his seat neither too high nor too low and made of cloth skin and kusa grass placed successively one below the other english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 611 see commentary under 612 612 and sitting on that seat he should concentrate his mind for the purification of the internal organ making the mind one pointed and keeping the actions of the mind and senses under control english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 612 pratisthapya having established sthiram firml y sucau in a clean dese place which is267 solitary either naturally or through improvement atmanah his own asanam seat na ati ucchritam neither too high na ati nicam nor even too low and that made of caila ajina kusa uttram cloth skin and ku sagrass placed successively one below the other the successive arrangement of cloth etc here is in a reverse order to that of the textual reading what follows after thus establishing the seat upavisya sitting tatra on that asane seat yogam yunj yat he should concentrate his mind to what purpose should he concentrate his mind in answer the lord says atma visuddhaye for the purification of the internal organ how krtva making manah the mind ekagram one pointedby withdrawing it from all objects and yata citta indriya kriyah keeping the actions kriyah of the mind citta and senses indriya under control yata the external seat has been spoken of now is being stated how the posture of the body should be 613 holding the body head and neck erect and still being steady looking at the tip of his own nose and not looking around english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda268 613 see commentary under 614 614 he should remain seated with a placid mind free from fear firm in the vow of a celibate and with the mind fixed on me by controlling it through concentration having me as the supreme goal english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit comm entary swami gambhirananda 614 dharayan holding kaya sirogirvam the body torso head and neck samam erect and acalam still movement is possible for one even while holding these erect therefore it is specified still sthirah being ste ady ie remaining steady sampreksya looking svam nasikagram at tip of his own nose looking at it intently as it were ca and anavalokayan not looking disah around ie not glancing now and then in various directions the words as it were ar e to be understood because what is intended here is not an injunction for looking at the tip of ones own nose what then it is the fixing the gaze of the eyes by withdrawing it from external objects and that is enjoined with a veiw to concentrating the mind what is sought to269 be presented here as the primary objective is the concentration of mind if the gaze be directed outward then it will result in interrupting that concentration therefore the purpose is to first fix the gaze of the eyes within i f the intention were merely the looking at the tip of the nose then the mind would remain fixed there itself not on the self in making the mind fixed in the self 25 the lord will speak of concentrating the mind verily on the self therefore owing to the missing word iva as it were it is merely the withdrawl of the gaze that is implied by sampreksya looking further prasantatma with a placid mind with a mind completely at peace vigata bhih free from fear sthitah firm brahmacari vrate i n the vow of a celibate the vow cosisting in serivce of the teacher eating food got by beggin etc firm in that ie he should follow these besides mat cittah with the mind fixed on me who am the supreme god samyamya by controlling manah the min d ie by stopping the modifications of the mind yuktah through concentration ie by becoming concentrated asita he should remain seated matparah with me as the supreme goal some passionate person may have his mind on a woman but he does not acc ept the woman as his supreme goal what then he accepts the king or sive as his270 goal but this one the yogi not only has his mind on me but has me as his goal after that now is being stated the result of yoga 615 concentrating the mind thus for e ver the yogi of controlled mind achieves the peace which culminates in liberation and which abides in me english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 615 yunjan concentrating atmanam the mind evam thus a ccording to the methods shown above sada for ever the yogi niyata manasah of controlled mind adhi gacchati achieves santim the peace the indifference to worldly attachments and possessions nirvana paramam which culminates in liberation and mat samstham which abides in me now are bieng mentioned the rules about the yogis food etc 616 but o arjuna yoga is not for one who eats too much nor for one who does not eat at all neither for one who habitually sleeps too long nor surely for on e who keeps awake271 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 616 tu but o arjuna yoga na asti is not atiasnatah for one who eats too much for one who eats food more than his capacity na ca nor i s yoga anasnatah for one who does not eat ekantam at all this accords with the vedic text as is well known if one eats that much food which is within ones capacity then it sustains him it does not hurt him that which is more it harms him that which is less it does not sustain him sa br bo sm 2722 therefore a yogi should not eat food more or less than what is suitable for him or the meaning is that yoga is not for one who eats more food than what is prescribed for a yogi in the scriptures on yoga indeed the quantity has been mentioned in one half of the stomach is to be filled with food including curries the third quarter is to be filled with water but the fourth quarter is to be left for the movement of air etc similarly yoga is not for ati svapna silasya one who habitually sleeps too long and yoga is na eva surely not jagratah for one who keeps awake too long how again does yoga become possibel this is being stated272 617 yoga becomes a destroyer of sorrow of one whose eating and movements are regulated whose effort in works is moderate and whose sleep and wakefulness are temperate english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 617 yogah bhavati yoga becomes duhkha ha a destroyer of sorrow that which destroys hanti all sorrows duhkhani ie yoga destroys all worldly sorrows yukta ahara viharasya of one whose eating and movements are regulated ahara lit food means all that is gathered in according to the commentator ahara which also means food includes mental food as well see ch 7262 tr and vihara means moving about walking one for whom these two are regulated yukta is yukta ahara vihara and also yukta cestasya of one whose effort cesta is moderate yukta karmasu in works similarly yukta svapna avabodhasya of one whose sleep svapna and wakefulness avabodha are temperate yukta have regulated periods to him whose eating and movement s are273 regulated whose effort in work is moderate whose sleep and wakefulness are temperate yoga becomes a destroyer of sorrows when does a man become concentrated that is being presently stated 618 a man who has become free from hankering for all desirable objects is then said to be self absorbed when the controlled mind rests in the self alone english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 618 a yogi nihsprhah who has become free from hankering thirs t sarva kamebhyah for all desirable objects seen and unseen is tada then ucyate said to be yuktah self absorbed yada when the viniyatam controlled cittam mind the mind that has been made fully one pointed by giving up thought of external ob jects avatisthate rests atmani eva in the non dual self alone ie he gets established in his own self an illustration in being given for the mind of that yogi which has become self absorbed274 619 as a lamp kept in a windless place does not flick er such is the simile thought of for the yogi whose mind is under control and who is engaged in concentration on the self english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 619 yatha as a dipah lamp nivata sthah kept in a windless place na ingate does not flicker sa upama such is the simile that with which something is compared is an upama smile smrta thought of by the knowers of yoga who understand the movements of the mind yoginah for the yogi ya tacitasya whose mind is under control and yunjatah who is engaged in yogam concentration atmanah on the self ie who is practising self absorption by dint of practising yoga thus when the mind comparable to a lamp in a windless place becomes concentrated then 620 at the time when the mind restrained through the practice of yoga gets withdrawn and just when by seeing the self by the self one remains contented in the self alone ag construes the word eva certainly with tusyati remai ns contented tr275 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 620 yatra at the time when cittam the mind niruddham restrained entirely prevented from wandering uparamate gets withdrawn yoga sevaya t hrough the practice of yoga ca and yatra eva just when at the very moment when pasyan by seeing by experiencing atmanam the self which by nature is the supreme light of consciousness atmana by the self by the mind purified by concentration t usyati one remains contented gets delighted atmani eva in ones own self alone samadhi is of two kinds samprajnata and asamprajnata the concentration called right knowledge samprajnata is that which is followed by reasoning discrimination blis ss and unqualified egoism asamprajnata is that which is attained by the constant practice of cessation of all mental activity in which the citta retains only the unmanifested impressions cf c w vol i 1962 pp 210 212 according to ag the verse s upto 620 state in a general way the characteristics of samadhi from the present verse to the 25th asamprajnata samadhi is introduced and defined tr besides276 621 when one experienece that absolute blisss which can be intuited by the intellect a nd which is beyond the senses and being established thus this

does not swerve tattvatah from that reality ie does not deviat e from the nature of reality further 622 obtaining which one does not think of any other acquisition to be superior to that and being

vicalyate one is not perturbed api even guruna by great duhkhena sorrow as may be caused by being struck with weapons etc the yoga that has been spoken of as a particular state of the self distinguished by its characterisics in th e verses beginning with at the time when the mind gets withdrawn 20 etc 623 one should know that severance of contact with sorrow to be what is called yoga that yoga has to be practised with perservance and with an undepressed heart english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 623 vidyat one should know tat that duhkha samyoga viyogam severance viyoga of contact samyoga with sorrow duhkha to be verily yoga sanjnitam what is called yoga ie oen should278 know it through a negative definition after concluding the topic of the result of yoga the need for pursuing yoga is again being spoken of in another way in order to enjoin preservance and freedom from depression as the disciplines fo r yoga sah that yogah yoga which has the results as stated above yoktavyah has to be practised niscayena with perservance and anirvinnacetasa with an undepressed heart that which is not a depressed nirvinnam is anirvinnam what is that the heart one has to practise yoga with that heart which is free from depression this is the meaning again 624 by totally eschewing all desires which arise from thoughts and restraining with the mind itself all the organs from every side englis h translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 624 see commentary under 625 625 one should gradually withdraw with the intellect endowed with steadiness making the mind fixed in the self one should not think of anything whatsoever279 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami

buddhya with the intellect possessed of what distinction dhrti grhitaya endowed with steadiness ie with fortitude krtva making manah the mind atma samstham fixed in the self with the idea the self alone is all there is nothing apart from it thus fixing the mind on the self na cintayet one should not think of kincit api anything whatsoever thisis the highest instruction about yoga 626 the yogi should bring this mind under the subjugation of the self itself by restrainin g it from all those causes whatever due to which the restless unsteady mind wanders away280 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 626 in the beginning the yogi who is thus engaged in making the mind esta blished in the self etat vasamnayet should bring this mind under the subjugation atmani eva of the self itself niyamya by restraining etat it tatah tatah from all those causes whatever viz sound etc yatah yatah due to which doe to whatever objects like sound etc the cancalam restless very restless and therefore asthiram unsteady manah mind niscarati wanders away goes out due to its inherent defects it should be restrained by ascertaining through discrimination those causes to be mere appearances and with an attitude of detachment thus through the power of practice of yoga the mind of the yogi merges in the self itself 627 supreme bliss comes to this yogi alone whose mind has become perfectly tranquil whose quality of rajas has been eliminated who has become identified with brahman and is taintless281 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit comment ary swami gambhirananda 627 uttamam supreme unsurpassable sukham blisss upaiti comes hi enam yoginam to this yogi alone prasanta manasam whose mind has become perfectly tranquil santa rejasam whose quality of rajas has been eliminated i e whose rajas viz defects such as delusion etc the five klesas pain bearing obstructions are ignorance egoism attachment aversion and clinging to life pysu23 have been destroyed brahma bhutam who has become identified with brahman who is free even while living who has got the certitude that bramhman is all and akalmasam who is taintless free from vice etc 628 by concentrating his mind constantly thus the taintless yogi easily attains the absolute bliss of contact with bra hman english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda282 628 sada yunjan by constantly concentrating atmanam his mind evam thus in the process stated vigata kalmasah the taintles sinless yogi free from the o bstacles to yoga sukhena easily asnute attains atayantam absolute that which exists by transcending limits supreme unsurpassable sukham bliss of brahma samsparsam contact with brahman the bliss that is in touch in touch with ie identified with homogeneous with in essential oneness with with the supreme brahman now is being shown that result of yoga which is the realization of identity with brahman and which is the cause of the extinction of the whole mundane existence liberation is conceived of in two ways total cessation of sorrows and attainment of unsurpassable bliss 629 one who has his mind self absorbed through yoga and who has the vision of sameness every where see this self existing in everything and every thing in his self english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda283 629 yoga yukta atma one who has his mind self absorbed through yoga whose mind is merged in samadhi and sarvatra sama darsanah who has the vision of sam eness everywhere who has the vision darsana of sameness sama tva the knowledge of identity of the self and brahman everywhere sarvatra without exception in all divergent objects beginning from brahma to immovable things iksate sees atmanam the self his own self sarva bhuta stham existing in everything and sarva bhutani everything from brahma to a clump of grass unified atmani in his self the fruit of this realization of the unity of the self is being stated 630 one who sees me in e verything and sees all things in me i do not out of his vision and he also is not lost to my vision english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 630 yah one who pasyati sees mam me vasudeva who am the self of all sarvatra in all things ca and sees sarvam all things all created things beginning from brahma mayi in me who am the self of all aham i who am god na pranasyami do not go out tasyaof his vision of284 one who has thus realized the un ity of the self ca sah and he also na pranasyati is not lost me to my vision that man of realization does not get lost to me to vasudeva because of the indentity between him and me for that which is called ones own self is surely dear to one an d since it is i alone who am the seer of the unity of the self in all 631 that yogi who being established in unity adores me as existing in all things he exist in me in whatever condition he may be english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 631 this being so ie after reiterating in the first line of the present verse the idea of full realization contained in the previous verse the result of that realization viz liberation is being spoken of in the second line the yogi the man of full realization vartate exists mayi in me in the supreme state of visnu sarvatha api in whatever condition vartamanah he may be he is verily ever free the idea is that he is not obstructed from liberation by anything furthermore285 632 o arjuna that yogi is considered the best who judges what is happiness and sorrow in all beings by the same standard as he would apply to himself english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 632 atma aupamyena atma means the self ie oneself that by which a comparison is made is an upama the abstract from of that is aupamya atma aupamya means a standard as would be applicab le to oneself o arjuna yah he who pasyati judges sarvatra in all beings samam by the same standard in the same manner atma aupamyena as he would apply to himself and what does he view with sameness that is being stated as sukham happiness is dear to me so also is happiness agreeable to all creatures va andthe word va is used in the sense of and just as yadi whatever duhkham sorrow is unfavourable unwelcome to me so also is sorrow unwelcome and unfavourable to all creatures in this way he looks upon happiness and sorrow as pleasant and unpleasant to all bengs by the same standard as he would apply to himself he does not act against anyone that is he is non injurious he who is thus non injurious and steadfast in full286 illum ination sah that yogi paramah matah is considered as the best among all the yogis noticing that his yoga as spoken of and consisting in full illumination is hard to acquire arjuna with a view to hearing the sure means to its attainment said 633 arjuna said o madhusudana krsna this yoga that has been spoken of by you as sameness i do not see its steady continuance owing to the restlessness of the mind english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhiran anda 633 o madhusudana ayam this yogah yoga yah proktah that has been spoken of tvaya by you samyena as sameness na pasyami i do not see i cannot conceive what etasya its sthiram steady undisturbed sthitim continuance cancalatvat owing to the unsteadiness of the mind which is well known 634 for o krsna the mind is unsteady turbulent strong and obstinate i consider its control to be as greatly difficult as of the wind287 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskri t commentary swami gambhirananda 634 hi for o krsna the word krsna is derived from the root krs another derivative meaning may be the capacity to draw towards himself all glorious things of this and the other world in the sense of uprooting he is krsna because he uproots the defects such as sin etc of devotees manah the mind is cancalam unsteady not only is it very unsteady it is also pramathi turbulent it torments agitates the body and the organs it brings them under extraneou s control besides it is balavat strong not amenable ot anybodys restraint again it is drdham obstinate hard as the large shark called tantu naga also known as varjuna pasa aham i manye consider tasya its of the mind which is of this kind nigrahah control restraint to be suduskaram greatly difficult vayoh iva as of the wind control of the wind is difficult i consider the control of the mind to be even more difficult than that this is the idea this is just as you say 635 the blessed lord said o mighty armed one undoubtedly the mind is untractable and restless288 but o son of kunti it is brought under control through practice and detachment english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gam bhirananda 635 mahabaho o mighty armed one asamsayam undoubtedly there is no doubt with regard to this that the manah mind is durnigraham untractable and calm restless tu but it the modifications of the mind in the form of distractions grhyate is brough t under control abhyasena through practice abhyasa means repetition of some idea or thought of the mind one some mental plane some mental plane suggests some object of concentration and vairagyena through detachment vairagya means absence of han kering for enjoyment of desirable things seen or unseen as a result of the practice of discerning their defect that mind is thus brought undr control restrained ie completely subdued by him however who has not controlled his mind 636 my con viction is that yoga is difficult to be attained by one of uncontrolled mind but it is289 possible to be attained through the above means by one who strives and has a controlled mind english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 636 me my matih conviction is iti that yoga is dusprapah difficult to be attained asamyata atmana by one of uncontrolled mind by one who has not controlled his mind the internal organ by practice and detachment tu but o n the other hand sakyah yoga is possible avaptum to be attained yatata by one who strives who repeatedly makes effort upayatah through the means described above and vasyatmany by one of controlled mind by him whose mind has been brought under c ontrol through practice and detachment as to that by accepting the practice of yoga actions leading to the attainment of this or the next world may be renounced by a yogi and yet he may not attain the result of perfection in yoga ie full illuminatio n which is the means to liberation consequently at the time of death his mind may waver from the path of yoga apprehending that he may be thereby ruined290 637 arjuna said o krsna failing to achieve perfection in yoga what goal does one attain who though possessed of faith is not diligent and whose mind becomes deflected from yoga english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 637 o krsna aprapya failing to achieve yoga samsiddhim perfection in y oga the result of yoga ie full illumination kam gatim what goal gacchati does one attain who though upetah sraddhaya possessed of faith belief in god and in the other world is ayatih not diligent devoid of effort on the path of yoga and at the time of death too calita manasah whose mind becomes deflected yogat from yoga ie whose memory has been lost 638 o mighty armed one fallen from both without support deluded on the path to brahman does he not get ruined like a scatte red cloud

anyah none other than you be he a sage or a god upapadyate can be chetta the despeller the destroyer asya of this samsayasya doubt therefore you yourself shoul d dispel the doubt this is the meaning 640 the blessed lord said o partha there is certainly no ruin for him here or hereafter for no292 one engaged in good meets with a deplorable end my son english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 640 o partha eva vidyate there is certainly na vinasah no ruin tasya for him iha here in this world or amutra hereafter in the other world ruin means a bi rth inferior to the previous one that is not there for one who has fallen from yoga hi for na kascit no one kalyana krt engaged in good gacchati meets with durgatim a deplorable end tata my son a father is called tata because he perpetuates h imself tanoti through the son since the father himself becomes the son therefore the son also is called tata a disciple is called putra son sri krsna addressed arjuna thus because the latter was his disciple but what happens to him 641 atta ining the worlds of the righteous and residing there for eternal years the man fallen from yoga is born in the house of the pious and the properous293 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 641 prapya att aining reaching lokan the worlds punya krtam of the righteous of the performers of the horse sacrifice etc and usitva residing there enjoying the stay for sasvatih eternal samah years then when the period of enjoyment is over the yoga bhrastah man fallen from yoga the one who had set out on the path yoga ie a monk as understood from the force of the context from arjunas question it minght appear that he was asking about the fate of people who fall from both the paths viz that of karma and of meditation but the possibility of getting ruined by performing actios rites and duties according to vedic instructions does not arise since their results are inevitable however the question of ruin is relevant in the case of a monk for on the one hand he has renounced actions and on the other he may fail to attain perfection in yoga in the present life hence the lords answer relates to the fall and ruin of a monk alone abhijayate is born gehe in the house sucinam of the pious who perform actions according to scriptural instructions and srimatam who are prosperous294 642 or he is born in the family of wise yogis persons possessing knowledge of brahman s concedes that some rare householders also can have this knowledge and he cites the instances of vasistha agastya janaka and asvapati of olden days and vacaspati and the author of khanada of recent times only such a birth as is of this kind is surely more difficult to get in the world english translation of sr i sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 642 athava or bhavati he is born kule in the family dhimatam of wise yoginam yogis eva only who are poor which is different from the family of the prosperous etat janma such a bir th yat idrsam as is of this kind a birth that is in the family of poor yogis in a family as described is hi surely durlabha taram more difficult to get as compared with the earlier one loke in the world becuase 643 there he becomes endowed with that wisdom acquired in the previous body and he strives more than before for perfection o scion of the kuru dynasty295 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 643 tatra there in the family of yogis labhate tam buddhisamyogam he becomes endowed with that wisdom paurva dehikam acquired in the previous body and yatate he strives bhuyah more intensely tatah than before more intensely than that tendency acquired in the previous birth samsidda u for for the sake of perfection kuru nandana o scion of the kuru dynasty how does he become endowed with the wisdom acquired in the previous body that is being answered 644 for by that very past practice he is carried forward even in spite of himself even a seeker of yoga transcends the result of the performance of vedic rituals english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 644 hi for tena eva by that very purva abhyasena past practice the powerful habit formed in the past life hiryate he the yogi who had fallen from yoga is carried forward avasah api even inspite of himself if he had not296 committed any act which could be characterized as unrigtheous etc and more powerful than the tendency created by the practice of yoga then he is carried forward by the tendency created by the practice of yoga if he had committed any unrighteous act which was more powerful the n even the tendency born of yoga gets surely overpowered but when that is exhausted the tendency born of yoga begins to take effect by itself the idea is that it does not get destroyed even though it may lie in abeyance over a long period jijnasuh ap i even a seeker yogasya of yoga from the force of the context the person implied is a monk who had engaged in the path of yoga with a desire to known his true nature but had falled from yoga even he ativartate trascends will free himself from sa bdabrahma the result of the performance of vedic ritual what to speak of him who after understanding yoga may undertake it with steadfastness and why is the state of yoga higher 645 however the yogi applying himself assiduously becoming purif ied from sin and attaining perfection through many births thereby acheives the highest goal297 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 645 the yogi the man of knowledge yatamanah applying himself prayatn at assiduously ie striving more intensely and as a result samsuddha kilbisah becoming purified from sin and aneka janma samsiddhah attaining perfection through many births gathering together tendencies little by little in many births and attaini ng perfection through that totality of impressions acquired in many births tatah thereby coming to have full illumination yati achieves the param highest most perfect gatim goal since this is so therefore 646 a yogi is higher than men of austerity he is considered higher even than men of knowledge the yogi is also higher than men of action therefore o arjuna do you become a yogi english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 646 a yogi is ad hikah higher tapasvibhyah than men of austerity he is matah considered adhikah higher than superior to api even jnanibhyah298 men of knowledge jnana here means scriptural learning a yogi is superior to even those who possess that learning t he yogi is adhikah higher greater karmibhyah than men of action karma means agnihotra etc greater than those who adhere to them since this is so tasmat therefore o arjuna bhava do you become a yogi 647 even among all the yogis he who ado res me with his mind fixed on me and with faithhe is considered by me to be the best of the yogis english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 647 api even sarvesam yoginam among all the yogis among those who are immersed in meditation on rudra aditya and others yah he who bhajate adores mam me antaratmanawith his mind madgatena fixed on me concentrated on me who am vasudeva and sraddhavan with faith becoming filled with faith sah he is m atah considered me by me to be yukta tamah the best of the yogis engaged in yoga most intensely it has been shown thus far that karma yoga has monasticism as its ultimate culmination and in the course of expounding dhyana yoga together299 with its au sxiliaries and instructing about the means to control the mind the lord rules out the possibility of absolute ruin for a person fallen from yoga he has also stated that steadfastness in knowledge is for a man who knows the meaning of the word tvam thou in thou are that all these instructions amount to declaring that liberation comes from the knowledge of the great upanisadic saying thou art that300 chapter 7 71 the blessed lord said o partha hear how you having the mind fixed on me practising the yoga of meditation and taking refuge in me will know me with certainly and in fulness english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swam i gambhirananda 71 o partha mayi asaktamanah having the mind fixed on me one whose mind manah is fixed asakta on me mayi who am the supreme god possessed on the qualification going to be spoken of yogam yunjan practising the yoga of meditati on concentrating the mind madasrayah taking refuge in me one to whom i myself the supreme lord am the refuge asraya is madasrayah anyone who hankers after some human objective resorts to some rite such as the agnihotra etc austerity or charity which is the means to its attainment this yogi however accepts only me as his refuge rejecting any other means he keeps his mind fixed on me alone srnu hear tat that which is being spoken of by me as to yatha how the process by which you who having become thus jnasyasi will know mam301 me asamsayam with certainty without doubt that the lord is such indeed and samagram in fullness possessed of such qualities as greatness strength power majesty etc strength physical power mental etc refers to omniscience and will in their fullness 72 i shall tell you in detail of this knowledge which is combined with realization from the statement jnasyasi you will know in the earlier verse one may conclude that the lord is speak ing of indirect or theoretical knowledge the word idam this rules out such a conclusion and it has also been said that this knowledge is savijnanam combined with direct experienece realization it is consciousness after experience which there remains nothing else here to be known again english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 72 aham i vaksyami shall tell te you asesatah in detail fully of that knowledge about myself which is idam thi s jnanam knowlege which is savijnanam combined with realization associated with personal enlightenment yat jnatva after experiencing which knowledge avasisyate there302

becomes eka bhaktih endowed with one pointed devotion because he finds no one else whom he can adore consequently that person of one pointed devotion visisyate excels becomes superior ie he surpasses the others hi since i the se lf am priyah dear jnaninah to the man of knowledge therefore aham i am atyartham very much priyah dear to him it is indeed a well known fact in the world that the self is dear the meaning therefore is that vasudeva being the self of the man of knowledge is dear to him and sah he the man of knowledge being the very self of me who am vasudeva is very much priyah dear mama to me if that be so then the other three the316 afflicted and the others are not dear to vasudeva this is not so what then 718 all of these indeed are noble but the man of knowledge is the very

matam opinion conviction hi for yukta tma with a steadfast mind having his mind absorbed in the idea i am verily vasudeva the lord and none else that man of knowledge asthitah is set on the path

again 719 at the end of many births the man of knowledge attains me realizing that vasudeva is all such a high souled one is very rare english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary

jnanavan the man of knowledge who has got hiis knowledge matured directly prapadyate attains mam me vasudeva who am the inmost self realizing in what way iti that vasudeva is sarvam all sah such a one who realizes me here ast adds the word narayana tr thus as the self of all is mahatma a high souled one there is none else who can equal or excel him therefore he is su durlabhah very rare among thousands of men as it has been said in verse 3 the reason why one does not realize that all this is verily vasudeva the self is being stated318 720 people deprived of their wisdom by desires for

very kaman desired results tatah there from from that form of the deity which was worshipped as vihitan they are dispensed meted out maya eva by me alone who am the omniscient supreme god because i am possessed of the knowledge of the apportionment of the results of actions the meaning hi s that he surely gets those desired results since they are ordained by god if the reading be hitan instead of hi tan then the beneficence hita means beneficent of the desired result should be interpreted in a figurative sense for desires cannot be beneficial to anyone english translation swami gambhirananda 723 that result of theirs who are of poor intellect is indeed limited the worshippers of gods go to the gods my devotees go to me alone english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda321 723 since those non discriminating men with desires are engaged in disciplines for limited results therefore tat phalam that result tesam of theirs alpamedhasam who are of poor intellect of poor wisdom antavat tu bhavati is limited ephemeral indeed deva yajah the worshippers of gods yanti go devan to the gods madbhaktah my devotees yanti to mam api to me alone thus though the effort needed is the same they do not resort to me alone for the unlimited result alas they are surely in a pitiable condition in this manner the lord expresses his compassion why do they not take refuge in me alone the answer is 724 the unintelligent unaware of my supreme state which is immutable and unsurpassable think of me as the unmanifest that has become manifest english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 724 abuddhayah the unintelligent the non discriminating ones ajanantah unaware mama of my param supreme bhavam state my reality as the

present at present after being embodied as an incarnation though i am the ever well known god they think so because they are unaware of my reality this is the idea what is the reason for their ignorance this is being stated english translation swami gambhirananda 725 being enveloped by yoga maya i do not become manifest to all this deluded world does not know me who am birthless and undecaying english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 725 yoga maya samavrtah being enveloped by yoga maya yoga means the combination the coming together of the three gunas that combination is itself maya yoga maya bein g enveloped ie veiled by that yoga maya aham i na prakasah do not become manifest sarvasya to all to the world the idea is that i become manifest only to some devotees of mine for this very reason ayam this mudhah deluded lokah323 world na abhijanati does not know mam me who am ajam birthless and avyayam undecaying in verse 13 the reason for the non realization of the supreme unqualified brahman was stated the present verse states the reason for the non realization of the qualifi ed brahman that yoga maya because of my being covered by which the world does not know me that yoga maya since it belongs to me does not obstruct the knowlege of me who am god the possessor of maya just as the magic of any other magician does not cover his knowledge since this is so therefore 726 o arjuna i know the past and the present as also the future beings but no one knows me english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 726 o arjuna ah am i however veda know samatitani the past beings and vartamanani the present i know ca also bhavisyani the future bhutani beings tu but na kascana no one veda knows mam me except the one person who is my devotee and has taken refuge in me no one adores me jus because he does not know my reality what againis the obstruction to knowing324 your reality being prevented by which the creatures that are born do not know you in anticipation of such a question the lord says this 727 o scion of the bharata dynasty o destroyer of foes due to the delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes all creatures become bewildered at the time of their birth english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gamb hirananda 727 iccha dvesa samutthena by what arises from likes and dislikes iccha likes and dvesa dislikes are iccha dvesau anything arising from them is icchadvesa samutthah creatures are duluded by that by what when that is thus sought to be known in particular the lord answers dvandva mohena by the delusion of duality delusion moha that originates from duality advandva is dvandva moha those very likes and dislikes which are mutually opposed like heat and cold which relate to hap piness and sorrow and their causes and which come into association with all beings in due course are termed as duality and this deludes all creatures as regards them when likes and dislikes arise from the experience of325 happiness sorrow and their cau ses then by bringing the wisdom of all beings under their control they create bewilderment which is the cause of the impediment to the rise of knowledg about the reality of self the suprem truth indeed exact knowledg about objects even in the externa l world does not arise in one whose mind is overpowered by the defects viz likes and dislikes it goes without saying that knowledge of the indwelling self beset with many obstacles as it is does not arise in a completely bewildered person whose intelli gence has been overcome by them therefore bharata o scion of the bharata dynasty owing to that delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes sarvabhutani all creatures become deluded parantapa o destroyer of foes they yanti sammoham become bewildered come under delusion sarge at the time of their birth ie at the time of their origination the idea is that all creatures that come into being do so prepossessed by delusion since this is so therefore all creatures being deluded and hav ing their wisdom obstructed by that delusion of duality do not know me who am their self hence they do not adore me as their self who again are those that becoming free from the delusion of duality come to know you and adore you as the self in326 accordance with the scriptures in order to elaborate the subject enquired about it is being said english translation swami gambhirananda 728 on the other hand those persons who are of virtuous deeds whose sin has come to

persons tu on the other hand punya karmanam who are of virtuous deeds in whom exist virtuous deeds that are the cause of purification of the mind whose papam sin antagatam has come to an end is almost erad icated attenuated te they dvandva moha nirmuktah being free from the delusion of duality as described and drdhavratah firm in their convictions those who here ast adds sarva parityaga vratena through the vow of relinquishing everything tr h ave the firm knowledge that the supreme reality is such alone and not otherwise are called drdhavratah327 bhajante adore mam me the supreme self why do

knowledge of it as existing in all things on the physical the divine and the sacrificial planes those who realize brhaman as existing in the context of all the five viz of the329 individual of actions

commentary swami gambhirananda 83 aksaram means that which does not perish na ksarati the supreme self this agrees with the upanisadic text under the mighty rule of this immutable o gargi br 389 and the letter om is not accept here as the meaning of aksara lit letter because of its being mentioned as a letter later on in the single letter om which is brahman 13 besides the adjective s upreme is more apporpriate with regard to the absolute immutable brahman by svabhava self hood is meant the eixtence of that very supreme brahman in every body as the indwelling self svabhavah ucyate self hood

supreme brahman visargah the offerings the giving away to gods of things like porridge ca ru an oblations of rice barley and pulse boiled together to be offered to gods cake etc bhuta bhava udbhava karah which bring about the origin of the existence of things is karma sanjnitah meant by action this sacrifice consisting in pouring of oblations is called action the existence bhava of moving and nonmoving things bhuta is bhuta bhava the coming into being udbhava of that existence is bhuta bhava udbhavah that which causes karoti this is bhuta bhava udbhava karah ie the originator of existing

mind and intellect mayi to me esyasi you you who have thus dedicated our mind and intellect to me vasudeva will attain mam eva me alone a s i shall be remembered when the lord instructs arjuna to think of him and at the same time engage in war it may seem that he envisages a combination of knowledge and action but this is not so because when one thinks of all actions accessories and r esults that come within the purview of the mind and the intellect as brahman it is denied that actions etc have any separate reality apart from brahman therefore no combination is involved here besides 88 o

in due course realization of brahman leads to immediate liberation sadyomukti whereas meditation contemplation upasana leads to grad ual liberation krama mukti trhas to be spoken of along with adherence to yoga as also whatever is connected directly or indirectly with it for this purpose the following text is begun 812 having controlled all the passages having confined t he mind in the heart and having fixed his own vital force in the head and then continuing in the firmness in yoga343 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 812 samyamya

yogadharanam the firmness in yoga in order to make it steady and while fixing it there itself 813 he who departs by leaving the body while uttering the single syllable viz om which is brahman and thinking of me he attains the supreme goal english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 813 yah he who prayati departs dies tyajan by leaving deham the body the phrase leaving the body is meant for qualifying departure thereby it344 is implied that the souls departure occurs by abandoning the body and not through the destruction of its own reality having abandoned thus vyaharan while uttering the eka adsaram single syllable om iti brahma viz om which is brahman om which is the name of brahman and anusmaran thinking mam of me of god who is implied by that syllable s ah he yati attains the paramam supreme best gatim goal further 814 o son of prtha to that yogi of constant concentration and single minded attention who remembers me uninterruptedly

uninteruptedly and nityasah for long by satatam uninterrupteldy is meant without any break by niryasah is meant along duration not345 six months nor even a year what then the meaning is he who remembers me for his whole life continuously to that yogi aham i am sulabhah easy of attainment since this is so therefore one should remain ever absorbed in me with mind given to nothing e lse what follows from your being easy of attainment this is being answered hear what follows from my being easy of attainment english translation swami gambhirananda 815 as a result of reaching me the exalted ones who have attained the hi ghest perfection do not get rebirth which is an abode of sorrows and which is impermanent english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 815 upetya mam as a result of reaching me who am god as a result of realiz ing my nature mahatmanah the exalted ones the monks gatah who have attained the paramam highest samsiddhim perfection called liberation na do not apnuvanti get this kind of punarjanama rebirth as to what kind of rebirth they do not get346 the lord states its characteristics duhkhalayam which is an abode of sorrows a resort of physical and other sorrows ie a birth to which sorrows adhere it is not merely an abode of sorrows but also asavatam impermanent having no fixity of nature on the other hand those who do not reach me they come again again is it that those who attain someone other than you return this is being answered english translation swami gambhirananda 816 o arjuna all the worlds together with the world of brahma are subject to return but o son of kunti there is no rebirth after reaching me english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 816 o arjuna all the lokah worlds abrahma bhuvanat together with the wor ld of brahma bhuvana is that place in which creatures are born and brahma bhuvana means the world of brahma punah avartinah are subject to return are by nature liable to come again tu but kaunteya o son of kunti na vidyate there is no punarjan ma rebirth upetya after reaching mam me alone347 why are all the worlds together with the realm of brahma subject to return becuase they are limited by time how 817 those poeple who are knowers of what day and night are know the day of brahma which ends in a thousand yugas the four yugas in the human worlds viz satya treta dwapara and kali are made up of 4320000 years this period multiplied by a thousa nd constitutes one day of brahma his night also extends over an equal period see ms and vsa and his night which ends in a thousand yugas english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 817 viduh they kno w that ahah day brahmanah of brahma of prajapati of virat yat which sahasra yuga paryantam ends in a thousand yugas and also the ratirm night yuga sahasra antam which ends in a thousand yugas having the same duration as the day who knows t hese in reply the lord says te they janah poeple ahoratra vidah who are the knowers of what day and night are ie the people who know the measurement of time since the worlds are thus348 delimited by time therefore they are subject to return what happens during the day and the night of prajapati is being stated 818 with the coming of day all manifested things emerge from the unmanifest and when night comes they merge in that itself which is called the unmanifested english translation of s ri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 818 ahar agame with the coming of day at the time when brahma wakes sarvah vyaktayah all manifested things all things that get manifested all creatures characterized as moving and non moving prabhavanti emerge become manifested avyaktat from the unmanifested avyakta unmanifested is the state of sleep of prajapati from that avyakta similarly ratri agame when night comes at the time when brahma sleeps praliyante they all the manifested things merge tatra eva in that itself avyakta sanjnake which is called the unmanifested referred to above in order to obviate the defect of the emergence of some unmerited result and the destruction of merited results the following verse says that the very349 same multitude of beings continues in the different cycles of creation and there fore these two defects do not arise for pointing out the meaningfulness of the scriptures for the earlier reason the scriptures do not lose their valid ity dealing with bondage and liberation and with a view to propounding detachment from the world on the ground that the helpless multitude of beings perishes after being born again and again under the influence of accumulated results of actions that have for their origin such evils as ignorance etc the five evils are ignorance egoism attachment aversion and clinging to life see p y su 23 the lord says this 819 o son of prtha after being born again and again that very multitude of b eings disappears in spite of itself at the approach of night it comes to life at the approach of day english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 819 o son of prtha bhutva after being born again and again at the approach of day sah eva that very not any other bhutagramah multitude of beings consisting of the moving and the non350 moving objects that existed in the earlier cycle of creation praliyate disappears repeatedly avasah in spinte of itself for they are impelled by their own defects without any independence whatever ratri agame at the approach of night at the close of the day prabhavati it comes to life verily in spite of itself ahar agame at the approach of day the means for the attai nment of that immutable which was introduced has been pointed out in he who departs by leaving the body while uttering the single syllable viz om which is brahman etc 13 now with a vies to indicating the real nature of that very immutable this is being said that it is to be reached through this path of yoga 820 but distinct from that unmanifested is the other eternal unmainfest reality who does not get destroyed when all beings get destroyed english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 820 he is parah distinct different from what tasmat from that aforesaid unmanifested the word tu but is meant for showing the distinction of the immutable that is going to be spoken of from351 the unmani fested he is bhavah the reality the supreme brahman called the immutable even though different there is the possibility of similarlity of characteristics hence for obviating this the lord says anyah the other of a different characteristic and he is the immutable which is beyond the range of the organs it has been said that he is distinct from that from what again is he distinct avyaktat from the unmaifested spoken of earlier which is the seed of the multitude of beings and which is charact erized as ignorance avidya ast adds anyah vilaksanah bhavah ityabhiprayah the meaning is that the reality is different and distinct form that unmanifested tr he is sanatnah eternal bhavah the reality yah sah who is such na does not vin asyati get destroyed when sarvesu bhutesu all beings beginning from brahma nasyatsu get destroyed english translation swami gambhirananda 821 he who has been mentioned as the unmanifested the immutable they call him the supreme goal that is the supreme abode of mine reaching which they do not return352 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 821 he himself who has been uktah meantioned as avyaktah unmanifest the aksarah immutable ahuh they call tam him that very unmanifest reality which is termed as the immutable the paramam supreme gatim goal tat that is the paramam supreme dhama abode ie the supreme state mama of mine of visnu yam prapya reaching which reality na nivartante they do not return to the worldly state the means for gaining that is being stated 822 o son of prtha that supreme person in whom are included all the beings and by whom all this is pervaded is indeed reached through one pointed devotion english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 822 o son of prtha sah that parah purusah supreme unsurpassable person the word purusa derived in the sense of residing in the heart or all pervasiveness that person compared to whom353 there is nothing superior yasya in whom in which person antahsthani are included bhutani all the beings w hich are its products for a product remains inherent in its cause and yena by whom by which person tatam is pervaded sarvam all idam this the universe as pot etc are by space is tu indeed labhyah reached through ananyaya one pointed bhak tya through devotion characterized as knowledge ananyaya which is one pointed which relates to the self the northern path meant for the attainment of braman by the yogis under discussion who have superimposed the idea of brahman on the syllable om a nd who are destined to get liberation in due course has to be stated hence in order to present the intended idea the verse o best of the bharata dynasty of that timeat which etc is being recited the description of the path of return in verse 25 is by way of praising the other path of departure in verse 24 english translation swami gambhirananda 823 o best of the bharata dynasty i shall now speak of that time by departing at which the yogis attain the state of non return and als o of the time354 by departing at which they attain the state of return english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 823 bharatarsabha o best of the bharata dynasty vaksyami i shall speak tu now tam of tha t kalam time prayatah by departing by dying these words are to be which time yoginah the yogis yanti attain anavrttim the state of non return of nonrebirth ca eva and also of the time by departing at which they attain its opposite avrtti m the state of return by yogis are implied both the yogis men of meditation and the men of acitons rites and duties but the men of action are yogis by courtesy in accordance with the description through the yoga of action for the yogis 33 the lord speaks of that time this is asts reading tr 824 fire light daytime the birght forrnight the six months of the northern solstice by following this path persons who are knowers of brahman attain brahman when they die355 english trans lation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 824 agnih fire is a deity presiding over a period of time similarly jyotih light also is a deity presiding over a period of time or fire and light are the well known vedic deit ies as the expression mango grove is used with regard to a place where mango trees are more numerous similarly the expressions at which time and that time in the earlier verse are used in view of the predominance of the deities presiding over t ime if the first two fire and light are taken as vedic deities then the remaining three are the only deities of time still the latter being numerically greater all the five deities are referred to as deities of time the deities of both the paths of gods and manes or of the northern and the southern paths as they are called who are gods of time are referred to here as time by such words as day fortnight six months etc so also ahah daytime means the deity of daytime suklah the bright fortnight implies the deity presiding over the bright fortnight sanmasah uttarayanam the six months of the northern solstice here too is understood the deity presiding over the path this is the principle of interpretation followed356 elsewhere in the u panisads also tatra following this path janah persons who are brahma vidah knowers of brahman those engaged in meditation on the qualified brahman gacchanti attain brahma brahman prayatah when they die it is understood that they attain bra hman through stages indeed according to the upanisadic text his vital forces do not depart br 4446 there is neither going nor coming back for those established in full realization who are fit for immediate liberation having their organs merged in brahman they are suffused with brahman they are verily identified with brahman english translation swami gambhirananda 825 smoke night as also the dark fortnight and the six months of the southern solstice following this path the yogi having reached the lunar light returns english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 825 d human smoke and ratrih night are the deities presiding over smoke and night similarly357 krsnah the dark fornight means the deity of the dark fortnight just as before by sanmasah daksinayanam the six months of the southern solstice also is verily me ant a deity tatra following this path yogi the yogi who performs sacrifices etc the man of actions prapya having reached candramasam jyotih the lunar light having enjoyed the results of his actions nivartate returns on their exhaustion english translation swami gambhirananda 826 these two courses of the world which are white and black are verily considered eternal by the one a man goes to the state of non return by the other he returns again english translation of sri sankara charyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 826 ete these two gati courses jagatah of the world which are sukla krsne white and black the northern path the path of the gods and the southern path the path of the manes respectively white because it is a revealer of knowlege and black because there is absence of that revelation are hi verily mate considered358 sasvate eternal because the world is eternal these two courses are possible for those who are qualified for knowledge a nd for rites and duties not for everybody this being so ekaya by the one by the white one yati a man goes anavrttim to the state of non return anyaya by the other avartate he returns punah again english translation swami gambhirananda 827 o son of prtha no yogi one steadfast in meditation whosoever has known these two courses becomes deluded therefore o arjuna be you steadfast in yoga at all times english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambh irananda 827 o son of prtha na kascana yogi no yogi whosoever janan has known ete srti these two courses as described that one leads to worldly life and the other to liberation muhyati becomes deluded tasmat therefore o arjuna bhava be you yoga yuktah steadfast in yoga sarvesu kalesu at all times here about the greatness of that yoga359 english translation swami gambhirananda 828 having known this the yogi transcends all those results of rigtheous deeds that are declared with reg ard to the vedas sacrifices austerities and also charities and he reaches the primordial supreme state english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 828 viditva having known idam this having fully ascertained and practised what was spoken in the course of determining the answers to the seven questions put by arjuna in verse 1 and 2 the yogi atyeti transcends goes beyond tat sarvam all those punya phalam results of righteous deeds aggregate of rewards yat that are pradistam declared by the scriptures with regard to theseviz vedesu with regard to teh vedas which have been properly sitting facing eastward after having washed ones han ds face etc studied yajnesu with regard to sacrifices performed together with their accessories tapahsu with regard to austerities practised correctly with concentrated mind intellect etc ca eva and also danesu with regard to charities rig htly taking into360 consideration place time and fitness of the recipient given and upaiti he reaches the param supreme sthanam state of god adyam which is primordial the cause that existed in the beginning ie brahman361 chapter 9 english translation swami gambhirananda 91 the blessed lord said however to you who are not given to cavilling i shall speak of this highest secret itself which is knowledge jnana may mean brahman that is consciousness or its knowledge gathered from the vedas paroksa jnana vijnana is direct experience aparoksa jnana combined with experience by realizing which you shall be free from evil english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 91 te to you anasuyave who are not given to cavillin g who are free from carping pravaksyami i shall speak of idam this the lord uttered the word this by bearing in mind as an immediately present fact the knowledge of brahman that will be and was spoken of in the earlier chapters the word tu howeve r is used for pointing out a distinction the distinction of knowledge from meditation that was being discussed i shall speak of this itself what is that it is guhyatamam the highest secret and is jnanam362 knowledge complete knowledge nothing el se the direct means to liberation as stated in the upanisads and the smrtis vasudeva is all 719 the self verily is all this ch 7252 one only without a second op cit 621 etc and also as stated in such upanisadic texts as on t he other hand those who understand otherwise than this come under a different ruler and belong to the worlds that are subject to decay op cit 7252 knowledge of what kind it is vijnana sahitam combined with experience jnatva by realizing by attaining yat which knowledge moksyase you shall be free asubhat from evil from worldly bondage english translation swami gambhirananda 92 this is the sovereign knowledge the sovereign profundity the best sanctifire directly realizable righteous very easy to practise and imperishable english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 92 and that is raja vidya the sovereign knowledge the kind among sciences because of the abundance of its radia nce indeed this363 knowledge of brahman shines most brilliantly among all kiinds of learning the word raja means a king or figuratively the greatest or derived from the root raj to shine it may mean shining tr so also idam this is raja guhyam the sovereign profundity the kind among profundities uttamam the best pavitram sanctifier this knowledge of brahman which sanctifies all things that purify is the greatest shine it reduces to ashes in a moment the results of all actions righteou s unrighteous and others together with their roots accumulated over many thousands of births therefore what to speak of its sanctifying power besides it is pratyaksavagamam directly realizable directly perceivable like happiness etc even though possessed of many qualities a thing may be noticed to be contrary to righteousness the knowledge of the self is not opposed to righteousness in that way but it is dharmyam righteous not divorced from righteousness eeve so it may be difficult to pract ice hence the lord says it is susukham very easy kartum to practise like the knowledge of the distinction among jewels it is seen in the world that actions which require little effort and are accomplished easily yield meagre results whereas those that are difficult to364 accomplish yield great results thus the contingency arises that this knowledge of brahman however which is easily attained perishes when its result gets exhausted therefore the lord says it is avyayam imperishable from the po int of view of its result it is not perishable like the results of actions hence the knowledge of the self should be highly regarded 93 o destroyer of foes persons who are regardless of this dharma knowledge of the self certainly go round and round without reaching me along the path of transmigration which is fraught with death english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 93 parantapa o destroyer of foes those purusah persons again who are as raddadhanah regardless of devoid of faith in asya dharmasya this dharma this knowledge of the self those who are faithless as regards its true nature as well as its result who are sinful who have taken recourse to the upanisad mystical teaching of demoniacal people consisting in consideration the body alone as the self and who delight in life sense enjoyments nivartante certainly go round and365 round where mrtyu samsara vartmani along the path vartma of transmigration samsara fraught with death mrtyu the path leading to hell birth as low creatures etc ie they go round and round along that very path aprapya without reaching mam me the supreme god certainly there is no question of their attaining me hence the implication is that they go round and round without even acquiring a little devotion which is one of the disciplines ast omits the word sadhana disciplines tr constituting the path for reaching me having drawn arjunas attention through the above eulogy the lord says english translation swami gambhirananda 94 this whole world is prevaded by me in my unmanifest form all beings exist in me but i am not contained in them english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami ga mbhirananda 94 idam this sarvam whole jagat world is tatam pervaded maya by me through the supreme nature that i have avyakta murtina in my unmanifest form in that form in which my366 nature is not manifest ie in my form which is beyond th e range of the organs sarva bhutani all beings from brahma to a clump of grass matsthani exist in me are established in me in that unmanifest form for no created thing that is bereft of the self ie of reality can be conceived of as an object of practical use therefore being possessed of their reality through me who am their self they exist in me hence they are said to be established in me i myself am the self of those created things consequently it appears to people of little understandin g that i dwell in them hence i say na ca aham but i am not avasthitah contained tesu in them in the created things since unlike gross objects i am not in contact with anything therefore i am certainly the inmost core even of space for a thing t hat has no contact with anything cannot exist like something contained in a receptacle for this very reason that i am not in contact with anyting english translation swami gambhirananda 95 nor do the beings dwell in me behod my divine yoga i am the sustainer and originator of beings but my self is not contained in the beings367 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 95 na ca bhutani no r do the beings beginning from brahma matsthani dwell in me pasya behold me my aisvaram divine yogam yoga action performance ie this real nature of myself the upanisadic text too similarly shows the absence of association of the self d ue to its being free from contact unattached for it is never attached br 3926 behold this other wonder i am the bhuta bhrt sustainer of beings though i am unattached ca but mama atma my self na bhutasthah is not contained in the bengs as it has been explained according to the logic stated above there is no possibility of its remaining contained in beings how again is it said it is my self following human understanding having separated the aggregate of body etc from the self and superimposing eoism of them the lord calls it my self but not that he has said so by ignorantly thinking like ordinary mortals that the self is different from himself so also i am the bhuta bhavanah originator of beings one who gives birth to or nourishes the beings by way of establishing with the help of an illustration the subject matter subject matter that the self which368 has no contact with anything is the substratum of creation continuance and dissolution dealt with in the aforesaid two verses the lord says english translation swami gambhirananda 96 understand thus that just as the voluminous wind moving everywhere is ever present in space similarly all beings abide in me english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskr it commentary swami gambhirananda 96 upadharaya understand iti thus that yatha just as in the world the mahan voluminous in dimension vayuh wind sarvatragah moving everywhere is nityam ever during creation continuance and dissolution akasa sthitah present in space tatha similarly sarvani all bhutani beings matsthani abide in me who am omnipresent like space abide certainly without any contact english translation swami gambhirananda369 97 o son kunti all the beings g o back at the end of a cycle to my prakrti i project them forth again at the beginning of a cycle english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 97 kaunteya o son of kunti sarva bhutani all the beings all the beings which like wind abiding in space abide thus in me during their period of existence yanti go back kalpa ksaye at the end of a cycle at the time of dissolution mamikam prakrtim to my prakrti which consists of the three gunas qualities see 713 and is called my lower nature punah again aham i visrjami project forth create tani them the beings as before as before as in previous cycles of creation kalpadau at the beginning of a cycle at the time of creation english tr anslation swami gambhirananda 98 keeping my own prakrti under control i project forth again and again the whole of this multitude of beings which are powerless owing to the influence of their own nature370 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 98 thus avastabhya keeping under control svam my own prakrtim prakrti which is charcterized as nescience visrjami i project forth punah punah again and again the krtsnam whole of imam this existing bhuta gramam multitude of beings which are born of prakrti which being under anothers sub jugation due to such defects see under 819 introductory commentary tr as ignorance etc are avasam powerless not independent prakrteh vasat under the influence of their own nature in that case you who are the supreme god and who ordain this multitude of beings unequally will become associated with virtue and vice as a result of that act in aswer the lord says this english translation swami gambhirananda 99 o dhananjaya arjuna nor do those actions bind me remaining as i do like one unconcerned with and unattached to those actions371 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 99 o dhananjaya na ca nor do tani those karmani actions which are the sources of the creation of the multitude of beings unequally nibadhnanti bind mam me who am god as to that the lord states the reason for his not becoming associated with the actions asinam remaining as i do udasinavat like one unconcerned like some indifferent spectator for the self is not subject to any change and asaktam unattached tesu karmasu to those actions free from attac hment to results free from the egoism that i do hence even int he case of any other person also the absence of the idea of agentship and the absence of attachment to results are the causes of not getting bound otherwise like the silkworm a foolish man becomes bound by acitons this is the idea there in th previous two verses it involves a contradiction to say remaining like one unconcerned i project forth this multitude of beings in order to dispel this doubt the lord says english tran slation swami gambhirananda372 910 under me as the supervisor the prakrti produces the world of the moving and the non moving things owing to this reason o son of kunti the world revolves english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit comme ntary swami gambhirananda 910 maya under me adhyaksena as the supervisor remaining changeless as a mere witness under all circumstances prakrtih the prakrti my maya consisting of the three gunas and characterized as ignorance suyate produces the world sa caraacaram of the

devotees this is true he does arrange for it but the difference lies in this others who are devotees make their own efforts as well for their own sake to arrange for securing what they lack and protecting what they have on the contrary th ose who have realized non duality do not make any effrot to arrange for themselves the acquisition of what they do not have and the preservation of what they have indeed they desire nothing for themselves in life or in death they have taken refuge only in the lord therefore the lord himself arranges to procure what they do not have and protect what they have got if you yourself are the other gods even then do not their devotees too worship you alone quite so 923 even those who being devot ed to other deities and endowed with faith worship them

the wrong method avidhi implies ignorance so the idea is that they worship me ignorantly how it is that they worship me ignorantly ie the worshippers of other deities worship them knowingly and hence how can the question of their igno rance arise this is being answered because english translation swami gambhirananda 924 i indeed am the enjoyer as also the lord of all sacrifices but they do not know me in reality therefore they fall388 english translation of sri sankarach aryas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 924 as the self of the deities of the sacrifices aham i hi indeed am the

therefore by worshipping ignorantly te they cyavanti fall from the result of the sacrifice although they perform sacrifices with great diligence still just because they do not know me real nature and do not offer the fruits of their sacrifices to me they proceed to the worlds of the respective deities through the southern path beginning with smoke see 825 then after the exhaustion of the results of those sacrifices and the falling of the res pective bodies assumed in those worlds they return to the human world for rembodiment ms see also 920 1 the result of a sacrifice is inevitable even for

1134 by saying who have bee n killed by me the lord names drona and those very warriors with regard to whom arjuna had his doubts now then uncertainty with regard to drona and bhisma is well founded drona was the teacher of the science of archery and was equipped with heavenl y weapons and particularly he was his arjunas own teacher and most respected bhisma was destined to die at will and possessed heavenly weapons he fought a duel with parasurama and remained unvanquished so also jayadratha whose father was performin g an austerity with the idea that anyone who made his sons head fall on the ground would have even his own head fall since karna also was equipped with an unerring spear given by indra and was a son of the sun born of a maiden kunti therefore he is referred to by his

throat becomes choked with phlegm and his eyes full of tears when on being struck with fear he is overcome by sorrow and when on being overwhelmed with affection he is filled with joy the

act of uttera nce pranamya bowing down with humility bhita bhitah overcome by fits of fear with his mind struck again and again with fear this is to be connected with the remote word aha said at this juncture the words of sanjaya have a purpose in view how it is thus thinking that the helpless duryodhana will be as459 good as dead when the four unconquerable ones viz drona and others are killed dhrtarastra losing hope of victory would conclude a treaty from that will follow peace on either side under the i nfluence of fate dhrtarastra did not even listen to that 1136 arjuna said it is proper

reciting your greatness and hearing it this is befitting this is the idea or the word sthane may be taken as qualifying the word subject understood it is proper that the lord is the subject of joy etc since the lord is the self of all beings and the friend of all so also it the world anurajyate becomes attracted becomes drawn by that praise that also is with regard to a proper subject this is how460 it is to be explained further that the raksamsi raksasas bhitani stricken with fear dravanti run disah in all directions that also is with regard to a proper subject and that sarve all the siddha sanghah groups of the siddhas kapila and others namasyanti bow down that also is befitting he points out the reason for the lords being the object of delight etc 1137 and why should they not

being and non being but in reality that immutable is transc endental to being and non being that immutable which the knowers of the vedas declare 811 cf ka 1215 that is you yourself nothing else this

work for his master but does not accept the master a s his own supreme goal to be attained after death his one however who does work for me accepts me alone as the supreme goal thus he is matparamah one to whom i am the supreme goal so also he who is madbhaktah devoted to me he adores me alone in al l ways with his whole being and full enthusiasm thus he is madbhaktah sanga varjitah who is devoid of attachment for wealth sons friends wife and relatives sanga means fondness love devoid of them nirvairah who is free from enmity sarva bhut esu towards all beings berefit of the idea of enmity even towards those engaged in doing unmost harm to him sah he who is such a devotee of mine eti attains mam me i alone am his supreme goal he does not attain any other478 goal this is the advice for you given by me as desired by you479 chapter 12 121 arjuna said those devotees who being thus ever dedicated meditate on you and those again who meditate on the immutable the unmanifested of them who are the best experiencers of yoga here yoga means samadhi spiritual absorption engl ish translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 121 the subject matter stated in the immediately preceding verse he who works for me etc is referred to by the word evam thus ye bhaktah those devotees who see king no other refuge evam thus satata yuktah being ever devoted ie remaining unceasingly engaged in the works of the lord etc intent on the aforesaid purpose paryupasate meditate tvam on you in the cosmic form as revealed earlier ye ca api and those others again who have renounced all desires who have given up all actions who meditate on brahman as described below aksaram on the immutable avyaktam on the unmanifested which is so on account of being bereft of all limiting adjunct s and which is480 beyond the comprehension of the organs in the world whatever comes within the range of the organs is said to be manifest for the root anj conveys that sense but this immutable is the opposite of that and is endowed with qualifications that are spoken of by the great ones those again who meditate on that tesam of them among the two groups ke who are the yoga vittamah best experiencers of yoga ie who are those that are surpassingly versed in yoga but leave alone those who meditate on the immutable who are fully enlightened and are free from desires whatever has to be said with regard to them we shall say later on as for those others 122 the blessed lord said those who meditate on me by fixing their minds on m e with steadfast devotion and being endowed with supreme faith they are considered to be the most perfect yogis according to me english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 122 ye those who being devotees upasate meditate mam on me the supreme lord of all the masters of yoga the omniscient one whose vision481 is free from purblindness caused by such defects as attachment etc avesyaby fixing concentrating their manah minds mayi on me on god in his cosmic form nitya yuktah with steadfast devotion by being ever dedicated in accordance with the idea expressed in the last verse of the preceding chapter and being upetah endowed paraya with supreme sraddhaya faith te they matah are considered to be yukta tamah most perfect yogis me according to me for they spend days and nights with their minds constantly fixed on me therefore it is proper to say with regard to them that they are the best yogis is it that the others do not become the best yogis no but listen to what has to be said as regards them 123 those however who meditate in every way on the immutable the indefinable the unmanifest which is all pervading incomprehensible change less immovable and constant english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 123 ye those tu however who pari upasate meditate in every way aksaram on the immutable anirdesyam the indefinable being unmanifest it is482 beyond the range of wo rds and hence cannot be defined avyaktam the unmanifest it is not comprehensible thrugh any means of knowledge upasana meditation means approaching an object of meditation as presented by the scriptures and making it an object of ones own thought a nd dwelling on it uniterruptedly for long by continuing the same current of thought with regard to it like a line of pouring oil this is what is called upasana the lord states the characteristics of the immutable here ast adds upasyasya which is the object of meditation tr sarvatragam all pervading pervasive like space and acintyam incomprehensible becuase of its being unmanifest for whatever comes within the range of the organs can be thought of by the mind also being opposed to that th e immutable is inconceivable it is kutastham changeless kuta means something apparently good but evil inside the word kuta deceptive is well known in the world in such phrases as kuta rupam deceptive in appearance kuta saksyam false evidence etc thus kuta is that which as ignorance etc is the seed of many births full of evil within referred to by such words as maya the undifferentiated etc and well known from such texts as one should know maya to be nature but the lord of maya to483 be the supreme god sv 410 the divine maya of mine is difficult to cross over 714 etc that which exists on that kuta as its controller or witness is the kuta stha or kutastha may mean that which exists like a heap that is motionless hence it is acalam immovable since it is immovable therefore it is dhruvam constant ie eternal 124 by fully controlling all the organs and always being even minded they engaged in the welfare of all beings attain me alone english transl ation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 124 samniyamya by fully controlling withdrawing indriya gramam all the organs and sarvatra always at all times sama buddhayah being even minded the even minded are those whos e minds remain equipoised in getting anything desirable or undesirable te they those who are of this kind ratah engaged sarva bhuta hite in the welfare of all beings prapnuvanti attain mam me eva alone as regards them it needs no saying that t hey attain me for it has been said but the man of knowledge is the very self484 this is my opinion 718 it is certainly not proper to speak of being or not being the best among the yogis with regard to those who have attained identity with the lo rd but 125 for them who have their minds attached to the unmanifested the struggle is greater for the goal which is the unmanifest is attained with difficulty by the embodied ones english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 125 tesam for them avyakta asakta cetasam who have their minds attached to the unmanifest klesahthe struggle is adhika tarah greater although the trouble is cer tainly great for those who are engaged in works etc for me still owing to the need of giving up self identification with the body it is greater in the case of those who accept the immutable as the self and who kept in view the supreme reality hi for avyakta gatih the goal which is the unmanifest the goal which stands in the form of the immutable that is avapyate attained duhkham with difficulty dehavadbhih by the embodied ones by those who identify themselves with the body hence the struggl e is485 greater we shall speak later of the conduct of those who meditate on the unmanifest 126 as for those who having dedicated all actions to me and accepted me as the supreme meditate by thinking of me with single minded concentration only english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 126 tu as for ye those who sannyasya having dedicated sarvani all karmani actions mayi to me who am god and matparah having accepted me as the supreme upasa te meditate dhyayantah by thinking mam of me ananyena with single minded yogena concentration eva only that yoga is single minded which has no other object than the cosmic deity the self by thinking exclusively with that single minded the ast and the aa read kena what in place of kevalena exclusively

absorbed in fixed on merg ed in me who am the cosmic person aham i god bhavami become na cirat without delay what then soon indeed the samuddharta deliverer wherefrom in answer the lord says mrtyu samsara sagarat from the sea of the world which is fraught with death samsara world fraught with mrtyu death is mrtyu samsara that itself is like a sea being difficult to cross i become their deliverer from that sea of transmigration which is fraught with death since this is so therefore 128 fix the mind on m e alone in me alone rest the intellect there is no doubt that hereafter you will dwell in me alone for the sake of metre eva and atah in the second line of the verse are not joined together to form evatah english translation of sri sankarachar yas sanskrit commentary swami

after the fall of the body nivasisyasi you will dwell mayi in me live in identity withme eva alone 129 if however you are unable to establish the mind steadily on me then o dhananjaya seek to attain me through the yoga of practice english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 129 atha if however na saknosi you are unable samadhatum to establish in this way as i have described cittam the mind sthiram steadily unwaveringly mayi on me tatah then o dhananjaya iccha seek pray aptum to attain mam me as the c osmic person abhyasa yogena through the yoga of practice practice consists in488 repeatedly fixing the mind on a single object by withdrawing it from everything else the yoga following from this and consisting in concentration of the mind is abhyasa yoga 1210 if you are unable even to practise be intent on works for me by undertaking works for me as well you will attain perfection identity with brahman english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1210 if asamarthah asi you are unable api even abhyase to practise then bhava be mat karma paramah intent on works for me works karma meant for me mat are mat karma ie you be such that works meant for me become most important to you in the absence of practice api even kurvan by undertaking karmani works alone madartham for me avapsyasi you will attain siddhim perfection by gradually acquiring purification of mind concentration and knowledge 1211 if you are unable to do even this in that case having resorted to the yoga for me thereafter489 renounce the results of all works by becoming controlled in mind english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1211 atha if again asaktah asi you are unable kartum to do etat api even this what was stated as being intent on doing works for me in that case mad yogam asritah having resorted to the yoga for me the performance of those works that are being done by dedicating them to me is madyogah by resorting to that yoga for me tatah thereafter sarva karma phala tyagam kuru renounce give up the results of all works by becoming yata atmavan controlled in mind in the earlier verse it was enjoined that all works be they vedic or secular are to be considered as belonging to god and should be done for him not for oneself as a soldier would do for his king in the present verse it is stated that the attitude should be may this work of mine please god this very attitude involv es dedicating of results to god see s according to ms mat karma in the earlier verse means bhagavata dharma ie hearing singing etc about god in the present verse sarva karma means all works in general tr490 now the lord praises the renunciatio n of the results of all works 1212 knowledge is surely superior to practice meditation surpasses knowledge the renunciation of the results of works excels meditation from renunciation peace follows immediately english translation of sri sank aracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1212 jnanam knowledge firm conviction about the self arrived at through vedic texts and reasoning is hi surely sreyah superior to what abhyasat to practice practice repeated effort to as certain the true meaning of vedic texts in order to acquire knowledge which is not preceded by discrimination dhyanam meditation undertaken along with knowledge visisyate surpasses even jnanat that knowledge karma phala tyagah renunciation of th e results of works excels even dhyanat meditation associated with knowledge excels has to be supplied tyagat from this renunciation of the results of actions in the way described before by dedicating all actions to god with the idea may god b e pleased santih peace the cessation of transmigratory491 existence together with its cause follows anantaram immediately not that it awaits another accasion should the unenlightened person engaged in works be unable to practise the disciplines enjoi ned earlier then for him has been enjoined renunciation of the results of all works as a means to liberation but this has not been done at the very beginning and for this reason renunciation of the results of all works has been praised in knowledge i s surely superior to practice etc by teaching about the successive excellence for it has been taught as being fit to be adopted by one in case he is unable to practise the disciplines already presented presented from verse 3 onwards objection from what similarly does the eulogy follow reply in the verse when all desires clinging to ones heart fall off ka 2314 it has been stated that immortality results from the rejection of all desires that is well known and all desires means the re sult of all rites and duties enjoined in the vedas and smrtis from the renunciation of these peace surely comes immediately to the enlightened man who is steadfast in knowledge there is a similarity between renunciation of all desires and renunciation of the results of actions by an unenlightened person hence on account of that492 similarity this eulogy of renunciation of the results of all actions is meant for rousing interest as for instance by saying that the sea was drunk up by the brahmana agastya the brahmanas of the present day are also praised owing to the similarity of brahminhood in this way it was been said that karma yoga becomes a means for liberationsince it involves renunciaton of the rewards of works here again the yoga consisting in the concentration of mind on god as the cosmic person as also the performance of actions etc for god have been spoken of by assuming a difference between god and self in if you are unable to do even this 11 since it has been hinted that it kar mayoga is an effect of ignorance therefore the lord is pointing out that karma yoga is not suitable for the meditator on the immutable who is aware of idenity of the self with god the lord is similarly pointing out the impossibility of a karma yogin s meditation on the immutable in the verse theyattain me alone 4 having declared that those who meditate on the immutable are independent so far as the attainment of liberation is concerned the lord has shown in i become the deliverer 7 that others have no independence they are dependent on god for if they the former be considered to have493 become identified with god they would be the same as the immutable on account of their having realized non difference consequently speakin g of them as objects of the act of deliverance will become inappropriate and since the lord in surely the greatest well wisher of arjuna he imparts instructions only about karma yoga which involves perception of duality and is not associated with full illumination also no one who has realized his self as god through valid means of knowledge would like subordination to another since it involves a contradiction therefore with the idea i shall speak of the group of virtues as stated in he hwo is not hateful towards any creature etc which are the direct means to immortality to those monks who meditate on the immutablewho are steadfast in full enlightenment and have given up all desires the lord proceeds 1213 he who is not hateful towa rds any creature who is friendly and compassionate who has no idea of mine and the idea of egoism who is the same under sorrow and happiness who is forgiving english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda494 1213 advesta he who is not hateful sarva bhutanam towards any creature he does not feel repulsion for anything even for what may be the cause of sorrow to himself for he sees all beings as his own self maitrah he who is friendly behaving like a frie nd karunah

nirahankarah who has no idea of egoism sama duhkha sukhah who is the same under sorrow and happiness he in whom sorrow and happiness do not arouse any repulsion or attraction ksami who is forgiving who remains unperturbed even when abused or assaulted 1214 he who is ever co ntent who is a yogi who has self control who has firm conviction who has dedicated his mind and intellect to me he who is

nor food as said in another smrti sthira matih steady minded whose thought is steady with regard to the reality which is the supreme goal and bhakti man who is full of devotion he is dear to me there is a repeated mention of bhakti in this chapter because it is means to the knowledge which leads to the supreme goal the group of qualities of the monks who meditate on the immutable who have renou nced all desires who are steadfast in the knowledge of the supreme goal which qualities are under discussion beginning from he who is not hateful towards any creature 13 is being concluded500 1220 but tu but is used to distinguish those who have attained the highest goal from the aspirants tr those devotees who accept me as the supreme goal and with faith seek for this ambrosia mss reading is dharmamrtam nectar in the form of virtue virtue is called nectar because it leads to immortal ity or because it is sweet like nectar which is indistinguishable from the virtues as stated above they are very dear to me english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1220 tu but ye bhaktah those devot ees of mine the monks who have resorted to the highest devotion consisting in the knowledge of the supreme reality mat paramah who accept me as the supreme goal to whom i as mentioned above who am identical with the immutable am the highest parama unsurpassable goal and sraddadhanah with faith paryupasate seek for practise idam this dharmyamrtam ambrosia that is indistinguishable from the virtues that which is indistinguishable from dharma virtue is dharmya and this is called amrta am brosia since it leads to immortality yatha uktam as stated501 above in he who is not hateful towards any creature etc te they are ativa very priyah dear me to me after having explained what was hinted in for i am very much dear to the man of knowledge717 that has been concluded here in those devotees are very dear to me since by seeking for this ambrosia which is indistinguishable from the virtues as stated above one becomes very dear to me who am thelord vishnu the supreme go d therefore this nectar which is indistinguishable from the virtues has to be diligently sought for by one who is a seeker of liberation who wants to attain the coveted abode of visnu this is the purport of the sentence thus after the consummation of meditation on the qualified brahman one who aspires after the unqualified brahman who has the qualifications mentioned in he who is not hateful towards any creature etc who is pre eminently fit for this purpose and who practises sravana etc has the possibility of realizing the truth from which his liberation logically follows hence the conclusion is that the meaning of the word tat in the sentence tattvamasi has to be sought for since his has the power to arouse the comprehension of the mean ing of that sentence which is the means to liberation502 chapter 13 131 swami gambhirananda has not translated this sloka many editions of the bhagavadgita do not contain this sloka including the commentary by sankaracharya if this sloka is included the total number of slokas in the bhagavadgita is 701 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 131 sri sankaracharya did not comment on this sloka many editions of the bhagavadgita do not contain this sl oka if this sloka is included the total number of slokas in the bhagavadgita is 701 132 the blessed lord said o son of kunti this body is referred to as the field those who are versed in this call him who is conscious of it as the knower o f the field english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 132 the lord specifies the body as the object referred to by the pronoun idam this o son of kunti this body abhidhiyate is referred to503 ksetram i ti as the field because it is protected tra against injury ksata or because it perishes ksi wastes away ksar or because the results of actions get fulfilled in the body as in a field ksetra the word iti is used in the sense of as they who tadvidah who are versed in this who know the field and the knower of the field ahuh call tam him the knower yah who vetti etat is concious of knows it the body the field makes it from head to foot an abject of his knowledge makes it an object of perception as a separate entity through knowledg which is spontaneous or is acquired through instruction ksetrajna iti as the knower of the field as before the word iti is used in the sense of as they call him as the knower of the fie ld is it that the field and the knower of the field thus mentioned are to be understood through this much knowledge only the answer is no 133 and o scion of the bharata dynasty under stand me to be the knower of the field in all the fields in my opinion that is knowledge which is the knowlege of th field and the knower of the field english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda504 133 ca api and viddhi understand mam me the supreme god who is transcendental to be the ksetrajnam knower of the field with the characterisitics noted above sarva ksetresu in all the fields the idea is this know the knower of the field who has become diversified by limiting adjuncts in the form of numerous fields ranging from brahma to a clump of grass as free from differentiations resulting from all the limiting adjuncts and as beyond the range of such words and ideas as existece none xistence etc o scion of the bharata dynasty since there remains nothing to be known apart from the true nature of the field the knower of the field and god therefore tat that is jnanam knowledge right knowledge yat which is the jnanam knowled ge ksetra ksetrajnayoh of the field and the knower of the field which are the two knowables and by which knowledge the field and the knower of the field are made objects of knowledge this is mama my god vishus matam opinion objection well if i t be that in all the field there exists god alone and none else other than him as the enjoyer then god will become a mundane being or due to the absence of any mundane creature other than god there will arise the contingency of the negation of505 mundan ce existence and both these are undesirable since the scriptures dealing with bondage liberation and their causes will become useless and also becuase they contradict such valid means of knowledge as direct perception in the first place mundane exist ence which is characterized by happiness sorrow and their cause is apprehended through direct perception besides from the perception of variety in the world it can be inferred that mundane existence results from virtue and vice all this becomes illogic al if god and the individual soul be one reply no because this becomes justifiable owing to the difference between knowledge and ignorance these two viz that which is know as knowledge and that which is known as ignorance are widely contradictory and they follow divergent courses ka 124 and similarly the different results viz liberation and enjoyment belonging respectively to those knowledge and ignorance have also been pointed out to be contrary by saying that liberation is the goal of knowledge and enjoyment is the result of ignorance see ka 122 vyasa also has said so now there are these two paths mbh sa 2416 etc and there are only these two paths etc here in the gita also two kinds of steadfastness have been s tated and it is understood from the vedas506 the smrtis and reason that ignorance together with its effects has to be destroyed by knowledge as for the vedic texts they are if one has realized here then there is truth if he has not realized here then there is great destruction ke 25 knowing him in this way one becomes immortal here nr pu 6 there is no other path to go by sv 38 the enlightened man is not afraid of anything tai 291 on the other hand the texts with regard to the unenlightened person are then he is smitten with fear tai 271 living in the midst of ognorance ka 125 one who knows brahman becomes brahman indeed in his line is not born anyone who does not know brahman mu 329 while he w ho worships another god thinking he is one and i am another does not know he is like an animal to the gods br 1410 he who is a knower of the self he becomes all this universe br 1410 when men will fold up space like folding leat her then there will be cessation of sorrow without knowing the deity sv 69 there are thousands of texts like these and the smrti texts from the gita are knowledge remains covered by ignorance thereby the creatures become deluded 515 h ere itself is rebirth conquered by them whose minds are established on sameness 519 since by seeing equally the507 god who is present alike everywhere he does not injure the self by the self therefore he attains the supreme goal 1328 etc and as for reason there is the text men avoid snakes tips of kusa grass as also well when they are aware of them some fall into them owing to ignorance thus see the special result arising from knowledge mbh sa 20117 similarly it is known that an u nelightened person who identifies himself with the body etc and who practises righteousness and unrighteousness under the impulsion of attachment and aversion takes birth and dies it cannot be reasonably denied by anyone that those who see the self as different from the body etc become liberated as a result of the cessation of righteous and unrighteous conduct which depends on the destruction of attachment and aversion the being so the knower of the field who is reality is god himself appears to have become a mundane soul owing to the various adjuncts which are products of ignorance as for instance the individual soul becomes identified with the body etc for it is a well known fact in the case of all creatures that their self identify with the b ody etc which are not self is definitely caused by ignorance just as when a stump of a tree is firmly regarded as a man the qualities of a man do not thereby come to exist in508 the stump nor do the qualities of the stump come to the person similarly t he property ofconsciousness does not come to the body nor those of the body to consciousness it is not proper that the self should be identified with happiness sorrow delusion etc since they like decrepitude and death are equally the products of i gnorance objection may it not be said that this is not so becuase of dissimilarity the stump and the man which are verily objects of perception are superimposed on each other through ignorance by their perceiver on the other hand in the case of the body and the self the mutual superimposition occurs verily between a knower and an object of perception thus the illustration is not equally applicable therefore may it not be that the properties of the body though objects of knowledge belong to t he self which is the knower reply no since there arises the contingency of the self becoming devoid of consciousness if qualities such as happiness sorrow delusion desire etc of the body etc which are the field and are objects of knowledge in deed belong to the knower then it will be necessary to explain the particular reason why some of the qualities of the object of knowledge the field superimposed through ignorance belong to the self while509 decrepitude death etc do not on the contrary it is possible to infer that they happiness etc do not pertain to the self since like decrepitude etc they are superimposed on the self through ignorance and because they are either avoidable or acceptable this being so the mundane state consis ting of agentship and enjoyership pertaining to the objects of knowledge is superimposed on the knower through ignorance hence nothing of the knower is affected thereby in the same way as nothing of the sky is affected by the superimposition of surface diret etc on it by fools such being the case not the least touch of the mundane state is to be apprehended with regard to the almighty see footnote on p5 and p168 god the knower of the field even though he exists in all the fields for it is nowhere seen in the world that anybody is benefitted or harmed by a quality attributed to him through ignorance as for the statement that the illustration is not equally applicable that is wrong objection how reply because what is intended as common between the illustration and the thing illustrated is merely the superimposition through ignorance there is no disagreement as to that however as for your contention that the illustration fails with regard to the knower that too has been shown to be in apt by510 citing the example of decrepitude etc if it be held that objects of experience may be superimposed on one another but they cannot be superimposed on the experiencer the answer is that this cannot be a universal proposition for decrepitude and d eath which are matters of experience are superimposed on the self the experiencer objection may it not be that the knower of the field becomes a mundane being owing to his having ignorance reply no because ignorance is of the nature of tamas sinc e ignorance has the nature of covering it is indeed a notion born of tamas it makes one perceive contrarily or it arouses doubt or it leads to non perception for it disappears with the dawn of discrimination and the three kind of ignorance viz non perception etc etc false perception and doubt are experienced when there are such defects as blindness etc which are forms of tamas and have the nature of veiling it is known through the process of agreement and difference that false perception etc arise from some defectsand they are not the qualities of the self objection here it is asserted that if this be the case then ignorance is a quality of the knower reply no for the defects such as blindness are seen to belong to the eye which is a n organ as for your notion that ignorance is a quality of the511 experiencer and the very fact of being possessed of the quality of ignorance is what constitutes the mundane state of the knower of the field the assertion which was made by the vedantin i n that connection that the knower of th field is god himself and not a mundane being is improper this is not so as for example since such defects as false perception etc are seen to belong to the organ eye therefore false perception etc or thei r causes viz defects like blindness etc do not belong to the perceiver just as blindness of the eyes does not pertain to the perceiver since on being curved through treatment it is not seen in the perceiver similarly notions like non perception false perception doubt and their causes should in all cases pertain to some organ not to the perceiver the knower of the field and since they are objects of perception they are not qualities of the knower in the same way that light is of a lamp just be cause they are objects of perception they are cognized as different from ones own self besides it is denied by all schools of thought that in liberation when all the organs depart there is any association with such defects as ignorance etc if they the defects be the qualities of the self itself the knower of the field as heat is of fire then there can never be a dissociation from them again since there can be512 no association with or dissociation from anything for the immutable formless self wh ich is all pervading like space therefore it is established that the knower of the field is ever identical with god this follows alos from the utternance of the lord being without beginning and without qualities 31 etc objection well if this be so then owing to the nonexistence of the world and the mundane creatures there will arise the defect of the uselessness of the scriptures etc reply no since this defect is admitted by all a defect that is admitted by all who believe in the self i s not to be explained by one alone objection how has this been admitted by all reply people of all schools of thought who believe in the self admit that there is no worldly behaviour or the behaviour of a worldling in the liberated ones yet in their case ie in those various schools it is not admitted that there is any possibility of such a defect as the scriptures becoming useless etc similarly in our case let the scriptures be useless when the knowers of the field become identified with god and purposeful within the sphere of ignorance this is just as in the case of all the dualists where it is admitted that the scriptures etc become useful in the state of bondage not in the state of liberation objection well for us all dualists bonda ge and513 liberation of the self are real in the truest sense so when things to be renounced or accepted as also the means thereto are real the scriptures etc become meaningful on the other hand may it not be that for the non dualists since duality deo s not exist in truest sense it being the creation of ignorance therefore the state of bondage of the self is not ultimately real and hence the scriptures etc become purposeless as they remain shorn of a subject matter reply no since it is not logica l that the self should have different states if this were possible at all then the states of bondage and freedom of the self should be simultaneous or successive as to that they cannot occur simultaneously since they are contradictory like rest and m otion in the same object should they occur successively and without being caused then there will arise the contingency of there being no liberation if they occur through some cause then since they do not exist inherently there arises the contingency of their being ultimately unreal in this case also the assumption becomes falsified moreover when ascertaining the precedence and succession of the states of bondage and liberation the state of bondage will have to be considered as being the earlier an d having no beginning but an end and that is contrary to valid means of514 knowledge similarly it will have to be admitted that the state of liberation has a beginning but no end which is certainly opposed to valid means of knowledge and it is not possi ble to established eternality for something that has states nd undergoes a change from one state to another on the other hand if for avoiding the defect of non eternality the different states of bondage and liberation be not assumed then even for the dualists such defects as the purposelessness of the scriptures become certainly unavoidable thus the situation being similar for both it is not for the advaitin alone to refute the objection nor do the scriptures become purposeless because the scriptures are applicable to the commonly known unenlightened person it is indeed in the case of the ignorant person not in the case of the enlightened onethat there occurs the perception of identity of the self with the effect ie enjoyership and the cause ie agentship which are not self for in the case of the enlightened persons it is impossible that after the dawn of the realization of non identity of the self with effect and cause they can have self identification with these as i surely no t even a downright fool or a lunatic and such others see water and fire or shade and light as identical what to speak of a discriminating person515 therefore such being the case the scriptures dealing with injunction and prohibition do not concern a per son who sees the distinction of the self from effect and cause for when devadatta is ordered to do som work with the words you do this visnumitra who happens to be there does not even on hearing the command conclude i have been ordered but this conclusion is reasonable when the person for whom the order is meant is not understood so also with regard to cause and effect objection can it not be that even after having realized the self as different from effect and cuase it is quite reasonable from the standpoint of natural relationship natural relationship self identification with the body through ignorance that with regard to the scriptures one should have the understanding i am enjoined to adotp the means that yields a desired result a nd am porhibited from adopting the means that leads to an undesirable result as for instance in the case of a father and son or between others even though there exists the awareness of the distinction between each other still there is the comprehensi on of the implication of the injunctions and prohibitions meant for one as being also meant for the other in the br 1517 we read now therefore the entrusting when a516 man thinks he will die he says to his son you are brahman you are the sacrif ice and you are the world etc it has been enjoined here in this manner that the son should accept as his own all the duties thus entrusted to him by the father similarly it is understood that when a son in unable to perform his own duties the fathe r has to accept them so also in the case of brothers and others thus in the case of the enlightened person also though there is a comprehension of his own distinction from effect and cause still owing to his earlier relationship with ignorance body etc there is no contradiction in his understanding that the injunctions and prohibitions are meant for him reply no since identification of the self with effect and cause is possible only before attaining the knowledge of the self as distinct from them it is only after one has followed or eschewed what is enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures that he comprehends his own distinction from the effect and cause not before in bs 3426 7 it is said that the merit earned by the performance o f scriptural duties helps to generate knowledge of brahman therefore these duties are not meant for the enlightened by following what is enjoined and avoiding what is prohibited ones mind becomes purified and then only one517 understands he is differen t from cause and effect agentship and enjoyership tr therefore it is established that the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions are meant for the ignorant objection well if injunctions and prohibitions such as one who desires heav en shall perform sacrifices one should not eat poisoned meat etc be not observed by those who have realized the self as distinct and by those who view only the body as the self then from the absence of any observer of those injunctions etc there would follow the uselessness of the scriptures reply no because engagement in or abstention from actions follows from what is ordained by the scriptures as for one who has realized the identity of the lord and the knower of the field one who has real ized brahman he does not engage in action similarly even the person who does not believe in the self does not engage in action under the idea that the other world does not exist however one who has inferred the existence of the self on the ground of t he wellknown fact that study of the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions becomes otherwise purposeless who has no knowledge of the essential nature of the self and in whom has arisen hankering for the results of actions he faithfully518 enga ges in action this is a matter of direct perception to all to us hence the scriptures are not purposeless objection may it not be that the scriptures will become meaningless when by noticing abstention from action in the case of men with discriminati on their followers too will abstain reply no because discrimination arises in some rare person only for as at present some rare one among many people comes to possess discrimination besides fools do not follow one who has discrimination because their engagement in action is impelled by defects such as attachment etc and they are seen to get engaged in such acts as black magic moreover engagement in action is natural verily has it been said by the lord but it is nature that acts 514 therefore the mundane state consists of nothing but ignorance and is an object of perception to the ignorant man who sees it just as it appears to him ignorance and its effects do not belong to the knower of the feild the absolute moreover false knowledge cannot taint the supreme reality for water in a mirage cannot taint the supreme reality for water in a mirage cannot make a desert muddy with its moisture similarly ignorance cannot act in any way on the knower of the field hence has this be en said and understand me to519 be knower of the field as also knowledge remains covered by ignorance 515 objection then what is this that even the learned say like the worldly people thus possessed of aristorcracy etc am i this body wi fe etc verily belongs to me reply listen this is that learnedness which consists in seeing the field as the self on the contrary should they realize the unchanging knower of the field then they will not crave for enjoyment or action with the idea may this be mine enjoyment and action are mere perversions this being so the ignorant man engages in action owing to his desire for results on the other hand in the case of an enlightened person who has realized the changeless self engagement in aciton in impossible because of the absence of desire for results hence when the activities of the aggregate of body and organs cease his withdrawal from action is spoken of in a figurative sense some may have this other kind of learnedness the knowe r of the field is god himself and the field is something different and an object of knowledge to the knower of the field but i am a mundane being happy and sorrowful and it is my duty to bring about the cessation of worldly existence through the knowle dge of the field and the knower of the field and by continuing to dwell in his true nature520 after directly perceiving through meditation god the knower of the field and he who understands thus and he who teaches that he the taught is not the knower of the field and he who being under such an idea thinks i shall render meaningful the scriptures dealing with the worldly state and liberation is the meanest among the learned that selfimmolator being devoid of any link with the traditional inte rpreters of the purport of the scriptures misinterprets what is enjoined in the scriptures and imagines what is not spoken there and thereby himself becoming deluded befools others too hence one who is not a knower of the traditional interpretation is to be ignored like a fool though he may be versed in all the scriptures as for the objection that if god be one with the knower of the field he will then become a mundane being and that if the knowers of the fields are one with god then from the nonexistence of mundane beings will follow the absence of the mundane state these two objections have been refuted by admitting knowledge and ignorance as having different characteristics objection how reply by saying that any defect imagined through i gnorance does not affect the supreme reality which is the substratum of that imagination in accordance with this an521 illustration was cited that a desert is not made muddy by water in a mirage even the defect of the possibility of nonexistence of the mu ndange state consequent on the nonexistence of individual souls stands refuted by the explanation that the mundane state and the individual souls are imagined through ignorance objection the defect of mundane existence in the knower of the field consis ts in his being possessed of ignorance and sorrowfulness etc which are its products are matters of direct experience reply no since whatever is known is an attribute of the field therefore the knower the knower of the field cannot reasonably be taint ed by the defects arising from it whatsoever blemish not existing in the knower of the field you attribute to it is logically an object of experience and hence it is verily a quality of the field not the quality of the knower of the field nor does the knower of the field become tainted thereby because of knower cannot possibly have any conjunction with an object of knowledge should there be a conjunction then there will be no possibility at all of its the latters becoming a knowable oh sir if b eing ignorant sorrowful etc be qualities of the self how is it that they are directly perceived or how can they be qualities of the knower of the field if the conclusion be that522 all that is known consititutes the field and that the one who knows is verily the knower of the field then to say that being ignorant sorrowful etcare the qualities of the knower of the field and that they are directly perceived is a contradictory statement having only ignorance as its basis here the opponent asks t o whom does ignorance belong the answer is that it belongs verily to him by whom it is experienced objection in whom is it perceived reply here the answer is it is pointless to ask in whom is ignorance experienced objection how reply if igno rance be perceived by you then you perceive its possessor as well moreover when that possessor of ignorance is perceived it is not reasonable to ask in whom is it perceived for when an owner of cattle is seen the question to whom do the cattle belong does not become meaningful objection well is not the illustration dissimilar since the cattle and their owner are directly perceived their relation also is directly perceived hence the question is meaningless ignorance and its possessor a re not directly perceived in that manner in which case the question would have been meaningless reply what will it matter to you if you know the relation of ignorance with a person who is not directly perceived as possessed523 of ignorance opponent since ignorance is a source of evil therefore it should be got rid of reply he to whom ignorance belongs will get rid of it opponent indeed ignorance belongs to myself reply in that case you know ignorance as also yourself who possess it opponent i k now but not through direct perception reply if you know through inference then how is the connection between yourself and ignorance known surely it is not possible for you the knower to have at that time when you are knowing your own ignorance the knowledge of the relation of the self with ignorance which is an object of knowledge after having perceived ignorance as an object of your knowledge how can you who continue to be the knower cognize yourself as the knower of that ignorance for t his would lead to the contradiction of the same person becoming the subject and the object of cognition because the cognizer is then engaged in cognizing ignorance as an object besides there cannot be someone who is a separate cognizer of the relati on between the knower and ignorance and a separate cognition of that relation for this would lead to infinite regress if the knower and the relation between the knower and the thing known be cognizable then a separate cognizer has to be524 imagined of him again another knower has to be imagined of him again a separate cognizer would have to be imagined thus an infinite regress be comes unavoidable again whether the knowable be ignorance or anything else a knowable is verily a knowable similarly even a knower is surely a knower he does not become a knowable and when this is so since the knower cannot be known therefore his relation with ignorance also cannot be known by himself or by anybody else nothing of the cognizer the knower of the f ieldis tainted by such defects as ignorance sorrowfulness etc objection may it not be said that the selfs defect is surely this that the field which is full of defects is cognized by it reply no because it is the immutable which is conscio usness by nature that is figuratively spoken of as the cognizer it is just like figuratively attributing the act of heating to fire merely because of its natural heat just as it has been shown here by the lord himself that identification with action cause and effect are absent in the self and that action cause etc are figuratively attributed to the self owing to their having been superimposed on it through ignorance so has it been shown by him in various places he who thinks of this one as t he killer 219 while actions are being done in ever525 way by the gunas of nature 327 the omnipresent neither accepts anybodys sin 515 etc it has been explained by us too in that very way and in the following contexts also we shall explain accordingly objection well in that case if identification with action cause and effect be naturally absent in the self and it they be superimpositions through ignorance then it amounts to this that actions are meant for being undertaken only by the ignorant not by the enlightened reply it is true that is comes to this this very fact we shall explain under the verse since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body 1811 and in the context dealing with the conclusion of the purport of the whole scripture we shall explain this elaborately under the verse in brief indeed o son of kuntiwhich is the supreme consummation of knowledge ibid 50 it is needless here to expatiate further hence we conclude the next vers e hear aboutwhat that field is etc summarizing the purport of the chapter dealing with the field taught in the verses begining from this bodyetc is being presented for it is proper to introduce briefly the subject matter that is sought to be explained 134 hear from me in brief about all that as to what that field is and how it is what its changes526

field and the knower of the field which is intended to be taught 135 it has been sung of in variou s ways by the rsis separately by the different kinds the527 different branches of vedic texts of vedic texts and also by the rational and convicing sentences themselves which are indicatvie of and lead of brahman english translation of sri sankarachar yas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda

meditated upon br 147 which are indicative of and lead to brahman to528 arjuna who had become interested as a result of the eulogy the lord says 136 the great elements egoism intellect and the

those elements which are great owing to their pervasion of all midifications and which are subtle as for the gross elements they will be spoken of by the word indriya gocarah objects of the senses

e tc the followers of the sankhya call these which are such the twenty four categories thereafter the lord now says that even those qualities which the vaisesikas speak of as the attributes of the sould are certainly the attributes of the field but not o f the knower of the field 137 desire repulsion happiness sorrow the aggregate of body and organs sentience fortitude this field together with its modifications has been spoken of briefly english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskr it commentary swami gambhirananda 137 iccha desire having experienced again an object of that kind which had given him the feeling of pleasure earlier a man wants to have it under530 the idea that it is a source of pleasure that is this desire which is an attribute of the internal organ and is the field since it is an object of knowledge so also dvesah repulsion having experienced again an object of that kind which he had earlier felt as a cause of sorrow he hates it that is this repulsion an d it is surely the field since it is an object of knowledge similarly sukham happiness which is favourable tranquil having the quality of sattva is the field since it is an object of knowledge duhkham sorrow which is by nature adverse that t oo is the field since it is a knowable sanghatah is the aggregate the combination of body and organs cetana sentience is a state of the internal organ manifest in that aggregate like fire in a heated lump of iron and pervaded by an essence in th e form of a semblance of consciousness of the self that too is the field because it is an object of knowledge dhrtih fortitude by which are sustained the body and organs when they get exhausted that too is the field becuase it is an object of knowl edge desire etc have been selected as suggestive of all the qualities of the internal organ the lord concludes what has been said etat this ksetram field savikaram together with its modifications beginning from mahat buddhi has been531 samasena b riefly udahrtam spoken of that field which was referred to as this body is called the field 1 and is constituted by the aggregate of the constituents of the field has been explained in its different forms beginning from the great elements etc e nding with fortitude the knower of the field whose qualities are going to be described and by realizing which knower of the field along with his majesty immortality follows of him togehter with his attributes the lord himself will narrate in the verse i shall speak of that which is to be known 12 but for the present the lord enjoins the group of disciplines characterized as humility etc which lead one to the knowledge of that knower of the field that group of humility etc which are referred to by the word knowledge since they lead to knowledge and owing to the existence of which one becomes appropriately competent for the realization of that knowable and being endued with which a monk is said to be steadfast in knowledge 138 humility unpretentiousness non injury for bearance sincerity service of the teacher cleanliness steadiness control of body and organs532 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary

alone atma vinigrahah control of the aggregate of body and organs which is referred to by the word self but which is inimical to the self restricting only to the right path that aggregate which

english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 139 vairagyam non attachment the attitude of dispassion indriya arthesu with regard to objects of the senses viz sound etc with regard to seen or unseen objects of enjoyment eva ca and also anahankarah absence of egotis m absence of pride janma mrtyu jaravyadhi duhkha dosa anudarsanam seeing the evil in birth death old age diseases and miseries seeing the evil in each one of them from birth to miseries the evil in birth consists in lying in the womb and coming out of it seeing ie thinking of it similarly thinking of the evil in death so also seeing in old age the evil in the form of deprivation of intelligence strength and vigour and becoming an object of contempt in the same way thinking of the ev il in diseases like headtache etc so also with regard to miseries arising from causes physical natural and supernatural or duhkha dosa may mean the miseries themselves which are evil seeing as before that evil in the form of miseries in birth534 etcbirth is miserable death is miserable old age is miserable diseases are miserable birth etc are miserable because they cause misery not that they are miseries in themselves birth etc are perceivable events and as such are not miseries in themse lves thus when one thinks of the evil in the form of miseries in birth etc dispassion arises with regard to the pleasures in the body organs and objects from that follows the tendency of the organs towards the indwelling self for the realization of t he self the seeing of the evil in the form of misery in birth etc is called knowledge because it thus becomes a cuase of the rise of knowledge moreover 1310 non attachment and absence of fondness with regard to sons wives homes etc and constan t equanimity of the mind with regard to the attainment of the desirable and the undesirable english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1310 asaktih non attachment attachment means merely the kind for things arising from association the absence of that is asaktih and anabhisvangah absence of fondness abhisvangah is in fact a535 special kind of attachment consisting of the idea of selfidentification as for instance thinking i myself am happy or i am so rrowful when somebody else is happy or unhappy and thinking i live or i shall die when some body else lives or dies with regard to what in answer the lord says putra dara grhadisu with regard to sons wives homes etc from the use of etc it is understood that this fondness is even with regard to others who are liked very much retinue of sevants and so on and since both these absence of attachment and fondness lead to knowledge therefore they are called knowledge and nityam constan t sama cittatvam equanimity of mind mental equipoise with regard to what istaanista upapattisu the attainment of the desirable and the undesirable mental equipoise with regard to them always without exception one does not become happy on the att ainment of the desirable nor does he become angry on the attainment of the undesirable and that constant equanimity of mind which is of this kind is knowledge further 1311 and unwavering devotion to me with single minded concentration inclination to repair into a clean place lack of delight in a crowd of people536 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1311 ca and avyabhicarini unwavering not having any tendency to deviate bhaktih devotion may i to me to god ananya yogena with single minded concentration with undivided concentration ananyayogah is the decisive unswerving conviction of this kind there is none superior to lord vasudeva and hence he alone is our goal adoration with that that too is knowledge vivikta desa sevitvam inclination to repair into a clean place a place desa naturally free vivikta or made free from impurity etc and snakes tigers etc or place made solitary vivikta by being situated in a forest on a bank of a river or in a temple one who is inclined to seek such a place is vivikta desa sevi and the abstract form of that is vivikta desa sevitvam since the mind becomes calm in places that are indeed pure or solitary therefore meditation on the se lf etc occurs in pure or solitary places hence the inclination to retire into clean or solitary places is called knowledge aratih lack of delight not being happy jana samadi in crowd of people an assemblage a multitude of people without culture lacking in purity and immodest but not so in a537 gathering of pure and modest persons since that is conducive to knowledge hence lack of delight in an assembly of common people is knowledge since it leads to knowledge besides 1312 steadfastn ess in the knowledge of the self contemplation on the goal of the knowledge of reality this is spoken of as knowledge ignorance is that which is other than this english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1312 adhyatma jnana nityatvam steadfastness in the knowledge of the self adhyatma jnanam is the knowledge of the self etc constant dwelling in that is nityatvam tattva jnanartha darsanam contemplating on the goal of the knowledge of reality tattva jnanam is that realization of truth which arises from the fruition of application to the disciplines like humility etc which are the means to knowledge its goal artha is liberation the cessation of mundane existence contemplation darsana on that is tattva jnana artha darsanam for when one engages in contemplation on the result of the knowledge of reality one gets the urge to undertake the disciplines which are its538 means etat this those that have been stated from humility etc to contemplatio n on the goal of the knowledge of reality proktam is spoken of iti as jnanam knowledge because they are meant to lead one to knowledge ajnanam ignorance is yat that which is anyatha other atah than this what has been stated above contraril y arrogance pretentiousness cruelty revenge insincerity etc are to be known as ignorance so that since they are the cause of the origination of worldly existence they can be avoided to the question as to what is to be known through the aforesaid knowledge the lord says i shall speak of that which is to be known etc objection do not humility etc constitute yama and niyama see fn on p 239 tr the knowable is not known through them for humility etc are not seen to determine the nature of anything moreover everywhere it is observed that whatever knowledge reveals its own object that itself ascertains the nature of that object of knowledge the knowable indeed nothing else is known through a knowledge concerning some other object as for instance fire is not known through the knowledge of a pot reply this is not a defect for we have said that they are called knowledge because they lead one to knowledge539 and because they are auxiliary causes of knowledge 1313 i shall speak of that which is to be known by realizing which one attains immortality the supreme brahman is without any beginning that is called neither being nor non being english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1313 pravaksyami i shall speak of fully describe just as it is tat that yat which is jenyam to be known in order to interest the hearer through inducement the lord speaks of what its result is jnatva by realizing yat which knowable asnute one attains amrtam immortality ie he does not die again anadimat without beginning one having a beginning adi is adimat one not having a beginning is anadimat what is that the param supreme unsurpassable brahma brahman which is under disc ussion as the knowable here some split up the phrase anadimatparam as anadi and matparam because if the word anadimat is taken as a bahuvrihi compound that which has no a beginning adi is anadi matup is used to denote possession since the ide a of possession is a already540 implied in anadi therefore matup if added after it becomes redundant then the suffix mat matup becomes redundant which is undesirable and they show a distintive meaning brahman is anadi beginningless and is matpar am that of which i am the supreme para power called vasudeva trully the redundance could be avoided in this way if that meanig were possible but that meaning is not possible because what is intended is to make brahman known only through a negation o f all attributes by saying it is called neither being nor nonbeing it is contradictory to show a possession of a distinctive power and to negate attributes therefore although matup and a bahuvrihi compound convey the same meaning of possession it s matups use is for completing the verse the commentator accepts anadimat as a nantatpurusa compund if however the bahuvrihi is insisted on then the mat after anadi should be taken as completing the number of syllables needed for versification s o nat need not be compounded with param having aroused an interest through inducement by saying the knowable which has immortality as its result is beeing spoken of by me the lord says tat that knowable ucyate is called na sat neither being nor is it called asat non being objection after541 strongly girding up the loins and declaring with a loud voice i shall speak of the knowable is it not incongruous to say that is called neither being nor non being reply no what has been said is surely consistent objection how reply for in all the upanisads the knowable ie brahman has been indicated only by negation of all attributes not this not this br 4422 not gross not subtle op cit 338 etc but not as that is this for it is beyond speech objection is it not that a thing which cannot be expressed by the word being does not exist like wise if the knowable cannot be expressed by the word being it does not exist and it is contradictory to say it is the knowable and it cannot be expressed by the word being counter objection as to that no that it does not exist because it is not the object of the idea it is non being objection do not all cognitions verily involve the idea of being or non being this being so the knowable should either be an object of a cognition involving the idea of existence or it should be an object of a cognition involving the idea of non existence reply no because by virtue of its being super sensuous it is not an o bject of cognition involving either of the two ideas indeed any object perceivable by the senses such as pot etc can be either an object of542 cognition involving the idea of existence or it can be an object of cognition involving the idea of non exist ence but this knowable being supersensuous and known from the scriptures which are the sole means of its knowledge is not like pot etc an object of cognition involving either of the two ideas therefore it is called neither being nor non being as for your objection that it is contradictory to say it is the knowable but it is neither called being nor non being it is not contradictory for the upanisad says that brahman is surely different from the known and again it is above the unknown ke 14 objection may it not be that even the upanisad is contradictory in its meaning may it not be contradictory as it is when after beginning with the topic of a shed for a sacrifice cf pracinavamsam karoti he constructs ie shall constr uct the sacrificial shed with its supporting beam turned east ward tai sam also see sanskrit english dictionary monier williams tr it is said who indeed knows whether there exists anything in the other world or not tai sam 611 reply no since the upanisad speaking of something that is different from the known and the unknown is meant for establishing an entity that must be realized the upanisadic text is not to be rejected on the ground that it is paradoxical for it543 is meant to p resent brahman as indentical with ones own inmost self but whether there exists anything in the other world etc is merely an arthavada see note on p 40 here the passage whether there exists etc is to be interpreted as an arthavada emphasizing the need of raising a shed irrespective of any other consideration tr connected with an injunction from reason who it follows that brahman cannot be expressed by such words as being non being etc for every word used for expressing an object when heard by listeners makes them understand its meaning through the comprehension of its significance with the help of genus action quality and relation not in any other way because that is not a matter of experience to illustrate this a cow or a horse etc is comprehended through genus cooking or reading through action white or black through quality a rich person or an owner of cows through relation but brahman does not belong to any genus hence it is not expressible by words like being etc neither is it possessed of any qualitity with the help of which it could be expressed through qualifying words for it is free from qualities nor can it be expressed by a word implying action it being free from actions which accords wi th the upanisadic text partless544 actionless calm sv 619 nor has it any relation since it is one non dual not an object of the senses and it is the self therefore it is logical that it cannot be expressed by any word and this follows from suc h upanisadic texts as from which words trun back tai 241 etc therefore it is logical that it cannot be expressed by any word and this follows from such upanisadic texts as from which words turn back tai 241 etc since the knowable br ahman is not an object of the word or thought of being there arises the apprehension of its nonexistence hence for dispelling that apprehension by establishing its existence with the help of the adjuncts in the form of the organs of all creatures th e lord says 1314 that knowable which has hands and feet everwhere which has eyes heads and mouths everywhere which has ears everywhere exists in creatures by pervading them all english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1314 tat that the knowable sarvatah pani padam which has hands and feet everywhere the existence of the knower of the field is revealed545 through th adjuncts in the form of the organs of all creatures and the knower of the fiel d is spoken of as such because of the limiting adjuncts of the field the field too is diversely differentiated as hands feet etc all diversity in the knower of the field caused by the differences in the adjunct the field is certainly unreal hence by denying it the nature of the knowable has been stated in that is called neither being nor non being although the unreal form is caused by the limiting adjuncts still for the comprehension of its existence it is said it has hands and feet e verywhere etc by assuming this as a quality of the knowable thus as is well known there is saying of the people versed in tradition the transcendental is described with the help of superimposition and its refutation everywhere the hands feet et c which are perceived as limbs of all bodies perform their duties due to the presence of the power of the knowable brahman thus the grounds for the inference of the existence of the knowable are metaphorically spoken of as belonging to the knowable the others have to be explained similarly that knowable has hands and feet everwhere that which has eyes heads and mouths everywhere is sarvatoksi siromukham that which has ears every where is sarvatah546 srutimat sruti means the organs of hearing th at which has it is sruti mat tisthati it exists remains established loke in the multititude of creatures avrtya by pervading sarvam them all with this purpose is view that as a result of the superimposition of the organs like hands feet etc which are adjuncts there may not be the misconception that the knowable is possessed of them adjuncts the next verse is begun 1315 shining through the functions of all the organs yet devoid of all the organs unattached and verily the suppor ter of all without quality and the perceiver of qualities english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1315 sarvendriya guna abhasam shining through the functions of all the organs by the use of the words a ll the organs are understood ears etc known as the sense organs and motor organs as also the internal organs the intellect and the mind for they are equally the limiting adjuncts of the knowable besides the organs of hearing etc become the limiting adjuncts from the very fact of the internal organ becoming so hence the547 knowable gets expressed through determination thinking hearing speaking etc that are the functions of all the organs internal and external which are the limiting adjuncts in this way it is manifest through the functions of all the organs the idea is that that knowable appears to be as though active owing to the functions of all the organs as it is said in the upanisadic text it thinks as it were and shakes as it were br 437 for that reason again is it not perceived as being actually active in answer the lord says it is sarva indriya varitam devoid of all the organs ie bereft of all the instruments of action hence the knowable is not active through the f unctioning of the instruments of action as for the upanisadic verse without hands and feet he moves swiftly and grasps without eyes he sees without ears he hears sv 319 etc that is meant for showing that that knowable has the power of adapting itself to the functions of all the organs which are its limiting adjuncts but it is not meant to show that it really has such activity as moving fast etc the meaning of that verse is like that of the vedic text the blind one discoverd a gem tai ar 111 this is an artha veda see note on p530 which is not to be taken literally but interpreted in accordance with the context since the knowable548 is devoid of all the instruments of actions therefore it is asaktam unattached devoid of all associ ations although it is of this kind yet it is ca eva also verily the sarva bhrt supporter of all indeed everything has existence as its basis because the idea of existence is present everywhere verily even mirage etc do not occur without some b asis therefore it is sarva bhrt the supporter of all it upholds everything there can be this other organs as well for the realization of the existence of the knowable nirgunam without quality the qualities are sattva rajas and tamas that knowable i s free from them and yet it is the guna bhoktr perceiver of qualities ie that knowable is the enjoyer and experiencer of the qualities sattva rajas and tamas which assuming the forms of sound etc transform them selves into happiness sorrow de lusion etc further 1316 existing outside and inside all beings moving as well as non moving it is incomprehensible due to subtleness so also it is far away and yet near english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda549 1316 existing bahih outside the word bahih is used with reference to the body including the skin which is misconceived through ignorance to be the self and which is itself taken as the boundary similarly the word antah inside is u sed with reference to the indwelling self making the body itself as the boundary when outside and inside are used there may arise the contingency of the nonexistence of that in the middle hence this is said acaram caram eva ca moving as well as n ot moving even that which appears as the body moving or not moving is nothing but the knowable in the same way as the appearance of a snake on a rope is nothing but the rope in all empirical things moving as also non moving be the knowable why sho uld it not be known by all as such in answer it is said it is true that it shines through everything still it is subtle like space therefore although it is the knowable tat it is avijneyam incomprehensible to the ignorant people suksmatvat due t o its intrinsic subtleness but to the enlightened it is ever known from the valid means of knowledge such as the texts all this is verily the self ch 7252 brahman alone is all this nr ut7 etc it is durastham far away since to the une nlightened it is unattainable even550 in millions of years and tat that is antike near since it is the self of the enlightened 1317 and the knowable though undivided appears to be existing as divided in all beings and it is the sustainer of all beings as also the devourer and originator english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1317 and further tat that jneyam knowable though avibhaktam undivided remaining the same in all beings like space iva sthitam appears to be existing as vibhaktam divided bhutesu in all beings because it is perceived as existing in the bodies themselves and just as a rope etc are with regard to a snake etc that are falsely imagined similarly that knowable is bhutabhartr the sustainer of all beings sinced it sustains all during the period of their existence grasisnu the devourer at the time of dissolution and prabhavisnu the originator at the time of creation further it the knowable is not perceived though existing everywhere then it is darkness not what then551 1318 that is the light even of the lights it is spoken of as beyond darkness it is knowledge the knowable and the known it exists specially a variant reading is dhisthitam tr in the hearts of all english translation of sri sankaracharyas sans krit commentary swami gambhirananda 1318 tat that knowable is the jyotih light api even jyotisam of the lights of the sun etc for the lights like the sun etc shine because they are enkindled by the light of consciousness of the self as is kn own from upanisadic texts like illumined by whose light the sun shines tai br 31297 by its light all this shines variously sv 614 and from the smrti also as here in the gita itself that light in the sun 1512 etc it is ucyate spoken of as param beyond untouched by tamasah darkness ignorance for cheering up anyone who may become disheartened by thinking that knowledge etc is difficult to attain the lord says it is jnanam knowledge humility etc verse 7 etc jney am the knowable which has been spoken of in i shall speak of that which is to be known 12 and jnana gamyam the known the knowable itself is referred to as jnanagamyam552 when after being known it becomes the result of knowledge but when it is an object to be known it is called jneyam all these three which are such visthitam specially exist hrdi in the hearts in the intellects sarvasya of all of all creatures for these three are indeed perceived there this verse is begun for concludin g the topic under discussion 1319 thus has been spoken of in brief the field as also knowledge and the knowable by understanding this my devotee becomes qualified for my state english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1319 iti thus uktam has been spoken commencing from i shall speak of that which is to be known 12 and ending with it is spoken of as beyond darkness 17 samasatah in brief the ksetram field beginning with the great element s and ending with for titude 56 tatha as also jnanam knowledge beginning from humility 7 and ending with contemplation on the goal of the knowledge of reality 11 and the jneyam knowable all this has been stated by way of summarizing th e purport of the vedas and the553 gita who is fit for this true knowledge the answer is madbhaktah my devotee who attributes the fact of being the self of all to me who am god vasudeva the omniscient the supreme teacher and whose conviction has bee n saturated with the idea that whatever he sees hears or touches all that verily is lord vasudeva vijnaya by understanding etat this the aforesaid true knowledge he upa padyate becomes qualified mad bhavaya for my state bhava the state of bei ng the supreme self for that state of mine he attains liberation there in the seventh chapter have been presented the two aspects cf 1516 18 of god viz the higher and the lower characterized as the field and the knower of the field and it has al so been said understand thus that all things have these as their source 76 the explanation as to how creatures have the two aspects the field and the knower of the field as their source is now being stated 1320 know both nature and also th e individual soul prakrti is sometimes translated as matter and purusa as spirit tr to be verily without beginning know the modifications as also the qualities as born of nature554 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swam i gambhirananda 1320 viddhi know ubhau both prakrtim nature and also the purusam individual soul these two nature and the soul the aspects of god to be api verily anadi without beginning those two that have no beginning adi are anadi si nce the godhood of god is eternal therefore it is logical that even his aspects also should have eternality for gods god hood consists verily in having the two aspects those two aspects through which god becomes the cause of creation continuance and dissolution of the universe and which are beginningless are the sources of mundane existence some interpret the phrase anadi in the tatpurusa tatpurusa name of a class of compounds in which the first member determines the sense of the other members or in which the last member is defined or qualified by the first without losing its original independence vsa sense of na adi not primeval not cause according to them thereby indeed is established the causality of god again if nature and soul t hemselves be eternal the mundane existence would surely be their creation and the causality of the mundane existence would not be gods that is wrong555 because there being nothing to rule over before the emergence of nature and soul there will arise the contingency of god ceasing to be god and if the mundane state be uncaused uncaused ie not caused by nature and soul but by god independently of those two aspects there arises the contingency of the absence of liberation if god were himself the sole cause of mundane existence independently of his two aspects then it would be endless because there would be nothing to prevent liberated souls from being put under bondage again the scriptures becoming useless and the absence of bondage and freed om on the other hand all these become justifiable if god and the two aspects be eternal how viddhi know the vikaran modifications that will be spoken of the intellect etc the body and the organs ca eva as also gunan the qualities sattva etc manifest in the form of the mental states of happiness sorrow and attachment as prakriti sambhavan born of nature nature maya is the power of god which is the cause of the modifications and which consists of the three qualities those modifications and qualities which have that nature as their source know those modifications and qualities as born of nature as transformations of nature which556 again are those modifications and qualities born of nature 1321 with regard to the source of body and organs nature is said to be the cause the soul is the cause so far as enjoyership of happiness and sorrow is concerned english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1321 karya karana kartrtve with regard to the source of body and organs karya is the body and karana are the thirteen five sense organs five motor organs mind intellect and ego organs existing in it here by the word karya are understood the aforesaid elements that produce the body as also the objects which are modifications born of nature and since the qualities which are born of nature and manifest themselves as happiness sorrow and delusion are dependent on the organs therefore they are implied by the word karana organs the kartrtvam lit agentship with regard to these body and organs consists in being the source of the body and organs with regard to this source of the body and organs prakrtih nature ucyate is said557 to be the hetuh cause in the sense of being the originator thus by virtue of being the source of body and organs nature is the cause of mundane existence even if the reading be karya karana kartrtva karya effect modification will mean anything that is the transformation of something and karana cau se will be that which becomes transformed so the meaning of the compund will be with regard to the source of the effect and the cause or karya means the sixteen the eleven organs five sensory five motor and mind and the five objects sound etc modificaitons and karana means the seven mahat egoism and the five subtle elements transformations of nature they themselves are called effect and cuase so far as the agentship with regard to these is concerned nature is said to be the cause b ecause of the same reason of being their originator as to how the soul can be the cause of mundane existence is being stated purusah the soul the empirical being the knower of the field all these are synonymous is the hetuh cause bhoktrtve so far as enjoyership the fact of being the perceiver sukha duhkhanam of happiness and sorrow which are objects of experience is concerned how again is it asserted with respect to nature and soul that they are the causes of mundane existence by virtue of this fact558 of their respectively being the source of body and organs and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow as to this the answer is being stated how can there be any mundane existence if there be no modification of nature in the form of body and organs happiness and sorrow and cause and effect and there be no soul the conscious being to experience them on the other hand there can be mundane existence when there is a contact in the form of ignorance between nature modified in the form of bod y and organs and cause and effect as an object of experience and the soul opposed to it as the experiencer therefore it was reasonable to have said that nature and soul become the cause of mundane existence by respectively becoming the originators of the body and organs and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow what again is this that is called worldly existence worldly existence consists in the experience of happiness and sorrow and the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow it has been asserted that the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow how does it come about this is being answered 1322 since the soul is seated in nature therefore it experiences the qualities born of nature contact559 with the qualities is the cause of its births in good and evil wombs english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1322 hi since purusah the soul the experiencer is prakrtisthah seated in nature which is characterized as ignorance and gets transformed into body and organs ie since the soul has become identified with nature therefore bhunkte bhunkte l it enjoys here means experiences tr it enjoys ie experiences gunan the qualities manifest as happiness sorrow and delusion prakrtijan born of nature thinking thus i am happy sorrowful deluded learned even though ignorance continues a s a cause still the main cause of worldly existence of birth is the contact the selfidentification with the qualities happinesssorrow and delusion when they are experienced as is affirmed by the upanisadic text what it desires it resolves br 445 see sankaracaryas comm on this tr that very fact is stated here gunasangah contact with the qualities is karanam the cause asya of its the souls the experiencers sad asad yoni janmasu births in good and evil wombs self identific ation560 with the qualities is the cause of the experience of births in good and evil wombs or the meaning is selfidentification with the qualities is the cause or its worldly existence through birth in good and evil wombs where the words of worldly ex istence have to be supplied the good wombs are he wombs of gods and others evil wombs are the wombs of gods and others evil wombs are the wombs of beasts etc from the force of the context it is to be understood that there is no contradiction in includ ing even human wombs among good and evil wombs it amounts to saying that ignorance called being seated in nature and the contact with ie the desire for the qualities are the causes of worldly existence and this is said so that they can be avoided and in the scripture gita it is a well known fact that knowledge and dispassion accompanied with renunciation are the causes of removing this ignorance and self identification with the qualities that knowledge about the field and the knower of the f ield too has been presented earlier this has also been said in by realizing which one attains immortality 12 etc through the process of refutation of elements alien to the self and superimposition of qualities belonging to others that are not the self verse 12 deals with the refutation of alien elements and561 vere 13 with the superimposition of qualities belonging to others a direct presentation is again being made of that knowledge itself 1323 he who is the witness the permitte r the sustainer the experiencer the great lord and who is also spoken of as the transcendental self is the supreme person in this body english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1323 he who is the upadras ta witness who while staying nearby does not himself become involved as when the priests and the performer of a sacrifice remain engaged in duties connected with the sacrifice there is another called brahma remaining nearby who is unengaged is verse d in the science of sacrifices and witnesses the merit or demerit of the activities of the priest and the performer of the sacrifice similarly he who is not engaged in the activities of and is different from the body and organs who has characteristics o ther than theirs and is the proximate upa observer drasta of the body and organs engaged in their duties is the upa drasta or the observers are the body eyes mind intellect and the soul of them562 the body is the external observer proceeding inwa rds from that body the self is the inmost as also the proximate observer compared with which there is no other higher and inner observer the self because of being the most proximate observer is the upadrasta or it is the upadrasta since like the nonlooker of a sarifice it witness everything and he is the anu manta permitter anumananam approval means satisfaction with those performers viz body and organs as also their perfomances the agent of that approval is the anumanta or he is the anumanta since even though himself not engaged in the activities of the body and organs he appears to be favourably disposed towards and engaged in them or he is the anumanta because when the body and organs are engaged in their own functions he rem ains as a witness and never dissuades them it is the bharta sustainer bharanam means the continuance in their own state of the body organs mind and intellect which reflect consciousness and have become aggregated owing to the need of serving the purp ose viz enjoyment or liberation tr of some other entity viz the conscious self and that continuance is verily due to the consciousness that is the self in this sense the self is said to be the sustainer it is the bhokta563 experiencer as heat is by fire similarly the experiences of the intellect in the form of happiness sorrow and delusion in relation to all objects when born as though permeated by the consciousness that is the self are manifested differently by the self which is of the natu re of eternal consciousness in this sense the self is said to be the experiencer he is maheswarah the great god because as the self of all and independent he is the great ruler he is paramatma the transcendental self because he is the self which has the characteristics of being the supreme witness etc of all those beginning from the body and ending with the intellect which are imagined through ignorance to be the indwelling self he is api ca also uktah spoken of referred to in the upanisad s iti as with the words he is the indwelling one the paramatma the transcendental self ast reads atah in place of antah so the translation of the sentence will be therefore he is also referred to as the transcendental self in the upanisads tr where is he the parah suprem purusah person who is higher than the unmanifest and who will be spoken of in but different is the supreme person who is spoken of as the transcendental self 1517 is asmin in this dehe body what has been564 prese nted in also understand me to be the knower of the field 2 has been explained and conclude 1324 he who knows thus the person and nature along with the qualities will not be born again in whatever way he may live english translation of sr i sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1324 sah yah he who vetti knows in the manner described the purusam person that self possessed of the characteristics stated above as i myself am that and knows prakrtim nature as described above which is characterized as ignorance to have been eradicated by knowledge saha along with gunaih the qualities which are its modifications na abhijayate will not be born bhuyah again after the fall of this body of the man of reali zation he does not become born again for taking another body ie he does not take up another body sarvatha api in whatever way vartamanah he may live from the word api it is understood that it goes without saying that one who is firm in his own duty is not reborn objection though it has been said that there is absence of rebirth after the565 dawn of knowledge still is not illogical that actions done in the present life before the rise of knowledge and those done subsequently as also those done in the many past lives should be destroyed without yielding their results hence there should be three births for destruction of acquired merit is not logical to the same extent as actions that have produced the present birth and are yielding their pro per results cannot be destroyed besides it is not understood that actions have distinctions since all actions arise from ignorance they are on the same level so far so they are opposed to knowledge ie there can be no such distinction among action s as those which have started yielding results and those that have not therefore the actions of the three kinds without exception will produce three births or they all collectively will produce one birth otherwise if the acquired merits become destroyed it will lead to loss of faith everywhere as well as to the purposelessness of scriptures therefore it has been illogical to say he will not be born again reply no for the burning away of all the actions of the man of knowledge has been stated in hundreds of upanisadic texts such as and all ones actions become dissipated mu 228 anyone who knows that supreme566 brahman becomes brahman op cit 329 for him the delay is for so long only as he does not become freed ch 61 42 as the fibres at the tip of a blade of reed become completely burnt so all actions get completely burnt op cit 5243 here too the burning of all actions has been stated in as a blazing fire reduces pieces of wood to ashesetc 437 and he will also say so later see 1866 i shall free you from all sins etc tr this accords with reason also verily actions which arise from the seed of evils klesas evils see note under 819 tr like ignorance and desires germinate the sprout of rebirth here also it has been said by the lord in various places that actions which are associated with egoism and desire for results bear fruits not the others and there is also the verse as seeds burnt by fire do not germinate so als o the self does not acquire another body due to evils that have been burnt by knowledge cf mbh va 199 107 objection it may be granted for the present that actions performed after the rise of knowledge are burnt by knowledge since they coexist with knowledge but the burning away of actions done in this life prior to the rise of knowledge and those done in the many past lives is not reasonable reply no because of the qualification all actions 437 objection may it567 not be that all actions means those that are undertaken after illumination reply no for there is no reason for the restriction of the meaning on the other hand as for the statement just as actions that have produced the present birth and are already active in producing their results do not get dissipated even after illumination similarly it is not reasonable that actions which have not commenced producing their results should get dissipated that is wrong objection why reply since they have already begun producing results like an arrow that has been shot as an arrow freed earlier from a bow for hitting a target even after piercing through the target comes to a stop only after falling down as a result of the dissipation of its initial momentum similarly actions that produced the present body verily continue even after fulfilling the purpose of maintaining the body to exist as before until the dissipation of their inherent tendencies but as that very arrow when it has not acquired the momentum needed for action when it has not been shot even though fixed on the bow can be withdrawn similarly actions which have not begun yielding their results may be rendered unproductive by knowledge even while existing in their receptacle the internal organ bearing the reflection of consciousness hence it568 is established that it has been reasonable to state that on the fall of the present body of an enlightened person he is not born again here are being presented these meditation etc which are the alternati ve means for the realization of the self 1325 through meditation some realize the self in their intellect with the help of the internal organ others through sankhya yoga and others through karma yoga english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1325 dhyanena through meditation meditation means contemplation on the self after withdrawing into the mind with concentration the organs of hearing etc from the objects like sound etc and then withdrawin g the mind into the indwelling conscious self thus from the citation of such illustrations as the crane meditates as it were the earth meditates as it were the mountains meditate as it were ch 761 it follows that meditation is a constant a nd uninterrupted current of thought like a line of pouring oil through that meditation kecit some yogis pasyanti realize the indwelling conscious569 atmanam self atmani in their intellect atmana with the help of the internal organ that has been purified by meditation anye others sankhyena yogena through sankhya yoga sankhya means thinking these qualities viz sattva rajas and tamas are objects of my perception i am the self distinct from them a witness of their functions eternal and d ifferent from the qualities this sankhya is yoga by sankhya is meant that knowledge which arises from the foregoing reflection this knowledge is itself called yoga concentration of mind inasmuch as it is similar to yoga in leading to the realization of the self through that they realize the self with the help of the internal organ this is how it is to be construed and anye others karma yogena through karma yoga action itself being the yoga action performed with the idea of dedication to god i s figuratively called yoga since it leads to yoga others realize with the help of that action through purification of the mind and rise of knowledge the best among the yogis are competent for meditation dhyana the modiocre for reflection sankhy a and the lowest for karma yoga570 1326 others agian who do not know thus take to thinking after hearing from others they too who are devoted to hearing certainly overcome death english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1326 anye tu others again ajanantah who do not know the self as described above evam thus even in one of these alternative ways upasate take to thinking take to reflection being imbued with faith srutva after hearing an yebhyah from others from the teachers having been told think only of this te api ca they too sruti parayanah who are devoted to hearing to whom hearing is the supreme course the best discipline for starting on the path to liberation ie tho se who themselves lacking in discrimination accept only others advice as most authoritative eva certainly atitaranti overcome mrtyum death ie the mundane existence which is fraught with death the implication is it goes without saying that those discriminating people who are idenpendent in the application of the valid means of knowledge cross over death that the knowledge of the identity of the knower of the field and god leads to liberation has been stated in by realizing571 which one att ains immortality 12 for what reason is it so to point out that reason the next verse is begun 1327 o scion of the bharata dynasty whatever object moving or non moving comes into being know that to be from the association of the field and th e knower of the field english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1327 bharatarsabha o scion of the bharata dynasty yavat kincit whatever sattvam object as to whether they are without exception the lord says sthavara jangamam moving or non moving sanjayate comes into being viddhi know tat that as originati ng ksetra ksetrajna samyogat from the association of the field and the knower of the field objection what again is meant by this association of the field and the knower of the field since the knower of the field is partless like space therefore it s conjunction with the field cannot be a kind of relationship like coming together of a rope and a pot through the contact of their parts nor can it be an intimate and inseparable relation as between a thread and a572 cloth since it is not admitted that the field and the knower of the field are mutually related by way of being cause and effect reply the answer is the association of the field and the knower of the field which are the object and the subject respectively and are of different natures is in the form of superimposition of each on the other an also of their qualities as a consequence of the absence of discrimination between the real natures of the field and the knower of the field this is like the association of a rope nacre etc with the superimposed snake silver etc owing to the absence of discrimination between them this association of the field and the knower of the field in the form of superimposition is described as false knowledge after having known the distinction between and th e characteristics of the field and the knower of the field according to the scriptures and having separated like a stalk from the munjagrass the above described knower of the field from the field whose characteristics have been shown earlier he who rea lizes the knowable ie the knower of the field which in accordance with that is neither called being nor non being 12 is devoid of all distinctions created by adjuncts as identical with brahman and he who has the firm realization that the field is surely unreal like an573 elephant created by magic a thing seen in a dream an imaginary city seen in the sky etc and it appears as though real for him false knowledge becomes eradicated since it is opposed to the right knowledge described above sinc e the cause of his rebirth has been eliminated therefore what was said in he who knows thus the person and nature along with the qualities that the man of realization is not born again 23 has been a reasonable statement in hewill not be bor n again 23 has been stated the result of right knowledge which is the absence of birth owing to the destruction of ignorance etc the seeds of worldly existence the cause of birth viz the association of the field and the knower of the field brought about by ignorance has also been stated hence although right knowledge which is the remover of that ignorance has been spoken of still it is being stated over again in other words 1328 he sees who sees the supreme lord as existing equally in all beings and as the imperishable among the perishable english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda574 1328 sah he pasyati sees yah who pasyati sees whom parameswaram the supreme lord the lord who is sup reme as compared with the body organs mind intellect the unmanifest and the individual soul as tisthantam existing having his presence samam equally without distinction where sarvesu in all bhutesu beings all living things from brahma to th e non moving he who sees him existing equally in all living things the lord specifies them by the word vinasyatsu among the perishable and he also specifies him the supreme lord by the word avinasyantam the imperishable this is meant for showing th e absolute difference between the living things and god how for all the modifications see note 3 on p38 tr of an existing thing have as their root that modification of an existing thing described as birth all other modifications of existing things that follow birth end with destruction after destruction there is no modification of an existing thing because the object itself becomes nonexistent indeed qualities can exist so long as the thing qualified exists therefore by the reiteration of the absence of the last modification of an existing thing all its preceding modifications become negated along with their effects hence it is575 established that the supreme lord is very greatly different from all beings and is also unconditioned free from a ll modifications that things are subject to and one he sees who thus sees the supreme lord as described objection is it not that all poeple see what is the need of specification reply true they see but they see contrarily hence the lord specifie s he alone sees as in comparison with one who suffering from the eye disease called timira sees many moons the person who sees one moon is distingusihed by saying he alone sees similarly here as well the man who sees the one undivided self a s described above is distinguished from those who contrarily see many and differentiated selves by saying he alone sees others though seeing do not see because they see contrarily like the person who sees many moons this is the meaning the obove described true knowledge has to be praised by stating its result hence the verse begins 1329 since by seeing equally god who is present alike everywhere he does not injure the self by the self therefore he attains the supreme goal576 english transla tion of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1329 hi since pasyan by seeing by realizing samam equally isvaram god ie by realizing him as described in the immediately preceding verse who is samavasthitam present alike sarvatra everywhere in all beings what follows from seeing equally he na does not hinasti injure his own atmanam self atmana by the self by his own self tatah therefore as a result of that noninjuring yati he attains the param su preme gatim goal called liberation objection is it not that no creature whatsoever injures himself by himself why do you refer to an irrelevant thing by saying he does not injurewhich is like saying fire should neither be lit on the earth nor in the sky etc reply this defect does not arise because it is logical with reference to an unenlightened persons ignoring the self for all unillumined people ignore the very wellknown self which is manifest and directly perceptible and regard th e nonself as the self by performing righteous and unrighteous acts they destroy even that self which has been accepted and adopt another new self and destroying even that they take up another similarly destroying even that they adopt577 another in th is way they destroy the self that had been accepted successively thus all unillumined persons are destroyers of the self but that which is the self in reality even that remains as though destroyed for ever by ignorance because of the absence of any be nefit from its presence so all unenlightened persons are verily destroyers of the self on the contrary the other person who has realized the self as described does not injure in either way ie either through superimposition or through non super imposition the self by his own self therefore he attains the supreme goal ie the result stated above comes to him lest it be doubted that what was said in seeing equally god who is present in all beings he does not injure the self by the self is i mproper with regard to the selves which are diverse according to the differences created by the variety in their own qualities and actions the lord says 1330 and he who sees actions as being done in various ways by nature itself and also the self a s the non agent he sees english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda578 1330 and yah he who pasyati sees realizes karmani actions those performed through speech mind and body as kriyamanani being done being accomplished sarvasah in various ways prakrtya by nature nature is gods maya consisting of the three qualities as is said in the upanisadic text however know maya as nature sv 410 by that nature eva itself not by the other not by th e pradhana of the sankhyas known otherwise as prakrti which transforms itself in the form of cause and effects such as mahat etc tatha and also atmanam the self the knower of the field as akartaram the non agent devoid of all adjuncts sah he pasyati sees he is the one who has realized the supreme reality this is the idea what is implied is that there is no valid proof about differences in the non agent who is devoid of qualities and is unconditioned like space the lord elaborates again in other words that very true knowledge 1331 when one realizes that the state of diversity of living things is rooted in the one and that their manifestation is also from that then one becomes identified with brahman579 english translation of sri s ankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1331 yada when at the time when anupasyati one realizes having reflected in accordance with the instructions of the scriptures and the teachers one realizes as a matter of ones own direct experience that all this is but the self ch 7252 that bhuta prthak bhavam the state of diversity of living things is ekastham rooted in the one existing in the one self and their vistaram manifestation origination tatah eva is also from that when he realizes that origination in such diverse ways as the vital force is from the self hope is from the self memory smara memory see sankaracaryas comm on ch 7131 tr is from the self space is from the self fire is from the self water is from the self coming into being and withdrawal are ow ing to the self food is from the self op cit 7261 tada then at that time brahma sampadyate one becomes identified with brahman itself this is the import if the same self be the self in all the bodies then there arises the possiblity of its association with their defects hence this is said580 1332 being without beginning and without qualities o son of kunti this immutable supreme self does not act nor is it affected also translated as tainted tr although existing in the body english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1332 anadivat being without beginning adih means cause that which has no cause is anadih that which has a cause undergoes loss of its own characteristics but this one being causeless has no parts this being so it does not suffer loss so also nirgunatvat being without qualities indeed it si only something possessing qualities that perishes owing to the losss of its qualities but this one being without qual ities does not perish hence ayam this paramatma supreme self is avyayah immutable it suffers no depletion therefore it is immutable since this is so therefore api although sarira sthah existing in the body since the perception of the self o ccurs in the bodies it is said to be existing in the body even then it na does not karoti act from the very fact that it does not act it na is not lipyate affected by the result of any action for one who is an agent of action becomes affecte d by its result581 but this one is not an agent hence it is not affected by any result this is the meaning objection who is it again that acts in the body and becomes affected on the one hand if there be some embodied being other than the supreme sel f who acts and becomes affected then it has been improper to say in and also understand me to be the knower of the field etc that the knower of the field and god are one again if there be no embodied being who is different from god then it has to be stated who is it that acts and gets affected or it has to be asserted that the supreme one does not exist if the supreme one also acts like us then he is no god thus since the upanisadic philosophy as stated by the lord is in every way difficult to understand and difficult to explain it has therefore been abandoned by the vaisesikas the sankhyas the jainas and the buddhists reply as to that the following refutation has been stated by the lord himself in but it is nature that acts 514 indeed nature which is nothing but ignorance acts and becomes affected in this way empirical dealing becomes possible but in reality it does not occur in the one supreme self it has been accordingly shown by the lord in various places that there is no duty to be performed by those who adhere to this philosophy of discriminating582 knowledge of the supreme reality who are steadfast in knowledge who have spurned actions arising out of ignorance and who are mendicants belonging to the highest order of m onks the lord cites an illustration to show like what it does not act and is not affected 1333 as the all pervading space is not defiled because of its subtlety similarly the self present everywhere in the body the singular number is used to den ote a class ie all bodies see s tr is not defiled english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1333 yatha as sarva gatam the all pervading akasam space though pervasive still na upalipyate is n ot defiled does not come into contact saukmyat because of its subtlety tatha similarly atma the self avasthitah present sarvatra everywhere dehe in the body na is not upalipyate defiled further 1334 as the single sun illumines this wh ole world similarly o descendant of the bharata dynasty the knower of the field illumines the whole field583 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1334 yatha as ekam the one ravih sun prakasayati i llumines imam this krtsnam whole lokam world tatha similarly who ksetri the knower of the field ie the supreme self though one prakasayati illumines krtsnam the whole ksetram field from the great elements to fortitude cf 5 6 he re the illustration of the sun serves to highlight two aspects of the self viz that like the sun the self is one in all the fields and that it remains unaffected this verse is meant for summarizing the idea of the whole of this chapter 1335 thos e who know thus through the eye of wisdom the distinction between the field and the knower of the field and the annihilation of the matrix of beings they reach the supreme english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhira nanda 1335 ye those who viduh know evam thus in the manner described above jnana caksusa through the eye of wisdom the eye is the realization in the form of the knowledge of the self584 which arises from following the instructions of the scripture s and teachers through that eye of wisdom antaram the distinction the particular mutual distinction ksetra ksetrajnayoh beween the field and the knower of the field as they have been explained and bhuta prakrti moksam the annihilation of the matrix of beings the matrix of beings is that which is described as ignorance and is called the unmanifest those who know the annihilation moksanam of that matrix of beings te they yanti reach go to param the supreme to brahman the reality which is the suprme goal the idea is that they do not take up a body again585 chapter 14 141 the blessed lord said i shall speak again of the supreme knowledge the best of all knowledges by realizing which all the contemplatives reached the highest perfection from here english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 141 the word param should be connected with the remote word jnanam pravaksyami i shall speak bhuyah again even though spoken of more than once in all the preceding chapters of the param supreme it is supreme because it is concer ned with the supreme reality which is that jnanam knowledge uttamam the best since it has the best result jnananam of all knowledges of all knowledges does not mean of humility etc 137 11 what then it means among knowledges of all knowa ble things like sacrifice etc they do not lead to liberation but this knowledge leads to liberation hence the lord praises it with the words supreme and best so as to arouse interest in the intellect of the listener yat jnatva by realizing whi ch by attaining which knowledge586 sarve all munayah the contemplatives the monks but not those who espoused monasticsim as a formality in in the fourth stage of life gatah reached attained itah from here when this bondage of the body had ceased param the highest siddhim perfection called liberation and the lord shows the infallibility of this perfection 142 those who attain identity with me by resorting of this knowledge are not born even during creation nor do they suffer pain durin g dissolution english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 142 agatah those who attain mama sadharmyam identity with me the supreme god unity with my real nature sadharmyam however does not mean similari ty of attributes for in the scripture gita distinction between the knower of the field and god is not admitted and this statement of the result is by way of eulogy upasritya by resorting to ie by following idam this jnanam knowledge as describ ed ie by following the means to587 knowledge na are not upajayante born produced api even sarge during creation nor do they vyathanti suffer pain ie they do not perish pralaye during dissolution when even brahma perishes the lord says th at association of this kind between the field and the knower of the field is the origin of all beings 143 my womb is the great sustainer in that i place the seed from that o scion of the bharata dynasty occurs the birth of all things english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 143 mama my own maya ie prakrti consisting of the three qualities which belongs to me is the yonih womb here ast adds karanam cause off all the creatures tr for all the creatures since it prakrti is great mahat as compared with all its effects and it is the sustainer brahma prakrti is brahma since it permeates all of its own products ag of all its own transformations therefore the womb its elf is qualified as mahat brahma tasmin in that in the womb which is the great sustainer aham i god possessed of the power in the form of the two aspects viz the field and the knower of588 the field dadhami place deposit garbham the seed the seed of the birth of hiranayagarbha te seed which is the cause of the birth of all things ie i bring the field into association with the knower of the field who conforms to the nature of the limiting adjuncts viz ignorance desire and activity tatah f rom that from that deposition of the seed o scion of the bharata dynasty bhavati occurs sambhavah the birth origination sarva bhutanam of all things following the birth of hiranyagarbha 144 o son of kunti whatever forms are born from all th e wombs of

etc tasam of them of those forms mahat brahma the great sustainer which e xists as all the various forms is the yonih womb source aham i god am the pita father bija pradah who589 desposits the seed the agent of impregnation now is being stated which are the qualities and how they bind 145 o mighty armed one th e qualities viz sattva rajas and tamas born of nature being the immutable embodies being to the body english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 145 o mighty armed one who are possessed of hands which are great and mighty and extend upto the knees gunah the qualities are named sattva rajas and tamas and they prakrti sambhavah born of nature born of maya which belongs to god nibadhnanti bind as it were the avyayam immutable the immutability has been spoken of in the verse being without beginning etc 1331 dehinam embodied being dehe to the body the word guna is a technical term and is not a quality like colour etc which inhere in some substance nor is it meant here that quality and substance are different therefore they are ever dependent on the knower of the field just as qualities are dependent on some substance being of the nature of ignorance they bind the knower of590 the field as it were they come into being making that knower their sustainer in this sense it is said that they bind objection was it not said that the embodied one does not become defiled see 1331 2 so why as it contrarily said here that they bind reply we have rebutted this objection by usi ng the word iva as it were in they bind as it were 146 among them sattva being pure nirmala pure transparent ie capable of resisting any form of ignorance and hence as illuminator iea revealer of consciousness is an illuminator an d is harmless o sinless one it binds through attachment to happiness and attachment to knowledge english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 146 tatra among them among sattva etc the characteristics of s attva itself is being stated first sattva nirmalatvat being pure like a crystal stoneis prakasakam an illuminator and anamayam harmless anagha o sinless one badhnati it binds how sukhasangena through attachment to happiness bringing about the591 association of happiness which is the object with the self which is the subject in the form of the idea i am happy is certainly an unreal contact with happiness this as such is nescience for the quality of an object cannot belong to a subject a nd it has been said by the lord that all the qualities from desire to fortitude see 136 are indeed of the field which is the object therefore it is certainly through nescience which is an attribute in reality though nescience has no connec tion with the self yet since there is none other with which it can become associated and since it has no independence therefore the commentator imagines it as an attribute of the self of the self and has the characteristics of non discrimination betwe en object and subject that sattva apparently brings about the association with happiness which is not the self it makes the self attached as it were here ast adds asangam saktam iva makes the unattached attached as it were tr makes one no t possessed of happiness as though possessed of it similarly it binds also jnana sangena through attachment to knowledge jnana derived in the sense of that through which one knows means an instrument of knowledge and not consciousness s knowl edge arising from the study of the import of various scriptures592 or jnanam means the scriptures through which the supreme god is known and which leads to devotional practices but not to steadfastness in the absolute brahman because of its concomita nce with happiness knowledge here is an attribute of the internal organ the field but not of the self were it an attribute if knowledge were a natural attribute of the self then there can be no question of the latter again becoming bound through asso ciation with the former of the self there could be no contact between it and the self and bondage would become illogical association with knowledge etc should be understood in the same sense as with happiness 147 know rajas to be of the nature of passion born of hankering and attachment o son of kunti that binds the embodied one through attachment to action english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 147 viddhi know rajas to be ragatmakam of the nature of passion raga is derived in the sense of that which colours having the property of colouring like the ochre pigment etc trsna asanga samud bhavam born of hankering and593 attachment hankering is the longing for things not acquired attac hment is the clining of the nature of fondness of the mind to things in possession o son of kunti tat that that rajas nibadhnati binds dehinam the embodied one karma sangena through attachment to actions deep involvement in actions related to se en or unseen objects is karmasangah rajas binds through that 148 on the other hand know tamas which deludes all embodied beings to be born of ignorance o scion of the bharata dynasty that binds through inadvertence laziness and sleep english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 148 viddhi know tamas the third qualitty mahanam which deludes which is a cause of indiscrimination sarva dehinam of all embodied beings to be ajnanajam born of ignorance o scion of the bharata dynasty tat that tamas nibadhnati binds pramada alasya nidrabhih through inadvertence laziness and sleep the activities of the qualities are again being briefly stated594 149 o scion of the bharata dynasty sat tva attaches one to happiness rajas to action while tamas covering up knowledge leads to inadvertence also english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 149 o scion of the bharata dynasty sattva sanjayati attaches one sukhe to happiness rajas attaches is understood karmani to action tu while tamas avrtya covering up veiling jnanam knowledge the discrimination produced by sattva sanjayati leads pramade to inadvertence uta also pramada means non performance of a duty on hand when do the qualities produce the effects stated above that is being answered 1410 o scion of the bharata dynasty sattva increases by subduing rajas and tamas rajas by overpowering sattva and tamas and tama s by dominating over sattva and rajas english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1410 o scion of the bharata dynasty sattva bhavati increases comes into being abhibhuya by595 subduing both rajas and tamas when sattva increases then coming to its own it produces its own effects knowledge happiness etc similarly when the quality of rajas increases by overpowering both sattva and tamas then it produces its own effects activity and hankering when the q uality called tamas increases by similarly dominating over sattva and rajas it then produces its own effects obscuring of knowledge etc when any quality preponderates then what is its indication this is being answered 1411 when the illumination that is knowledge radiates in this body through all the doors of the senses then one should know that sattva has increased greatly english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1411 yada when prakasah the illumination prakasa illumination is a function of the internal organ intelligence that itself is jnanam knowledge when this illumination called knowledge upajayate radiates asmin in this dehe body sarva dvaresu through all the doors all the s ense organs viz ear etc are the selfs596 doors of perception through all those doors tada then through this indication viz the illumination that is knowledge vidyat one should know iti that sattva has vivrddham increased uta greatly see a gtr this is the characteristics of rajas when it has become prominent 1412 o best of the bharata dynasty when rajas becomes predominant these come into being avarice movement undertaking of actions unrest and hankering english trans lation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1412 o best of the bharata dynasty when the quality of rajas vivrddhe becomes predominant etani these indications jayante come into being lobhah avarice the desire to appropriate others possessions pravrtih movement in general arambhah under taking of what karmanam of actions asamah unrest lack of tranquillity ie manifestation of joy attachment etc and sprha hankering desire in general for all things597 1413 o descendant of the kuru dynasty when tamas predominates these surel y ie without exception ms come into being non discrimination and inactivity inadvertence and delusion english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1413 kuru nandana o descendant of the kuru dynasty w hen the quality of tamas vivrddhe predominates etani these indications eva surely jayante come into being extreme aprakasah non discrimination and apravrttih inactivity its ie of nondiscrimination effects pramadah in advertence and moh ah delusion ie stupidity which is a from of non discrimination whatever result is achieved even after death that is also owing to attachment and desire every thing is certainly caused by the qualities by way of showing this the lord says 1414 when an embodied one undergoes death while sattva is exclusively prodominant then he attains the taintless worlds of those who know the highest entities598 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1414 yad a when deha bhrt an embodied one the soul yati undergoes pralayam death sattve pravrddhe while sattva is predominant tu exclusively tu is used to exclude rajas and tamas s tada then pratipadyate he attains ie gains the amalan tainl ess stainless lokan worlds the worlds of brahma etc which are free from the impurity of predominance either of rajas or tamas uttamavidam of those who know the highest ie of those who have known the principles mahat and the rest 1415 when one dies while rajas predominates he is born among people attached to activity similarly when one dies while tamas predominates he takes birth among the stupid species english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhiran anda 1415 pralayam gatva when one does rajasi while the quality of rajas predominates jayate he is born karma sangisu among people attached to activity among human beings having attachment to work599 tatha similarly in that very way pralinah w hen one dies tamasi while tamas predominates jayate he takes birth mudha yonisu among the stupid species such as animals etc a summary of the idea of the preceding three verses is being stated 1416 they say that the result of good work is pur e and is born of sattva but the result of rajas is sorrow the result of tamas is ignorance english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1416 ahuh they the wise persons say that phalam the result sukrta sya of good karmanah work ie acts having the sattva quality is verily nirmalam pure and is sattvikam born of sattva tu but phalam the result rajasah of rajas ie of acts that have the qualitty of rajas for the topic relates to actions is duhkham sorrow in accordance with its cause the result too is indeed sorrow a product of rajas so also ajnanam ignorance is as before the result tamasah of tamas of unrighteous acts that have the quality of tamas what else results from the q ualities600 1417 from sattva is born knowledge knowledge acquired through the sense organs and from rajas verily avarice from tamas are born inadvertence and delusion as also ignorance to be sure english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1417 sattvat from sattva when it predominates sanjayate is born jnanam knowledge and rajasah from rajas is verily born lobhah avarice tamasah from tamas bh avatah are born both pramada mohau in advertence and delusion as also ajnanam ignorance absence of discrimination eva ca to be sure further 1418 people who conform to sattva go higher up those who conform to rajas stay in the middle thos e who conform to tamas who conform to the actions of the lowest quality go down english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1418 sattvasthah people who conform to sattva to the actions of sattva quality g acchanti go are601 born undhavam higher up in the worlds of gods and others rajasah those who conform to rajas those who are endowed with sense knowledge and actions consequent on the preponderance of rajas tisthanti stay are born madhye in the middle among human beings tamasah those who conform to tamas jaghanya gunavrttasthah a variant reading is vrttisthah tr who conform to actions of the lowest quality of tamas those who are attached to its actions sleep laziness etc the fooli sh gacchanti go adhah down ie they are born among cattle etc the association owing to the false ignorance in the form of being seated in nature that an individual soul has with the gunas in the form of happiness sorrow and delusion and whic h are matters of experience in such ways as i am happy i am sorrowful i am ignorant that association is the cause of the individual souls mundane existence characterized by coming to have births in good and bad species this was stated briefly in the earlier chapter elaborating that here in the text beginning with the qualities viz sattva rajas and tamas born of nature 5 the lord has said that the nature of the qualities the conduct conforming to the qualities and the power to bind that the qualities have through actions conforming to them and also the602 course of a person under the bondage of behaviour conforming to the qualities all this is false knowledge it has ignorance as its root and is the cause of bondage now it is neces sary to state that liberation follows from right knowledge hence the lord says 1419 when the witness sees none other than the qualities as the agent and knows that which is superior ie different from to the qualities he attains my nature english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1419 yada when drasta the witness after becoming illumined anupasyati sees na anyam none other gunebhyah than the qualities that have transformed into the shape of body orgnas and objects kartaramas the agent ie he sees thus that the qualities themselves in all their modes are the agents of all activities ca and vetti knows that which standing as the witness of the activities of the qualities is p aram superior gunebhyah to the qualities sah he the witness adhigacchati attains madbhavam my nature how does he attain that is being stated603 1420 having transcended these three qualities which are the origin of the body the embodied one b ecoming free from birth death old age and sorrows experiences immortality english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1420 atitya having transcended having gone beyond even while living etan these trin three gunan qualities as have been described which constitute the limiting adjunct maya and dehasamudbhavan which are the origin of the body which are the seed of the birth of the body dehi the embodied one the enlightened one vimuktah becomin g free even in this life janma mrtyu jaraduhkhaih from birth death old age and sorrow asnute experiences some translate this as attains tr amrtam immortality in this way he attains my nature this is the idea getting a clue to a question fr om the statement that one experiences immortality even in this life by going beyond the qualities 1421 arjuna said o lord by what signs is one known who has gone beyond these three604 qualities what is his behaviour and how does he transcend t hese three qualities english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1421 prabho o lord kaih by what lingaih signs bhavati is one known atitah who has gone beyond etan these trin three gunan quali ties that have been explained kim what is his acarah behaviour ca and katham how in what way ativartate does he transcend ast adds here atitya vartate in what way does he exist after transcending the three qualities tr etan these trin three gunan qualities in this verse the signs of one who has gone beyond the qualities and the means of transcending them have been asked by arjuna by way of replying to the two questions the lord said as for the question with what sings d oes one who has gone beyond the qualities become endowed with listen to them 1422 the blessed lord said o son of pandu he neither dislikes illumination knowledge activity and delusion when they appear nor does he long for them when they d isappear605 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1422 na dvesti he neither dislikes these prakasam illumination knowledge an effect of sattva pravrttim activity an effect of rajas and moham delusion an effect of tamas sampravrttani when they appear when they fully emerge in the form of ob jects of experience in me has arisen a perception which is a result of tamas thereby i have become deluded so also in me has risen the inclination to action which is painful and is born of rajas by that rajas i have been actuated carried away from my own nature this is a matter of sorrow to me that there has been a deviation from my own nature similarly the quality of sattva in the form of illumination that is knowledge binds me by attributing discrimination to me and making me attached to happiness by thinking in these ways one dislikes them because of his being not fully enlightened the person who has transcended the qualities does not dislike them in this manner unlike a person having sattva etc who longs for the effects of sat tva etc which withdraw themselves after becoming manifest to him the person who has gone beyond the qualities na kanksati does not long for them in that way606 nivrttani when they disappear this is the idea this is not an indication that can be perceiv ed by others what then since this characteristic is perceivable to oneself it is merely subjective for dislike or longing which is a subjective experience of a person is not seen by another now then the lord gives the reply to the question what is the behaviour of one who has gone beyond the qualities 1423 he who sitting like one indifferent is not distracted by the three qualities he who thinking that the qualities alone act remains firm and surely does not move english translati on of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1423 he the self realized monk yah who asinah sitting udasinavat like one indifferent as an indifferent man sides with nobody similarly this one set on the path leading to the transcendence of the qualities na is not vicalyate distracted from the state of knowledge arising out of discrimination gunaih by the qualities this point is being clarified as such yah he who thinking iti that gunah the qualities which have trasnformed607 into body organs and objects vartante act on one another avatisthati remains firm avatisthati instead of avatisthate is used in the parasmaipada to avoid a break in the metre or there is different reading yah anutisthati who acts his apparent activity consists in the mere continuance of actions which have been subjectively sublated through enlightenment and an does not ingate move ie becomes eva surely settled in his own nature 1424 he to whom sorrow and happiness are alike who is established in his own self to whom a lump of earth iron and gold are the same to whom the agreeable and the disagreeable are the same who is wise to whom censure and his own praise are the same english translation of sri sankara charyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1424 moreover sama duhkha sukhah he to whom sorrow and happiness are alikesvasthah who is established in his own self tranquil sama losta asma kancanah to whom a lump of earth iron and gold are the same tulya priya apriyah to whom the agreeable and the disagreeable are the same dhirah who is wise tulya ninda atma608 samstutih to whom to which monk censure and his own praise are the same 1425 he who is the same under honour and dishono ur who is equally disposed both towards the side of the friend and of the foe who has renounced all enterprise he is said to have gone beyond the qualities english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1425 further tulyah he who is the same unperturbed mana apamanayoh under honour and dishonour tulyah who is equally disposed mitra aripaksayoh both towards the side of the friend and of the foe although from their own standpoint some may be unat tached still in others view they may appear to be siding either with friends or foes hence it is said equally disposed both towards the side of the friend and of the foe sarva arambha parityagi who has renounced all enterprise those which are un dertaken are arambhah actions intended for seen or unseen results ie who is apt to give up all undertakings who has given up all actions other than those needed merely for the maintenance of the body609 sah he ucyate is said to have gunatitah gon e beyond the qualities the disciplines leading to the state of transcendence of the qualities which have been stated in the verses beginning from he who sitting like one indifferent and ending with he is said to have gone beyond the qualities ha ve to be practised by a monk a seeker of liberation so long as they are to be achieved through effort but when they become firmly ingrained they become the indications perceivable to himself of a monk who has transcended the qualities now the lord g ives the reply to the question and how does he transcend the qualties 1426 and he who serves me through the unswerving yoga of devotion he having gone beyond these qualities qualifies for becoming brahman english translation of sri sankarach aryas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1426 and he be he a monk or a man of action rites and duties yah who sevate serves mam me god narayana residing in the hearts of all beings avyabhicarena through the unswerving that which nev er wavers bhakti yogena yoga of610 devotion devotion bhakti devotion supreme love through which one becomes united with god is yoga itself being the yoga sah he samatitya having transcended etan these gunan qualities as described kalpate qualifies ie becomes fit brahma bhuyaya bhuyah is the same as bhavanam for becoming brahman for liberation how this is so is being stated 1427 for i am the abode of brahman the indestructible and immutable the eternal the dharma and absolute bliss english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1427 hi for aham i the inmost self am the pratistha brahmanah abode that in which something abides is pratistha of brahman which is the supreme self of brahman of what kind amrtasya of that which is indestructible avyayasya of that which is immutable and sasvatasya of that which is eternal dh armasya of that which is the dharma realizable through the yoga of jnana which is called dharma virtue and aikantikasya sukhasya of that which is the611 absolute unfailing bliss by nature since the inmost self is the abode of the supreme self which by nature is immortal etc therefore through perfect knowledge it the former is realized with certainty to be the supreme self this has been stated in he qualifies for becoming brahman the purport is this indeed that power of god through which br ahman sets out comes forth for the purpose of favouring the devotees etc that power which is brahman itself am i for a power and the possesser of that power are non different or brahman means the conditioned brahman since it too is referred t o by that word of that brahman i myself the unconditioned brahman and none elseam the abode the abode of brahman of what qualities of that which is immortal of that which has the quality of deathlessness of that which is immutable so also of that which is the eternal which is the dharma having the characteristics of steadfastness in knowledge of that which is the absolute unquestionably certain bliss born of that steadfastness i am the abode is understood612 chapter 15 151 the b lessed lord said they say that the peepul tree which has its roots upward and the branches downward and of which the vedas are the leaves is imperishable he who realizes it is knower of the vedas english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskri t commentary swami gambhirananda 151 urdhva mulam that which has its roots upwards brahman possessed of the unmanifest power in the form of maya is referred to by the word upward because of its subtleness in point of time by virtue of its being the cause and also because of its eternality and vastness and that is the root mulam of this world the tree of the world which is such is urdhva mulam this accords with the upanisadic text this has its roots above and branches below ka 261 in the purana also we have it sprouts from the root in the form of the unmanifest it grows through the sturdiness of that very one and it has abundance of intelligence as its trunk and the appertures of the organs as the hollows the great elements ar e its boughs ag takes the word visakha boughs613 in the sense of stambha perhaps meaning the aerial roots tr so also it has the objects of perception as its leaves it has virtue and vice as its beautiful flowers and happiness and sorrow are the f ruits it bears this eternal tree presided over by brahman is a means of livelihood to all creatures and this verily is the resort of brahman or etat brahma vanam means this tree has brahman as its object of adoration its support for the world has n othing but brahman as its support in it brahman dwells for ever having felled and split this tree with the great sword of knowledge and then attaining the bliss of the self one does not return from that bliss cf mbh as 4712 15 that tree whi ch has its roots upwards and is constituted by the enchantment of mundane existence and adhah sakham which has the branches downwards mahat see under 74 tr egoism subtle elements etc are its branches sakhah as it were extending downwards adhah so it has its branches downwards that tree with its branches downwards which does not a last stha even for the morrow svah is asvatthah lit peepul tree ahuh they say that the asvatthah peepul tree undergoing destruction every momen t is avyayam imperishable and constituted by the enchantments of mundane614 existence having been in existence from time without beginning that tree of the world is imperishable it is indeed will known as the sustainer of the beginningless and ceasele ss series of bodies etc they call that the imperishable of that very tree of the world here is another qualification yasya that tree of the world of which chandamsi chandas being derived in the sense of covering protecting the vedas in the form of rk yajus and sama are the parnani leaves as it were as leaves serve as protectors of a tree so the vedas serve as the protectors of the world for they reveal what are virtue and vice as also their causes and results yah he who veda knows tam thatthe tree of the world along with its root as has been explained sah he is a vedavit knower of the vedas ie versed in the meaning of the vedas since apart from this tree of the world along with its root not even an iota of any other thing re mains to be known therefore he who knows the purport of the vedas is omniscient in this way the lord euligizes the knowledge of the tree together with its root an imagery of the other parts of that very tree of the world is being presented615 152 the branches of that tree extending down wards and upwards are strengthened by the qualities and have sense objects as their shoots and the roots which are followed by actions spread down wards in the human world according to ag and ms manusya loke means a body distinguished by brahminhood etc english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 152 sakhah the branches as it were tasya of that tree prasrtah extending adhah downwards from the human be ings to the immobile trees etc ca and urdhvam upwards upto brahma beginning from the creator of the cusmos to dharma death according to ag human beings stands for the world of human beings and brahma for the world of brahma satva loka so dharma may mean the world of death pitr loka tr which in accordance with their work and in conformity with their knowledge ka 227 are the results of knowledge and actions

sprout as it were like new leaves from the branches bodies etc which are the results of actions thereby the branches are said to have sense objects as their shoots the supreme root the material cause of the tree of the world has been stated earlier and now the latent impressions of attraction repulsion etc born of the results of action are the subsi diary roots as it were which grow later on and become the cause of involvement in righteousness and and unrighteousness and those mulani roots karma anubandhini which are followed by actions anu santatani spread enter adhah downwards as compare d with the world of gods manusya loke into the world of human beings particularly for it is well known that only here men have competence for rites and duties they these roots are said to be karma anubandhini since actions karma that are character ized as righteous and unrighteous follow as their product anubandha ie succeed the rise of those attraction repulsion etc 153 its form is not perceived here in that way nor its end nor beginning nor continuance after felling this peep ul whose roots are well developed with the strong sword of detachment617 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 153 but asya its of this tree of the world which has been described rupam form as it has been presented na is not at all upalabhyate perceived iha here tatha in that way for being like a dream water in a mirage jugglery an imaginary city seen in the sky it is by nature destroyed no sooner than it is seen therefore na there exists neither its antah end limit termination so also neither its beginning it is not comprehended by anyone that it comes into existence beginning from any definite point its sampratistha continuance the middle state too is not perceived by anyone chittva after felling uprooting together with its seeds enam this above described asvattham peepul the tree of the world suvirudha mulam whose ro ots mula are well su developed virudham drdhena with the strong hardened by a resolute mind directed towards the supreme self and sharpened on the stone of repeated practice of discrimination asanga sastrena sword of detachment detachment means turn ing away from the desire for progeny wealth and the worlds with that sword of detachment618 154 thereafter that state has to be sought for going where they do not return again i take refuge in that primeval person himself from whom has ensued the eternal manifestation english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 154 tatah thereafter tat that padam state of visnu parimargitavyam has to be sought for ie realized gatah going entering yas min where into which state they na do not nivartanti return bhuyah again for worldly life as to how it is to be sought for the lord says prapadye i take refuge tam in that adyam primeval existing from the beginning purusam person who ha s been mentioned by the word state eva himself the search has to be carried on thus ie by taking refuge in him who is that person that is being stated yatah from whom from which person prasrta has ensued like jugglery from a magician purani the eternal pravrttih manifestation the magic tree of the world what kind of persons reach that state this is being answered619 155 the wise ones who are free from pride and nondiscrimination who have conquered the evil of association hatred and love arising from association with foes and friends who are ever devoted to spirituality completely free from desires free from the dualities called happiness and sorrow reach that undecaying state english translation of sri sankaracharyas san skrit commentary swami gambhirananda 155 amudhah the wise ones who are devoid of delusion who are nirmana mohah free from nir pride mana and non discrimination moha jita sanga dosah who have conquered jita the evil dosa of association sanga association itself being the evil those who have conquered that

vinivrtta kamah who are completely vi free from nivrtta desires kamah whose desires have completely gone away without trace ni the men of self control the monks vimuktah who are free from have got rid of dvandvaih the dual itieslikes dislikes etc sukha duhkha620 sanjnaih called happiness and sorrow gacchanti reach tat that avyayam undecaying padam state as has been described above the very state is being elaborated again 156 neither the sun nor the moon no r fire illumines that that is my supreme abode reaching which they do not return english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 156 na suryah niether the sun though possessed of the power of illumining everyth ing so also na sasankah nor the moon na pavakah nor even fire bhasayate illumines tat that this word refers to the remote word dhama abode at the end of the verse that abode which is of the nature of light that abode the state of visnu gatva reaching attaining yat which they na do not nivartante return and which the sun etc do not illumine tat that is mama my visnus paramam supreme dhama abode state objection it has been said reaching which they do not return is it not well known that all goings end verily in returning and unions are followed by separations how is it said that there is no return for those who621 come to that abode reply as to that listen to the reason 157 it is verily a part of mine w hich becoming the eternal individual soul in the region of living beings draws to itself the organs which have the mind as their sixth and which abide in nature english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 157 it is eva verily amsah a part portion limb fragment these are all synonymous mama of mine of the supreme self here ast adds narayanasya of narayana tr which jiva bhutah sanatanah becoming the eternal individual soul will known as t he enjoyer and agent jiva loke in the region of living beings ie in the world as the sun reflected in water is a part of the actual sun and goes to the sun itself and does not return when the water the cause of the reflection is removed so also even this part becomes similarly united with that very self or as space enclosed in a pot etc delimited by such adjuncts as the pot etc being a part of space does not return after being united with space when the cause of limitation viz pot etc is destroyed this being so622 it has been rightly stated by reaching which they do not return objection how can the partless supreme self have any limb fragment or part if it has limbs then there arises the contingency of its becoming destroye d through the dismemberment of the limbs reply this fault does not arise since its fragment which is delimited by an adjunct arising out of ignorance is imagined to be a part as it were and this idea has been fully explained in the chapter 13 deal ing with the field how that individual soul imagined as a part of mine enters into the world and leaves the body are being stated karsati it draws to itself indriyani the sense organs ear etc manah sasthani which have the mind as their sixth and prakrti sthani which abide in nature which are located in their respective spheres such as the orifice of the ear etc when does it draw the organs 158 when the master leaves it and even when he assumes a body he departs taking these as wi nd carries away odours from their receptacles english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda623 158 yat when isvarah the master of the aggregate of the body etc the individual soul utkramati leaves the body then he draws thus the second quarter of the verse is treated first for the sake of consistency when the soul leaves the body then it draws the organs see previous verses from that body in this way the second quarter of the present verse is treated first because going to another body follows the leaving of the earlier one ms ca api and even yat when it avapnoti assumes a body other than the earlier one then grahitva taking etani these the organs with the mind as their sixth samyati he leaves goes away totally samyak totally without returning in any way to the earlier body ms like what in reply the lord say s iva as vayuh the wind carries away gandhan odours asayat from their receptacles flowers etc which again are those organs 159 this one enjoys the objects by presiding over the ear eyes skin and tongue as also the nose and the mind english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda624 159 seated in the body it upasevate enjoys visayan the objects sound etc adhisthaya by presiding over srotram the ear caksuh eyes sparsanam skin the or gan of touch rasanam tongue eva ca as also the ghranam nose and manah the mind the sixth presiding over each one of them along with its corresponding organ 1510 persons who are diversely deluded do not see it even when it is leaving or r esiding in this body or experiencing or in association with the qualities those with the eye of knowledge see english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1510 thus the embodied soul utkarmantam when it is leaving the body the body that was assumed earlier or sthitam while residing in the present body or bhunjanam experiencing sound etc or guna anvitam in association with ie identified with the qualities called happiness sorrow and delusion even when under such conditions this one comes very much within the range of cognition vimudhah the persons who are diversely deluded as a result of their hearts being forcibly attracted by the enjoyments of seen and625 unseen objects na do not anu pasyanti see and the lord regrets this saying alas how sorrowful this is those others again jnana caksusah who have the eye of knowledge jnana caksuh means the scriptures supported by reasoning which are the means of knowledge who have the ins ight of under standing which has arisen from the valid means of knowledge ie those having a clear vision pasyanti see this one 1511 and the yogis who are diligent see this one as existing in themselves the non discriminating ones who lack self control do not see this one though they be diligent english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1511 and some however yoginah the yogis of concentrated minds yatantah who are diligent pasyanti see e vam this one the self under discussion as avasthitam existing atmani in themselves in their own intelligence they realize i am this acetasah the non discriminating ones akrta atmanah who lack self control who have not purified themselves th rough austerity and control of the organs who have not desisted from bad626 conduct who are not tranquil and are proud by nature na do not pasyanti see enam this one api though they be yatantah diligent even though they be striving with the help of the valid means of knowledge such as the scriptures with a view to speaking of the all pervasiveness of the state and the fact of its being the substratum of all empirical dealings the lord speaks in brief through the following four verses of the div ine manifestations of that state which the light of fire sun etc do not illumine though they are the illuminators of everything and reaching which the aspirants of liberation do not return again towards mundane existence and of which state the individ ual souls owing to their conformity with the diversity of limiting adjuncts are parts just as spaces enclosed in pot etc are parts of space 1512 that light in the sun which illumines the whole world that which is in the moon and that which is in fire know that light to be mine english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1512 yat that which is aditya gatam in the sun which abides in the sun what is that the tejah627 light brilliance radiance which bhasayate illumines reveals akhilam the whole entire jagat world yat that ulluminating light which is candramasi in the moon ca and yat which is agnau in fire the carrier of oblations viddhi know tat that tejah light to be mamakam mine that light belong to me who am visnu or the light that is consciousness which is in the sun which is in the moon and which is in fire know that light to be mine that light belongs to me who am visnu objectio n is it not that the light that is consciousness exists equally in the moving and the nonmoving such being the case why is this particular mention that light in the sun whichetc reply this defect does not arise because owing to the abundance of the sattva quality there can be an abundane ast reads avistaratva amplitude in place of adhikya tr of consciousness since in the sun etc the sattva is very much in evidence is greatly brilliant therefore there is an abundance of the light of consciousness in them alone and so it sun etc is specially mentioned but it is not that it consciousness is abundant only there indeed as in the world a face though in the same position is not reflected in wood a wall etc but in a mir ror etc it is reflected according to the degree in which628 they are more and more transparent so is it here further 1513 and entering the earth i sustain the beings through my power and nourish all the plants by becoming soma according to s and most other translators soma means the moon tr which is of the nature of sap english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1513 ca and avisya entering gam the earth aham i dharayami sustain bhutani the beings the world

earth i sustain the moving and non moving beings more over pusnami i nourish i make healthy and full of the sweet flavour of juices sarvah all osadhih the plants paddy barley etc bhutva by629 becoming somah soma rasatmakah which is of the nature of sap soma consists of all the juices it is the source of all juices indeed it nourishes all plants by infusing its own juice into everything besides 1514

originator of the vedanta ie the source of the traditional school of the teachings of vedanta and aham eva i myself am the veda vit knower of the vedas the knower of the teachings of the vedas in the verses beginning with that light in the sun which 12 etc have been stated briefly the majesty of god the lord called naravana which arise from special limiting adj uncts now then the succeeding verses are begun with a view to determining the real nature of that very lord as the unconditioned and absolute by distinguishing him from the limiting adjuncts viz the mutable and the immutable in that connection afte r dividing into three parts the two limiting adjuncts the mutable and the immutable and the supreme self all the teachings of the preceding and the immediately succeeding chapters the lord says 1516 there are these two persons in the world the mutable and the immutable the mutable consists of all things the one existing as maya is called the immutable632 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1516 there are imau these dvau two grouped separat ely purusau persons so called persons so called only figuratively since they are the limiting adjuncts of the supreme person loke in the world the ksarah mutable one group consists of the perishable the other person is the aksarah immutable op posite of the former the power of god called maya which is the seed of the origin of the person called the mutable that which is the receptacle of the impressions of desires actions etc of countless transmigrating creatures is called the immutable pe rson who are those persons the lord himself gives the answer ksarah the mutable consists of sarvani all bhutani things ie the totality of all mutable things kutasthah is the one existing as maya kuta means a heap kutasthah is that which exis ts like a heap or kuta is maya deception falsehood crookedness which are synonymous that which exists in the diverse forms of maya etc is the kutasthah it is ucyate called the aksarah immutable because owing to the countless seeds of worldly existence it does not perish633 1517 but different is th supreme person who is spoken of as the transcendental self who permeating the three worlds upholds them and is the imperisahble god english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1517 tu but anyah different entirely contrary in characteristics from these is the uttamah supreme most excellent purusah person who is different in character istics from these the mutable and the immutable untouched by the mutable and the immutable limiting adjuncts and is by nature eternal pure conscious and free udahrtah spoken of in the upanisads iti as the paramatma supreme self he is paramah s upreme as compared with the selves like body etc created by ignorance and is the atma self the inmost consciousness of all beings hence he is the supreme self he himself is being specially described yah who by dint of his own active power inherin g in the energy that is maya caitanya consciousness itself is the bala energy the sakti active power therein is maya through that he upholds avisya permeating loka trayam634 the three worlds called bhuh earth bhuvah intermediate space and svah heaven bibharti upholds them by merely being present in his own nature and he is the avyayah imperishable isvarah god the omniscient one called narayana who is the lord by nature this name the supreme person of god as described is well known showing that the name is apt by virtue of its etymological significance the lord reveals himself saying i am the unsurpassable god 1518 since i am transcendental to the mutable and above even the immutable hence i am well known in the wo rld and in the vedas as the supreme person english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1518 yasmat since aham i am atitah transcendental ksaram to the mutable i am beyond the tree of maya called the pe epul tree which this worldly existence is and uttamah above most excellent or the highest as compared with api even the akasarat immutable which is the seed of the tree of worldly existence atah635 hence by virtue of being the most excellent as compared with the mutable and the immutable aham i am prathitah well known loke in the world and vede in the vedas as purusottamah the supreme person devoted persons know me thus and poets also use this name purusottama in their poetry etc th ey extol me with this name thereafter now is stated this result attained by one who knows the self as described 1519 o scion of the bharata dynasty he who being free from delusion knows me the supreme person thus he is all knowing and adores me with his whole being english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1519 bharata o scion of the bharata dynasty yah he who asammudhah being free from delusion janati knows mam me god having the aforesa id qualifications purusottamam the supreme person evam thus in the way described as i am this one sah he is sarva vit all knowing he knows everything through self identification with all ie he becomes omniscient and bhajati adores mam me existing in all things sarva bhavena with his whole being ie with his mind fixed on me as the636 self of all now then having stated in this chapter the knowledge of the real nature of the lord which has liberation as its fruit it is being eulig ized 1520 o sinless one this most secret scripture has thus been uttered by me understanding this one becomes wise and has his duties fulfilled o scion of the bharata dynasty english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swam i gambhirananda 1520 this guhyatamam most secret ie most mystical what is that sastram scripture although the gita as a whole is spoken of as the scripture still this chapter itself is here referred to as such and this for eulogy as is evide nt from the context for not only has the entire meaning of the scripture gita been stated here in brief but the whole purport of the vedas also has been comprehended here and it has been said he who realizes it is a knower of the vedas 1

of as two creations of beings which accords with the upanisadic text there were two classes of prajapatis sons the gods and the demons br 131 for asmin in this loke world all persons can rationally be divided into two classes which are those two creations of beings the answer is the two are the daiva divine eva ca and the asur a the demoniacal which are being discussed the lord speaks of the need of restating the two that have been already referred to daivah the divine creation of beings proktah has been spoken of vistarasah elaborately in fearlessness purity of mind etc 1 3 but the demoniacal

qualities the triplet under which are comprehended all the different demoniacal qualities though they are infinite in number and by the avoidance of which three they all the demaniacal qualities become657 rejected and which is the root of all evils is being stated 1621 this door of hell which is the destroyer of the soul is of three kinds passion anger and also greed therefore one should

atmanah of the soul is trividham of three kinds it is that by the mere entry into which the soul perishes ie it ceases to be fit for attaining any human goal hence it is said that it is the door which is the destroyer of the soul which is that kamah pas sion krodhah anger and also lobhah greed tasmat therefore tyajet one shoud forsake etat trayam these three since this door is the destroyer of the soul therefore one should renounce this group of three passion etc this is a eulogy of renunciat ion 1622 o son of kunti a person who is free from these three doors to darkness strives for the good of the soul thereby he attains the highest goal658 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1622 o so n of kunti narah a person who is vimuktah free etaih from

the param suprme gatim goal ie liberation as well not only does he attain liberation by renouncing the demoniacal qualities but he also secures happiness in this world the scripture is instrumental in this complete renunciation of the demoniacal qualities and striving for what is good both can be undertaken on the authority of the scriptures not otherwise hence 1623 ignoring the precept of the scriptures he who acts under the impulsion of passion he does not attain perfection nor happiness nor the supreme goal659 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1623 utsrjiya ignoring setting aside sastra vidhim the precept of the scriptures which is th source of the knoweldge of what is duty and what is not called injunction and prohibition yah

arhasi you ought kartum to p erform it iha here here is used for pointing out the sphere in which one is intitled to perform his duties661 chapter 17 171 arjuna said but but is used to present a standpoint distinct from the earlier ones understand from 1623 4s o krsna what is the state ie where do the rites undertaken by them end of those who endued with faith adore adore perform sacrifices distribute wealth etc in honour of gods and others by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures is it sattva rajas or tamas english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 171 tu but of krsna ka what is the nistha state tesam of those whosoever they may be ye who being anvitah endued sraddhaya with faith with the idea that there is something hereafter yajante adore gods and others utsriya by ignoring set ting aside sastra vidhim the unjunctions of the scriptures the injunctions of the vedas and the smrtis is the state of those who are such sattvam sattva aho or rajah rajas or tamah tamas this is what is meant does the adoration of gods and others that they undertake come under the category of sattva or rajas or tamas by those who662 endued with faith adore by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures are here meant those who not finding any injunction which can be characterized as enjoined by the vedas or enjoined by the smrtis worship gods and others by merely observing the conduct of their elders but on the other hand those who though aware of some scriptural injunction discard them and worship the gods and others in ways contrar y to the injunctions are not meant here by those who ignoring scriptural injunctions adore why because of the qualifying phrase being endued with faith for it cannot be imagined that even when they are aware of some scriptural injunction abou t worship of gods and others they discard this out of their faithlessness and yet they engage in the worship of gods and others enjoined by those scriptures by becoming imbued with faith therefore by those who endued with faith adore by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures are here meant those very ones mentioned earlier an answer to this question relating to a general topic cannot be given without splitting it up hence 172 the blessed lord said that faith of the embodied beings bo rn of their own nature is663 threefold born of sattva rajas and tamas hear about it english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 172 sa that sraddha faith the state about which you ask dehinam of the embo died beings svabhavaja born of their own nature by svabhava nature is meant that latent impression of virtuous acts etc acquired in the past lives which becomes manifest at the time of death what arises out of that is svabhavaja is trividha three fold of three kinds sattviki born of sattva and related to worship of gods etc rajasi born of rajas concerning worship of yaksas a class of demi gods kubera and others raksas ogres nairrti and others and tamasi born of tamas concerning worship of ghosts goblins and others thus it is of three kinds srnu hear tam about it that faith as it is being stated that faith is threefold as follows 173 o scion of the bharata dynasty the faith of all beings is in accordance with thei r minds this person is made up of faith as the dominant factor he is verily what his faith is664 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 173 o scion of the bharata dynasty the sraddha faith sarvasya of all beings bhavati is sattva anurupa in accordance with their minds in accordance with the internal organ which is imbued with particular impression if this is so what follows the answer is ayam this purusah person the transmigrating soul is sraddhamayah made up of faith as the dominating factor how sah he the individual soul is eva verily sah that yah yat sraddhahwhich is the faith of that individual he surely conforms to his faith and as a consequence a persons steadfastness i n sattva etc is to be inferred from the grounds of his actions such as worship of gods etc hence the lord says 174 those having the sattva quality worship the gods those having rajas the demi gods and ogres and other people possessed of tamas wor ship ghosts and the hosts of spirits english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda665 174 sattvikah those having the sattva quality those steadfast in sattva yajante worship devan the gods rajasah those hav ing rajas worship yaksa raksamsi the demi gods and ogres and anye other janah people tamasah possessed of tamas yajante worship pretan ghosts and bhuta ganan the hosts of spirits sapta matrkas the seven mothers and others thus in the co ntext of abandonment of scriptural injunctions the states of sattva etc have been determined through their effects as regards that it is only one in thousands who being established in sattva becomes devoted to the adoration of gods but to be sure creatures are mostly rooted deeply in rajas or tamas how 175 those persons who given to ostentation and pride and possessed of passion attachment and strength undertake severe austerities not sanctioned in the scriptures english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 175 ye those janah persons who tapyante undertake perform ghoram severe tapah austerity productive of pain to oneself as also to creatures asastra vihitam not sanctioned by the scriptures they being dambh ahankara666 samyuktah given to ostentation

mam me antah sarira stham who reside in the body as the witness of its actions and intellect nonadherence to my injunctions itself is torturing me viddhi know tan them asura niscayan as possessed of demoniacal convictions know them so that they may b e avoided this is an instruction the liking of persons possessing the qualities of sattva rajas and tamas for foods that are divided into three groups viz succulent oleaginous etc is667 respectively being shown here so that by knowing the presence of the qualities of sattva rajas and tamas in oneself from the indications of the degree of ones preference for particular foods as are succulent oleaginous etc one may avoid foods having the characteristics of rajas and tamas and accept food with t he characteristics of sattva similarly sacrifices etc also are being explained here under three categories according to the distinguishing quality of sattva etc so that one may reject those known to be born of rajas and tamas and undertake only those born of sattva 177 food also which is dear to all is of three kinds and so also are sacrifices austerity and charity listen to this classification of them english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 177 aharah food api tu also which is priyah dear sarvasya to all here ast adds praninah creatures tr who eat it bhavati is trividhah of three

english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1710 bhojanam food which is yata yamam not properly cooked yata yamam lit means crooked three hours ago that which has

comme ntary swami gambhirananda 1712 tu but yat that which is ijyate performed abhisandhaya having in view a phalam result api ca as also dambhartham for ostentation viddhi know tam that yajnam sacrifice to be rajasam done through rajas bharatasrestha o greatest among the descendants of bharata 1713 they declare that sacrifice as done through tamas which is contrary to injunction in which food is not distributed in which mantras are not used in which offerings are not made t o priests and which is devoid of faith english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda672 1713 paricaksate they delclare that yajnam sacrifice as tamasam done through tamas which is vidhi hinam contrary to in junction opposed to what is enjoined asrstannam in which food is not distributed a sacrifice in which food annam is not distributed asrstam to brahmanas mantra hinam in which mantras are not used which is bereft of mantras intonation and distinc t pronunciation adaksinam in which offerings are not made to priests as prescribed and which is sraddha virahitam devoid of faith after that now is being stated the three kinds of austerity 1714 the worship of gods twice borns venerable person s and the wise purity straightforwardness celibacy and non injury are said to be bodily austerity english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1714 deva dvija guru pujanam the worship of gods twice borns venerable persons and the wise saucam purity arjavam straightforwardness brahmacarayam celibacy and ahimsa non injury ucyate are said to be sariram bodily tapah673 austerity austerity accomplished through the body that which can be performed by the agent etc see 18 13 15tr ie with the whole group of body and organs in which the body predominates for the lord will say these five are its causes 1815 1715 that speech which causes no pain which is true agreeable and ben eficial as well as the practice of study of the scriptures is said to be austerity of speech english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1715 yat that vakyam speech anudvegakaram which causes no pain which is not hurtful to creatures which is satyam true priya hitam agreeable and beneficial with regard to facts seen or unseen speech is qualified by characteristics such as bein g not hurtful etc the ca and is used for grouping together the qualifying characteristics when a sentence is used in order to make another understand if it happens to be avoid of one or two or three among the qualities truthfulness agreeability ben eficialness and non hurtfulness then it is not austerity of speech as in674 the case of a truthful utterance there would occur a want of austerity of speech if it be lacking in one or two or three of the others so also in the case of an agreeable utteran ce there would be no austerity of speech were it ot be without one or two or three of the others and similarly there would be no austerity of speech even in a beneficial utterance which is without one or two or three of the others what again is that a usterity of speech that utterance which is true as also not hurtful and is agreeable and beneficial is the highest austerity of speech as for example the utterance be calm my boy practise study and yoga thereby you will gain the highest svadh yaya abhyasanam the practice of the study of scriptures as is enjoined ca eva as well ucyate in said to be tapah austerity vanmayam of speech 1716 tranquillity of mind gentleness reticence withdrawal of the mind purity of heart these a re what is called mental austerity english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1716 manah prasadah tranquillity of mind making the mind free from anxiety saumyatvam675 gentleness that which is called kindline ss of spirit kindliness towards all and also not entertaining any evil thought towards anybody a certain condition of the mind resulting in calmness of the face etc maunam reticence since even the control of speech follows from the control of mind therefore the cause is implied by the effect so maunam means control of the mind or maunam may mean thinking of the self the attitude of a meditator the context being of mental austerity reticence is explained as control of the mind with regard to speech atma vinigrahah withdrawal of the mind withdrawal of the mind in a general way from everything maunam control of the mind is the minds withdrawal with regard to speech alone this is the distinction bhava samsuddhih purity of heart ab sence of trickery while dealing with others iti etat these are what is ucyate called manasam mental tapah austerity how the above described bodily verbal and mental austerities undertaken by poeple are divided into three classes of sattva etc is being stated 1717 when that threefold austerity is undertaken with supreme faith by people who do not hanker after results and are self controlled they speak of it as born of sattva676 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1717 when tat that trividham threefold based on three factors tapah austerity which is being discussed is taptam undertaken practised paraya with supreme with the highest sraddhaya faith belief in god and the other w orld naraih by people by its performers aphala akanksibhih who do not hanker after resultswho are devoid of desire for results and yuktaih who are self controlled that austerity which is of this kind the noble people paricaksate speak of it as sattvikam born of sattva 1718 that austerity which is undertaken for earning a name being honoured and worshipped and also ostentatiously that is spoken of as born of rajas belonging to this world uncertain and transitory english translation o f sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1718 yat that tapah austerity which is kriyate undertaken satkara mana pujartham for earning

rajas iha belonging to this world ie yielding fruits only in this world calam uncertain its result being unpredictable and adhruvam transitory 1719 t hat austerity which is undertaken with a foolish

commentary swami gambhirananda 1721 tu but the danam gift yat which diyate is made prati upakara artham expecting reciprocation with this purpose in view in time he will render service in return va

considered to be rajasam born of rajas 1722 the gift which is made at an improper place and time and to un deserving persons without proper treatment and with disdain is declared to be born of

brahman tai 181 tattvamasi thou art that ch 687 and sadeva somya idamagra asi t this was existence alone in the beginning o amiable one ch 621 in these texts brahman is indicated by the words om tat sat this is considered to be the threefold designation of brahman the brahmanas and vedas and the680 sacrifices were ordanine d by that in the days of yore english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1723 om tat sat iti this is smrtah considered regarded in the vedanta by the knowers of brahman to be the trividhah threefold nirdesah designation mention by name nirdesa is that by which a thing is specified brahmanah of brahman the brahmanas and the vedas and the sacrifices were vihitah ordainded when some defect arises in sacrifice etc then this is corrected by utt ering one of these words om tat sat created tena by that threefold designation pura in the days of yore in the beginning of creation by prajapati this is said by way of eulogizing the designation 1724 therefore acts of sacrifice charity and austerity as prescribed through injunctions of those who study and expound the vedas always commence after uttering the syllable om english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda681 1724 tasmat therefore yaj nadana tapah kriyah acts of sacrifice charity and austerity acts in the form of sacrifice etc vidhana uktah as prescribed through injunctions as ordained by the scriptures brahma vadinam of those who study and expound the vedas satatam always pravartante commence udahrtya after uttering om iti the syllable om 1725 after uttering the word tat acts of sacrifice and austerity as also the various acts of charity are performed without regard for results by persons aspiring for liberati on english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1725 after uttering the word tat which is a name of brahman yajna tapah kriyah acts of sacrifice and austerity ca as also vividhah the various dana kriyah acts of charity such as gift of land gold etc kriyante are performed anabhisandhaya without regard for phalam results of actions moksa kanksibhih by persons aspiring for liberation the use of the words om682 and tat has been stated thereafter the use of the word sat is bieng presently stated 1726 this word sat is used with regard to something coming into being and with regard to someone becoming good so also o son of prtha the word sat is used with regard to an auspicious rite english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1726 et at this sat iti word sat a name of brahman prayujyate is used is uttered sad bhave with regard to something coming into being with regard to coming into existence of something that was not there as for instance the birth of a son who was not th ere before so also sadhu bhave with regard to someone becoming good sadhu bhava means coming to possess good conduct by an evil person who had bad behaviour with regard to that tatha so also o son of prtha the sat sabdah word sat yujyate which is the same as prayujyate is used prasaste karmani with regard to an auspicious rite such as mirage etc683 1727 and the steadfastness in sacrifice austerity and charity is spoken of as sat and even the action meant for these is verily called as sat good english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1727 and sthitih steadfastness that is yajne in sacrifice in the act of sacrifice the steadfastness that is tapasi in austerity and the steadfas tness that is dane in charity that ucyate is spoken of sat iti as sat by learned persons and eva even the karma action tad arthiyam meant for these for sacrifice charity and austerity or for him whose names are under discussion ie for god is eva verily abhidhiyate called sat iti as sat good thus in this way the acts of sacrifice austerity etc even when they are devoid of sattva and goodness become good and endued with sattva by he use of the three names of brahman with faith and as regards those sacrifice etc since in all cases everything is performed with a predominance of faith therefore 1728 o son of prtha whatever is offered in sacrifice and given in charity as also whatever austerity is undertakne or whatev er is done684 without faith is said to be of on avail and it is of no consequence after death nor here english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1728 o son of prtha whatever is hutam offered in sacrifice poured as oblation and dattam given in charity to brahmanaswithout faith whatever tapah austerity is taptam performed without faith so also whatever is krtam done without faith eg praise salutation etc all that ucyate is said to be asat iti of no avail since it is outside th course of discipline leading to me ca and although involving great effort na ca tat it is of no consequence pretya after death for producing some result na nor even for any result iha because it is co ndemned by the wise thus it is established in this chapter that among persons who are not at all versed in the scriptures but are possessed of either of the three characterisitcs of sattva rajas etc only those shall attain to liberation who stea dfastly resort to sattva alone by partaking of sattvika food performing sattvika sacrifices etc to te exclusion of rajasika and tamasika food etc who destroy any defect that might arise in sacrifice etc by uttering the names of685 brahman who have fu lly purified their intellect and who have attained to the realization of truth arising from ones being endowed with such disciplines as hearing and and thinking sravana manana of and meditation nididhyasana on brahman686 chapter 18 181 arjuna said o mighty armed hrsikesa o slayer of the demon kesi i want to know serverally the truth about sannyasa as also about tyaga english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 181 o m ighty armed hrsikesa kesi nisudana o slayer of the demon kesi icchami i want veditum to know prthak severally through their mutual distinctions tattvam the truth the intrinsic nature ie the real meaning sannyasasya of sannyasa ie the meaning of the word sannyasa ca as also tyagasya of tyaga ie the meaning of the word tyaga kesi was a demon who had assumed the form of a horse and lord vasudeva had killed him hence he is addressed by that name kesi nisudana by arjuna the wor d sannyasa and tyaga used in various places in the preceding chapters are not explicit in their implications therefore in order to determine them for arjuna who had put the question687 182 the blessed lord said the learned ones know sannyasa to be the giving up of actions done with a desire for reward the adepts call the abandonment of the results of all works as tyaga english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 182 some kavayah learned ones viduh know sannyasam sannyasa the meaning of the word sannyasa the non performance of what comes as a duty to be the nyasam giving up karmanam of actions kamyanam done with a desire for reward eg horse sacrifice etc sarva karma phala tyagah aban donment of the results of all actions means the giving up of the results accruing to oneself from all actions the daily obligatory and the occasional nitya and naimittika that are performed vicaksanah the adepts the learned ones prahuh call speak of that as tyagam tyaga as the meaning of the word tyaga even if the giving up of actions for desired results or the abandonment of results be the intended meaning in either case the one meaning of the words sannyasa and tyaga amounts only to tya ga giving up they do not imply distinct categories as do the words pot and cloth objection well is it not688 that they say the daily obligatory nitya and the occasional naimittika rites and duties have no results at all how is the giving up of their results spoken of like the abandoning of a son of a barren woman reply this defect does not desire it is the intention of the lord that the nitya karmas daily obligatory duties also have results for the lord will say the threefold results of actions the undesirable the desirable and the mixed accrue after death to those who do not resort to tyaga and also but never to those who resort to sannyasa monks 12 indeed by showing that it is only in the case of sannyasins monks alone t hat there is no connection with the results of actions the lord asserts in accrue after death to those who do not resort to tyaga renunciation abid that the result of daily obligatory nitya duties accrue to those who are not sannyasins monk s 183 some learned persons say that action beset with evil as it is should be given up and others say that the practice of sacrifice charity and austertiy should not be given up english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda689 183 eke some manisinah learned ones subscribing to the views of the sankhyas and others prahuh say that dosavat beset with evil as it is what is it karma action all actions becuase they are the cause of bondage tyajyam should be given up even by those who are eligible for actions rites and duties or it action is to be given up dosavat just as defects such as attachment etc are renounced ca and in that very context apare others say that yajana dana tapah karma the practice of sacrifice charity and auterity na tyajyam should not be given up these alternatives are with regard to only those who are qualified for action but not with regar d to the monks who are steadfast in knowledge and have gone beyond the stages of life this discussion is not concerned with those who are held to be outside the scope of eligibility for action in the assertion by the lord the steadfastness in the yoga of knowledge by men of realization was spoken of by me in the days of yore see 33 objection well just as those who are qualified for rites and duties and who have their distinct steadfastness are being considered here in the chapter summarizing the entire scripture though they have been dealt with earlier in through the yoga of action for the yogis 33 similarly let690 even the men of realization who are steadfast in knowledge be considered here reply no because it is not logical that thei r renunciation should result from delusion and sorrow cf 7 and 8 the men of realization do not perceive in the self the sorrows arising from physical torment for it has been shown that desire etc are attributes only of the field body see 136 th erefore they do not renounce action but of fear for physical trouble and pain nor do they perceive actions in the self on account of which they should give up obligatory duties out of delusion in fact they renounce with the conviction that action bel ongs to the organs see 328 i certainly do not do anything see 58 for the mode of renunciation of an enlightened person was shown in having given up all actions mentally 513 therefore those others who are qualified for rites and dutie s who are unelightened about the self and for whom renunciation is possible out of delusion and from fear of physical trouble are alone condemned as persons who being possessed of tamas and rajas resort to renunciation and this is done with a veiw to eulogizing the renunciation of the results of rites and duties by the unenlightened men of action besides the men of renunciation in the real sense have been particularly pointed out in who has691 renounced ever undertaking who is silent content with anything homeless steadyminded 1216 19 and also while determining the characteristics of one who has transcended the gunas chapter 14 the lord will further say which is the supreme consummation of knowledge 50 therefore the monks ste adfast in knowledge are not intended to be spoken of here it is only the abandoning of the results of action which by virtue of its being imbued with the quality of sattva is spoken of as sannyasa in contrast to the renunciation of actions which is poss essed of tamas etc it is not sannyasa in the primary sense the renunciation of all actions objection according to the reason shown in the text since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely 11 may it not be ar gued that the actions entirely 11 may it not be argued that the word sannyasa is certainly used in the primary sense because it is impossible to abandon all works reply no for the next adducing the reason is meant for eulogy just as from renuncia tion immediately follows peace 1212 is a mere eulogy of renunciation of the fruits of action it having been enjoined on arjuna who was unenlightened and incapable of undertaking the various alternatives paths as692 stated earlier so also is this se ntence since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely 11 meant for eulogizing the renunciation of the resorts of all actions no one can point an exception to the proposition that having given up all actions ment ally the embodied man of self control continues happilywithout doing or causing others to do anything at all see 513 therefore these alternative veiws regarding sannyasa and tyaga are concerned only with those who are qualified for rites and d uties but the enlightened ones who have realized the supreme truth are competent only for steadfastness in knowledge which is characterized by renunciation of all actions not for anything else hence they do not come within the purview of the alternati ve veiws thus has this been pointed out by us in connection with the text he who knows this one as indestructible 221 as also in the beginning of the third chapter 184 o the most excellent among the descendants of bharata hear from me t he firm conclusion regarding that tyaga for o greatest among men tyaga has been clearly declared to be of three kinds693 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 184 bharata sattama o the most excellent am ong the descendants of bharata srnu hear understand me from me from my statement niscayam the firm conclusion tatra tyage regarding that tyaga regarding these alternative veiws on tyaga and sannyasa as they have been shown hi for purusavyaghr a o greatest among men tyagah tyaga samprakirtitah has been clearly declared has been distinctly spoken of in the scriptures to be trividhah of three kinds threefold under the classes of tamasa those based on tamas tamas darkness mental darkn ess ignorance one of the three qualities of everything in nature also see 148 and note under 245 tr etc the lord has used the word tyaga with the idea that the primary meanings of tyaga and sannyasa are verily the same since it is difficult t o comprehend this idea that the primary meanings of the words tyaga and sannyasa can be threefold under the classification based on tamas etc in the case of one who is unenlightened and who is qualified for rites and duties but not in the case of one who has realized the supreme goal therefore no one else is capable of speaking the truth in this connection694 hence listen to the firm conclusion of the lord with regard to the supreme truth as revealved by the scriptures which again is this firm conclusi on in reply the lord says 185 the practice of sacrifice charity and austerity is not to be abandoned it is surely to be undertaken sacrifice charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 185 yajna dana tapah karma the practice of sacrifice charity and austerity this threefold practice na tyajyam is not to be abandoned tat it is eva surely karyam to be undertaken why yajnah sacrific e danam charity and tapah austerity are eva verily pavanani the purifiers the causes of sanctification manisinam of the wise ie of those who do not seek results for themselves 186 but even these actions have to be undertaken by renounci ng attachment and hankering for results this is my firm and best conclusion o parhta695 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 186 tu but api even etani these karmani actions viz sacrifice chari ty and austerity which have been spoken of as purifiers kartavyani have to be undertaken tyaktva by renouncing sangam attachment to them and by giving up hankering for their phalani results iti this is me my niscitam firm and uttamam bes t matam conculsion having promised hear from me the firm conclusion regarding that tyaga 4 and also adduced the reason that they are purifiers the utterance even these actions have to be performed this is the firm and best conclusion is only by way of concluding the promised subject matter this sentence does not introduce a fresh topic for it stands to reason that the phrase even these refers to some immediate topic under discussion the implication of the word api even is even these acts which are causes of bondage to one who has attachment and who hankers after their results have to be undertaken by a seeker of liberation but the phrase even these is not used in relation to other acts others explain thus since the nityakar mas have no results therefore in their case it is illogical to say by giving up696 attachment and hankering for their results the meaning of the phrase etani api even these is that even these rites and duties which are undertaken for desired res ults and are different from the nityakarmas have to be undertaken what to speak of the nityakarmas like sacrifice charity and austerity reply this is wrong since it has been established by the text sacrifice charity and austerity are verily the purifiers that even the nityakarmas have results for a seeker of liberation who wants to give up even the nityakarmas from fear of their being causes of bondage how can there be any association with actions done for desired results moreover the phras e etani api cannot apply to actions done for desired results kamyakarmas since they have been denigrated in indeed actions is quite inferior 249 and in by actions other than that action meant for god 39 and since on the strength of the texts which support the two earlier arguments the vedas have the three qualities as their object 245 those who are versed in the vedas who are drinkers of somapray for the heavenly goal by worshipping me 920 and they enter into the human world on the exhaustion of their merit 921 it has been definitely stated that actions done for desired results are causes of697 bondage and also because they are far removed from the context 187 the abandoning of daily obligatory acts nityakamas is not justifiable giving up that through delusion is declared to be based on tamas english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 187 therefore sannyasah the abandoning niyatasya tu karmanah of the daily obligatory acts by the seeker of liberation who is as yet unenlightened and is fit for rites and duites na apapadyate is not justifiable because what is desired is the purification of unenlightened persons parityagah giving up tasya of th at of the daily obligatory duty mohat through delusion through ignorance parikirtitah is declared to be tamasah based on tamas niyata is that duty which must be performed that an act is niyata obligatory and it is relinquished is contradictory therefore the giving up of that through delusion is declared to be based on tamas for delusion is tamas besides698 188 whatever action one may relinquish merely as being painful from fear of physical suffering he having resorted to renunciation based on rajas will surely not acquire the fruits of renunciation english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 188 yat whatever karma action tyajet one may relinquish eva merely iti as being kuhkham painful as being impossible to accomplish kaya klesa bhayat from fear of physical suffering out of fear of bodily p ain sah he krtva having resorted tyagam to renunciation rajasam based on rajas arising from rajas will eva surely na labhet shuld rather be labhate not acquire tyaga phalam fruits of renunciation the result called liberation which follow s from renunciation of all actions as a consequence of illumination which again is the renunciation based on sattva 189 whatever obligatory duty is performed just because it is a bounden duty o arjuna by giving up attachment and the result as we llthat renunciation is considered to be based on sattva699 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 189 yat whatever niyatam karma daily obligatory duty kriyate is performed accomplished iti eva just because it is karyam a bounden duty o arjuna tyaktva by giving up sangam attachment and phalam the result ca eva as well sah that tyagah renunciation giving up of attachment and hankering for the resutls of daily obligatory duties matah is considered to be sattvikah based on sattva arising from sattva we said that the lords utterance is proof of the fruitfulness of daily obligatory duties or even if the niyakarmas be understood from the lords worlds to be fruitless still the ignorant man does certainly imagine that the nityakarmas daily obligatory duites when performed produce for oneself a result either in the form of purification of the mind or avoidance of evil as to this the lord aborts even that imagination by saying by giving up the result hence it has been well said by giving up attachment and the result objection well is not the threefold relinquishment of actions also called sannyasa under discussion as regards this the renunciation based on tamas and rajas have been stated why is the relinquishment of700 attachment and desire for their results spoken of here as the third this is like somebody saying three brahmanas have come of them two are versed in the six auxiliaries the six auxiliaries are siksa phonetics kalpa code of rituals and sacrifices vyakarana grammar nirukta etymology chandas meter prosody and jyotisa astronomy tr of the vedas the third is a ksatirya reply this is not wrong for this is meant as a eulogy on t he basis of the common factor of renunciation between renunciation of actions and renunciation of hankering for results there is indeed the similarity of the fact of renunciation while on this subject by condemning renunciation of actions on accou nt of its being based on rajas and tamas the renunciation of desire for results of actions is being praised on account of its being based on sattva by saying that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva the internal organ of a person who i s qualified for rites and duties who performs the nityakarmas by giving up attachment and hankering for results becomes pure on account of its being untainted by attachment to results etc and refined by the nitya karmas when it is pure and tranquil it becomes capable of contemplating on the self since for that very person whose701 internal organ has become purified by performing the nityakarmas and who has become ready for the knowledge of the self the process by which he can become steadfast in it has to be stated therefore the lord says 1810 the man of renunciation who has become imbued with sattva who is wise and freed from doubts does not hate unbefitting action nor does he become attached to befitting activity english translation of sr i sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1810 na devesti he does not hate akusalam unbefitting karma action rites and duties meant for desired results with the idea what is the usefulness of this which is a cause of transmigra tion through fresh embodiment na anusajjate he does not become attached to kusale befitting activity daily obligatory duties by thinking that this is the cause of liberation by virtue of its being the cause of purification of the mind rise of knowl edge and steadfastness in it that is to say he does not entertain any liking even for it because he finds no purpose in it who again is he tyagi the man of renunciation who702 has become so by having given up attachment and rewards of action in the m anner stated above he is a tyagi who performs nityakarmas by relinquishing attachment to those acts and their results again it is being stated as to when that person does not hate an unbefitting act and does not become attached to a befitting activity when he has become sattva samavistah imbued with sattva ie when he is filled with possessed of sattva which is the means to the knowledge that discriminates between the self and the not self and hence medhavi wise endowed with intelligence med ha intuitive experience characterized as knowledge of the self one possessed of that is medhavai wise and owing to the very fact of being wise chinnasamsayah freed from doubts one whose doubts created by ignorance have been sundered one who is f reed from doubts by his firm conviction that nothing but abiding in the ture nature of the self is the supreme means to the highest good the person competent for rites and duties who having gradually become purified in mind through the practice of karm ayoga in the way described above has realized as his own self the actionless self which is devoid of modifications like birth etc he having given up all actions mentally703 remaining at without doing or causing others to do anything at all cf 513 attains steadfastness in knowledge which is characterized as actionless ness in this way the purpose of the aforesaid karma yoga has been stated through the present verse on the other hand since for the unenlightened person who while being qualified for rites and duties holds on to the body owing to the erroneous conception that the body is the self and who has the firm conviction i am the agent because of the persistence of his idea that the self is the agent it is not possible to r enounce actions totally therefore he has competence only for performing enjoined duties by giving up fruits of actions but he is not to renounce them actions in order to point out this idea the lord says 1811 since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely therefore he on the other hand who renounces results on actions is called a man of renunciation english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1811 deha bhrta f or one who holds on to a body one who maintains bibharti a body deha is704 called a deha bhrt one who has self indentification with the body is called a deha bhrt but not a so a man of discrimination for he has been excluded from the eligibility for ag entship by such texts as he who knows this one is indestructible etc hence for that unenlightened person who holds on to the body he since it is na not sakyam possible tyaktum to give up renounce karmani actions asesatah entirely totally therefore the ignorant person who is competent for rites and duties yah who tu on the other hand karma phala tyagi renounces results of actions relinquishes only the hankering for the results of actions while performing the nityakarmas sah he is abhidhiyate called tyagi iti a man of renunciation even though he continues to be a man of rites and duties this is said by way of eulogy therefore total renunciation of actions is possible only for one who has realized the supreme truth who d oes not hold on to the body and who is devoid of the idea that the body is the self again what is that purpose which is accomplished through renunciation of all actions this is being stated 1812 the threefold results of actions the undesirable t he desirable and the mixed accrues705 after death to those who do not resort to renunciation but never to those who resort to monasticism english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1812 these trividham threefold of three kinds phalam results karmanah of actions characterized as the righteous and the unritheous anistam the undesirable consisting in birth in hell among animals etc istam the desirable consisting in birth as gods and others and misram the mixed having a mixture of the desirable and the undesirable consisting in birht as human beings these results that are of these kinds bhavati accrues pretya after death after the fall of the body atyagin am to those who do not resort to renunciation to the unilllumined the men with rites and duties who are not men of renunciation in the truest sense the derivative sense of the word phala pha la is this on accunt of being accomplished through the op eration of diverse external accessories and a result of ignorance comparable to the charm cast by jugglery a source of great delusion and appearing as though close to the indwelling self it is phalgu unsubstantial706 and as a consequence it undergoes l ayam disappearance the result that is of this kind accrues to those who do not resort to renunciation tu but na kvacit never sannyasinam to those who resort tomonasticism for the sake of the highest reality to the class of monks called paramaha msas who remain steadfast in knowledge alone for it cannot be that those who are devoted wholly to steadfastness in complete enlightenment do not dig out the seed of transmigration this is the meaning therefore it is only for those who have realized th e supreme truth that it is possible to become a monk who renounces actions totally because action accessories and results are superimmpositions on the self through ignorance but the renunciation of all actions is not possible for an unenlightened person who perceives the locus the body etc action agentship and accessories as the self this the lord shows in the following verses 1813 o mighty armed one learned from me these another reading is etani tr five factors for the accomplishment of all actions which have been spoken of in the vedanta in which actions terminate707 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1813 o mighty armed one nibodha learn me from me imani these panca five ka ranani factors accessories which are going to be stated for drawing the attention of his arjunas mind and for showing the difference among these categories categories locus body etc the lord praises those accessories in the succeeding verses as fit for being known siddhaye for the accomplishment sarva karmanam of all actions proktani which have been spoken of sankhye in vedanta sankhya is that scripture where the subject matters in the sentence thou art that the word thou means the individual self and that means brahman the comprehension of their unity and also hearing reflection and meditation are referred to as the subject matters to be known are fully samyak stated khyayante krtante in which actions terminate krta nte qualifies that very word vedanta krtam mean action that in which occurs the culmination anta of that krtam is krtantam ie the termination of actions in the texts as much utility as a man has in a well 246 and o son of prtha all ac tions in their totality culminate in knowledge 433 the lord708 shows the cessation of all actions when the knowledge of the self dawns hence it is said which have been spoken of in that vedanta where actions culminate and which is meant for the k nowledge of the self which are they this is being answered 1814 the locus as also the agent the different kinds of organs the many and distinct activities and the divine is here the fifth english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1814 adhisthanam the locus the body which is the seat the basis of the manifestation of desire hatred happiness sorrow knowledge etc tatha as also karta the agent the enjoyer the individual self which has intelligence etc as its limiting adjuncts due to which it appears to possess their characteristics and become identified with them who has assumed the characteristics of the limiting adjuncts prthak vidham the different kinds of karanam organs th e ears etc which twelve the five organs of knowledge eyes ears nose tongue and skin the five organs of actions hands feet speech organ of excertion and that of generation709 the mind and the intellect in number are of different kinds for the experience of sound etc the vividhah many and prthak distinct cesta activities connected with air exhalation inhalation etc ca eva and daivam the divine ie the sun and the others who are the presiding deities of the eye etc is atra her e in relation to these four pancamam the fifth completing the five 1815 whatever action a man performs with the body speech and mind be it just or its reverse of it these five are the cuases english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskri t commentary swami gambhirananda 1815 yat whatever karma action narah a man prarabhate performs with these three sarira van manobhih with the body speech and mind be it nyayyam just rigtheous conforming to the scriptures va or viparit am its reverse not conforming to the scriptures unrighteous and even such activities like closing the eyes etc whch are consequent on the fact of living ie instinctive acts they also are certainly the result of righteous and unrighteous acts done in earlier lives and hence they are understood by the very use of the710 words just and its reverse tasya of it of all activities without exception ete these panca five as mentioned are the hetavah causes objection well are not the locus etc the cause of all actions why is it said performs with the body speech and mind reply this fault does not arise all actions described as enjoined or prohibited are mainly based on the three body etc seeing hearing etc which are charac teristics of life and are subsidiaries to these body etc seeing etc are accomplished by the eye etc which are part and parcel of the body etc are divided into three groups and spoken of in performs with the body etc even at the time of reap ing the fruits of actions they are experienced mainly through these three hence there is no contradiction with the assertion that the five are the causes 1816 this being the case anyone who owing to the imperfection of his intellect percei ves the absolute self as the agent that man does not perceive properly and has a perverted intellect english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda711 1816 tatra is used for connecting with the topic under discu ssion tatra evam sati this being the case when actions are thus accomplished by the five causes mentioned above this portion has to be connected with perverted intellect by way of causality actions are done by the body etc but since a person think s that the self is the agent therefore he is said to have a perverted intellect yah tu anyone an unenlightened person who pasyati perceives kevalam the absolute pure atmanam self as the kartaram agent thinking i myself am the agent of the actions being done by them as a consequence of imagining the self as identified with them why akrta buddhitvat owing to the imperfection of his intellect owing to his intellect not having been refined by the instructions of vedanta and the teachers and by reasoning even the person who believing in the self as distinct from the body etc looks upon the distinct ast omits anyam distinct tr absolute self as the agent he too is surely of imperfect intellect hence owing to his having an imperfect intellect sah that man na does not pasyati perceive properly either the truth about the self or about actions this is the meaning therefore he is a durmatih man of perverted intellect in the sense that his intellect is contemptible p erverse712 corrupted and the cause of repeatedly undergoing births and deaths he does not perceive even while seeing like the man suffering from timira seeing many moons or like one thinking the moon to be moving when actually the clouds are moving or like the one seated on some conveyance eg palanquin thinking oneself to be moving when others the bearers are moving who again is the man of right intellect who perceives correctly this is being answered 1817 he who has not the feeling of e goism whose intellect is not tainted he does not kill nor does he become bound even by killing these creatures english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1817 yasya he who the person whose intellect is refined by the instructions of the scriptures and the teachers and reason who has na not ahankrtah bhavah the feeling of egoism in whom does not occur the notion in the form i am the agent ie he who sees thus these five viz locus etc 14 imagined in the self through ignorance are verily the agents of all actions not i but i am the713 absolute unchanging witness of their functions without vita force without mind pure superior to the other superior immutable maya mu 211 yasya whose buddhih intellect the internal organ which is the limiting adunct of the self is na not lipyate tainted does not become regretful thinking i have done this as a result i shall enter into hell whose intellect does not become thus tainted he has a good intellect and he perceives rightly api even hatva by killing iman these lokan creatures ie all living beings sah he does not hanti kill he does not perform the act of killing nor does he nibadhyate become bound nor even does he become connected with its result the fruit of an unrighteous action objection even if this be a eulogy is it not contradictory to say even by killing he does not kill reply this defec t does not arise for this becomes logical from the ordinary and the enlightened points of view by adopting the empirical point of view which consists in thinking i am the slayer by identifying the body with the self the lord says even by killing and by taking his stand on the supreme truth as explained above the lord says he does not kill nor does he become bound thus both these surely become reasonable objection is it not that the self714 certainly does act in combination with the locus etc which conclusion follows from the use of the word kevala absolute in the text the absolute self as the agent 16 reply there is not such fault because the self being changeless by nature there is no possiblity of its becoming united with the locus etc for it is only a changeful entity that can possibly be united with another or come to have agentship through combination but for the changeless self there can be no combination with anything whatsoever hence agentship through combinatio n is not logical therefore the absoluteness of the self being natural the word kevalam is merely a reiteration of an established fact and the changelessness of the self is well known from the upanisads the smrtis and logic as to that in the gita its elf this has been established more than once in such texts as it is said thatthis is unchangeable 225 actions are being done by the gunas themselves see 327 this supreme self does not actalthough existing in the body 1331 and in the upanisads also in such texts as it thinks as it were and shakes as it were br 437 and from the standpoint of reason also the royal path is to hold that the true nature of the self is that it is partless independent of others and changele ss even if mutability of the self be715 accepted it should have a change that is its own the functions of the locus etc cannot be attributed to the agency of the self indeed an action done by someone else cannot be imputed to another by whom it has no t been done as for what is imputed on somebody through ignorance that is not his as the quality of silver is not of nacre or as surface or dirt attributed through ignorance to the sky by foolish people is not of the sky similarly the changes in the locus etc also are verily their own and not of the self hence it has been well said that the enlightened person does not kill nor is he bound becuase of the absence of his being tainted by the idea that actions are done by himself some translate this portion thus because of the absence of the thought i am doing and also due to the taintlessness of the mind or in the absence of egotism and of all taint in the mind tr after having declared this one does not kill nor is it kille d 219 having stated the immutability of the self through such texts as never is this one born 220 etc which adduce the reason for this having briefly stated at the commencement of the scripture in he who knows this one as indestructible 221 that the enlightened man has no eligibility for rites and duties and having deliberated in various places on that cessation716 which has been mooted in the middle of the scripture the lord by way of summarizing the purport of the scripture conc ludes here by saying that the enlightened person does not kill nor does he become bound if this be so then it becomes established that the three kinds of results of actions viz the undesirable etc do not accrue to the monks since it is reasonable that because of the illogicality of their entertaining the idea of being embodied all actions resulting from ignorance become abandoned by them and hence as a consequence of a reversal of this it becomes inevitable that the results do accrue to othe rs thus this is how the purport of the scripture gita has been summed up in order that this which is the essence of the teachings of all the vedas should be understood after deliberation by the learned ones possessing a sharp intellect it has been exp lained by us in accordance with the scriptures and reasoning in various places by dealing with it topically thereafter now is being stated what promts actions 1818 knowledge the object the knowledge and the knower this is the threefold inducement to action the comprehension of actions comes under three heads the instruments the object and the subject717 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1818 jnanam knowledge being derived in the sense of that through which something is known jnana means knowledge concerning all things in general so also jneyam the object of knowledge that also is a reference to all objects in general similarly parijnata the knower the experiencer a product o f ignorance who partakes of the nature of the limiting adjuncts thus this tripartite group formed by these is the trividha threefold karma codana inducement ot action inducer of all actions in general for it is when the three viz knowledge etc combine that commencement of all actions meant either for acceptance or rejection acceptance rejection or indifference are possible after that what are initiated by the five viz locus etc and are grouped in three ways according to the differences of their being based on speech mind and body become comprehended under the three viz instrument etc this is what is being stated karma sangrahah the comprehension it is well know that actions are based on the three instrument etc of actions iti c omes under trividhah three heads three classes viz karanam718 the instrument derived in the sense of that through which anything is done ie the external organs ear etc and the internal organs intellect etc karma the object derivative ly meaning that which is most cherished by the subject and is achieved through an act and karta the subject agent who employs the instrument etc who partakes of the nature of the limiting adjuncts sangrahah is derived thus that in which somethin g is comprehended the comprehension of action karma is karma sangrahah indeed action becomes included in these three hence is this threefold comprehension of action now then since action instrument and result are all constituted by the gunas it becomes necessary to state the three fold variety in them based on the differences among the gunas viz sattva rajas and tamas hence it is begun 1819 knowledge action and agent are stated in the teaching about the gunas to be only of three kinds according to the differences of the gunas hear about them also as they are english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda719 1819 jnanam knowledge karma action not the objective case in the technical sense whic h is defined as that which is most cheirshed by the subject and karta agent the accomplisher of actions procyate are stated guna sankhyane in the teaching about the gunas in the philosophy of kapila to be eva only only is used for emphasis by way of showing that they have no classification other than that based on the gunas tridha of three kinds guna bhedatah according to the differences of the gunas ie according to the differences of sattva etc even that philosophy teaching about t he gunas is certainly vaild so far as it concerns the experiencer of the gunas though it is contradictory so far as the non duality of the supreme reality brahman is concerned those followers of kapila are acknoweldge authorities in the ascertainment o f the functions of the gunas and their derivatives hence that scripture too is being referred to by way of eulogy of the subject matter going to be spoken of therefore there is no contradiction srnu hear tani about them api also yathavat as th ey are as established by reason and as propounded in the scriptures hear about knowledge etc and all their diversities created by the differences of the gunas the idea is concentrate your mind on the subject going to be720 taught and now the threefol d classification of knowledge is being stated 1820 know that knowledge to be originating from sattva through which one sees a single undecaying undivided entity in all the diversified things english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1820 viddhi know tat that jnanam knowledge realization of the self as non dual complete realization to be sattvikam originating from sattva yena through which knowledge iksate one sees ekam a single avyayam undecaying that which does not undergo mutation either in itself or by the mutation of its qualities ie eternal and immutable bhavam entity the word bhava is used to imply an entity ie the single reality which is the self sarvabhutesu in all things in all things begining from the unmanifest to the unmoving things and through which knowledge one sees that entity to be avibhaktam undivided in every body vibhaktesu in all the deversified things in the different bodies the idea is that re ality which is the self remains like space undivided being721 based on rajas and tamas those that are the dualistic philosophies are incomplete and hence are not by themselves adequate for the eradication of worldly existence 1821 but know that know ledge to be originating from rajas which amidst all things apprehends the different entities of various kinds as distinct as possessing distinct selves english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1821 tu but viddhi know tat that jnanam knowledge to be rajasam originating from rajas yat which sarvesu bhutesu amidst all things vetti apprehends since knowledge cannot be an agent of hends since knowledge cannot be an agent of action therefore t he meaning implied is that knowledgethrough which one apprehends nana bhavan the different entities prthagvidhan of various kinds ie those possessing diverse characteristics and different from oneself prthakrvena as distinct as separa te in each body 1822 but that knowledge is said to be born of tamas which is confined to one form as though it722 were all which is irrational not concern with truth and triivial english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1822 but tat that knowledge is udahrtam said to be tamasam born of tamas yat which is saktam confined ekasmin to one karye from to one body or to an exter nal image etc krtsnavat as though it were all as though it comprehended everything thinking the self or god is only this much there is nothing beyond it as the naked jainas hold that the soul conforms to and has the size of the body or as oth ers hold that god is merely a stone or wood remaining confined thus to one form ahaitukam which is irrational bereft of logic a tattvarthavat not concerned with truth tattvartha truth means some thing just as it is that knowledge which has thi s truth as its object of comprehension is tattvarthavat that without this is atattvarthavat and which on account of the very fact of its being irrational is alpam trivial because it is concerned with trifles or is productive of little result t his kind of knowledge is indeed found in non discriminating creatures in whom723 tamas predominates now is being stated the threehold division of action 1823 the daily obligatory action which is performed without attachment and without likes or dislike s by one who does not hanker for rewards that is said to be born of sattva english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1823 niyatam the daily obligatory karma action yat which is krtam performed sanga rahitam without attachment araga dvesatah without likes or dislikes aphala prepsuna by one who does not hanker for rewards by an agent who is the opposite of one who is desirous of the fruits of action tat that action ucyate is said to be sattvikam born of sattva 1824 but that action is said to be born of rajas which is done by one desirous of results or by one who is egotistic and which is highly strenuous english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambh irananda724 1824 but tat that karma action udahrtam is said to be rajasam born of rajas yat which is kriyate done kamepsuna by one desirous of results va or saahankarena by one who is egotistic and bahulaayasam which is highly strenuous accomplished by the agent with great effort egotistic is not used in contrast to knowledge of truth what then it is used in contrast to the absence of egotism in an ordinary person versed in the vedic path for in the case of the knower of the self w ho is not egotistic in the real sense there is no question of his being desirous of results or of being an agent of actions requiring great effort even of actions born of sattva the agent is one who has not realized the self and is possessed of egoism what to speak of actions born of rajas and tamas in common parlance a person versed in the vedic path even though not possessing knowledge of the self is spoken of as being free from egotism thus this brahmana is free from egotism therefore sahan karena va is said in contrast to him only punah again is used to complete the meter 1825 that action is said to be born of tamas which is undertaken out of delusion and without725 consideration of its consequence loss harm and ability englis h translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1825 tat that karma action yat which is arabhyate undertaken mohat out of delusion nondiscrimination anapeksya without consideration of its anubandham conseque nce the result which accrues later ksayam loss that losss which is incurred in the form of loss of energy or loss of wealth in the course of any action himsam harm suffering to creatures and paurusam ability prowess ones own ability fest as i s hall be able to complete this task without consideration of these from consequence to ability ucyate is said to be tamasam born of tamas 1826 ast introduces this verse with idanim kartrbhedah ucyate now is being stated the distinctions a mong the agents tr the agent who is free from attachment attachment to results or the idea of agentship not egotistic endowed with fortitude and diligence and unperturbed by success and failure is said to be possessed of sattva726 english transla tion of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1826 karta the agent who is mukta sangah free from attachment one by whom attachment has

the fruition and non fruition of any action under taken led only by the authority of the scriptures not by attachment to results etc etc stands for attachment to work the agent who is such he is ucyate said to be sattvikah possessed of sattva 1827 the agent who has attachment who is desirous of the results of actions covetous cruel by nature unclean and subject to joy and sorrow is declared

objects and losing coverted objects and elation and dejection may occur to that very person from his actions being aided or hindered one who is subject to those parikirtitah is declared t o be rajasah possessed of rajas 1828 the agent who is unsteady naive unbending deceitful wicked a variant reading is naikrtikah tr lazy morose and procrastinating is said to be possessed of tamas english

what is to be done today or tomorrow one who is such he ucyate is said to be tamasah possessed of tamas 1829 o dhananjaya listen to the classification of the intellect as also of fortitude which is

bhedam to the classification buddheh of the intellect ca eva as also the classification dhrteh of fortitude trividham which is threefold gunatah according to the gunas sattva etc this much is an

his expedition to conquer all the qaurters he won immense human and divine wealth dhana 1830 o partha that intellect is born of sattva which understands action and withdrawal duty and what is not duty

of sattva ya which vetti understands pravrttim action the path of rites and duties which is the cause of bondage and nivrttim withdrawal the path of renunciation whic h is the cause of liberation since action and withdrawal are mentioned in the same sentence along with bondage and freedom therefore they mean the path of rites and duties and of renunciation karya akarye duty and what is not duty ie what is enjoi ned or prohibited ast adds laukike vaidike va ordinary or vedic injunctions and prohibitions after vihita pratisiddhe and it adds sastrabuddheh before kartavya akartavye730 what

bondage along with its cause and moksam freedom along with its cause in this context knowing is a function of the intellect but the intellect is the possesser of the function fortitude also is only a particular function of the intellect 1831 o partha that intellect is born of rajas with which one wrongly understands virtue and vice as also what ought to be done and ought not to be done english

karyam what ought to be done and akaryam what ought not to be done those very duty and what is not duty as stated earlier 1833 o partha the firmness that is unfailing through concentration with which

despondency eva ca as also madam sensuality enjoyment of objects mentally holding these as things that must always be resorted to considering them to be greatly important to himself like a drunkard thinking of wine the threefold division of action as also of agents according to the differences of the gunas has been stated after that now is being stated the threefold division of results and happiness734 1836 now hear from me o s cion of the bharata dynasty as regards the three kinds of joy that in which one delights owing to habit and certainly attains the cessation of sorrows s and ss take the second line of this verse along with the next verse referring to sattvika happi ness tr english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1836 idanim now srnu hear me from me ie be attentive to what i say tu as regards the trividham three kinds of sukham joy o scion of the bharata dynasty yatra that in which ramate one delights derives pleasure abhyasat owing to habit due to frequent repetition and in the experinece of which joy one nigacchati certainly attains duhkhantam the cessation of sorrow 1837 that which is like poison in the beginning but comparable to nectar in the end and which arises from the pu rity of ones intellect that joy is spoken of as born of sattva735 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1837 yat that joy which is iva like visam poison a source of pain agre in the beginning when it first comes in the early stages of acquisition of knowledge detachment meditation and absorption since they involve great struggle but amrtopamam comparable to nectar pariname in the end when it arises from the maturity of knowledge detachmen t etc and which atma buddhi prasadajam arises from the purity prasada trasparence like water of ones intellect atma buddhi tat that sukham joy is proktam spoken of by the learned ones as sattvikam born of sattva or the phrase atma buddhiprasadajam may mean arising from the high degree of clearness of that atma buddhi knowledge of or connected with the self therefore it is born of sattva 1838 that joy is referred to as born of rajas which arising from the contact of the orga ns and their objects is like nectar in the beginning but like poison at the end736 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1838 tat that sukham joy is smrtam referred to as rajasam born of rajas y at which visaya indriya samyogat arising from the contact of the organs and their objects is amrtopamam like nectar agre in the beginning in the intial moments but iva like visam poison pariname at the end at the end of full enjoyment of th e objects of the senses because it causes loss of strength vigour beauty wisdom prajna the capacity to understand whatever is heard retentive faculty wealth and diligence and because it is the cause of vice and its consequent hell etc 1839 that joy is said to be born of tams which both in the beginning and in the sequel is delusive to oneself and arises from sleep laziness and inadvertence english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1839 tha t joy is udahrtam said to be tamasam born of tamas yat which both agre in the beginning ca and anubandhe in the sequel after737 the end of enjoyment is mohanam delusive atmanah to oneself and nidra alasya pramada uttham arises from sleep laziness and inadvertence therefore now is begun a verse in order to conclude this section the section showing that all things in the whole of creation are under the influence of the three gunas 1840 there is no such entity in the world or again among the gods in heaven which can be free from these three gunas born of nature english

trubhih three gunaih gunas sattva etc prakrti jaih born of nature it has been said that the entire transmigratory state together with its roots characterized by action agent and resuls738 consisting of the gunas sattva rajas and tamas and projected by ignorance is an evil and this also has been said through the imagery of the tree in the verse which has its roots upward etc 151 it has been further said that after felling that tree with the strong sword of detachment thereafter that state has to be sought for 153 4 and as to that since all things consist of the three gunas there arises the impossibility of the eradication of the cause of worldly existence hence it has to be shown how it can be eradicated besides the purport of the scripture gita has to be summed up and it has also to be shown that the import of all the vedas and the smrtis which must be put into prac tice by those who long for the goal of human life is verily this much hence begin the verses the duties of the brahmanas the ksatriyas and the vaisyas etc 1841 o scorcher of enemies the duties of the brahmanas the ksatriyas and the vaisyas as also of the sudras have been fully classified according to the gunas born from nature english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda739 1841 parantapa o scorcher of enemies karmani the duties brahmana ksatr iyavisam of the brahmanas the ksatriyas and the vaisyas ca as also sudranam of the surdras the sudras have not been included with the others in the compund word because owing to their having a single birth sudras have no right to be invested wi th the sacred thread which in the case of the other three castes symbolizes a second birth they have no right to the study of the vedas pravibhaktani have been fully classified have been prescribed by making distinctions among them according to whatgunahi according to the gunas svabhava prabhavaih born from nature nature means the praktrti of god his maya consisting of the three gunas born from nature means born of these three gunas in accordnace with these the duties such as control o f the internal organs etc of the brahmanas and others have been classified or the meaning is the source of the nature of the brahmanas is the quality of sattva similarly the source of the nature of the ksatriyas is rajas with sattva as a subordina te quality the source of the nature of the vaisyas is rajas with tamas as the subordinate quality the source of the nature of the sudras is tamas with rajas as the subordinate quality for the natures of the four are seen to be740 tranquillity lord liness industriousness and dullness respectively or svabhava nature means the individual tendencies of creatures earned in their past lives which have become manifest in the present life for yielding their own results the gunas which have that sva bhava as their source prabhava are svabhava prabhavah gunah since the manifestation of the gunas cannot logically be uncaused therefore a specific cause ie the tendencies are the efficient cause and nature is the material cause has been posited b y saying that nature is the cause thus the duties such as control of the internal organs etc have been classified in keeping with the effects of the gunas sattva rajas and tamas which are born of nature born of prakrti objection well are not the duties like controlling the internal organs etc of the brahmanas and others classified and enjoined by the scriptures why is it said that they are classified according to the gunas sattva etc reply this objection is not valid for the duties like controlling the internal organs etc of the brahmanas and others have been classified even by the scriptures verily in keeping with the specific qualities sattva etc certainly not without reference to the gunas hence though the duties have been divided b y the scriputres they are said741 to have been classified according to the gunas which again are those duties they are being spoken of 1842 the natural duties of the brahmanas are the control of the internal and external organs austerity purity forgiveness straightforwardness knowledge as also wisdom knowledge refers to the understanding of subjects presented by the scriptures wisdom means making them matters of ones own experience and faith english translation of sri sankaracharyas san skrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1842 svabhavajam brahma karma the natural duties of the brhamanas of the brahmana caste are samah control of the internal organs damah control of the external organs these bear the meanings as explained earlie r see 63 104 161 tapah austerity bodily austerity as explained before 1714 saucam purity as already explained in 137 163 ksantih forgiveness arjavam straightforwardness simplicity jnanam knowledge eva ca as also vijnanam wisd om astikyam faith the idea of truth truth of the scritpures existence of god etc in place of asti bhavah ast reads astika bhavah the feeling of conviction with regard to the existence of god and742 the other world tr respect for the teaching of the scriptures by svabhavajam natural is conveyed the very same idea as was expressed in classified according to the gunas born from nature 41 1843 the natural duties of the ksatriyas are heroism boldness fortitude capability and also not ret reating from battle generosity and lordliness english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1843 svabhavajam the natural ksatra karma a variant reading is ksatram karma tr enjoined duties of the ksatriya s of the ksatriya caste are sauryam heroism tejah boldness dhrtih fortitude as is seen in the case of one who is not depressed under all circumstances being sustained by doggedness daksyam capability engagement without confusion in duties which suddenly present them selves api ca and also apalayanam not retreating yuddhe from battle not fleeing from enemies danam generosity being free in the distribution of gifts isvarabhavah lordliness manifesting exercising rulership over those w ho have to be ruled743 1844 the natural duties of the vaisyas are agriculture cattle rearing and trade of the sudras too the natural duty is in the form of service english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhiranand a 1844 svabyavajam the natural vaisya karma duties of the vaisyas of the vaisya caste are krsi gauraksyavanijyam agriculture cattle rearing and trade krsi is tilling of land orre who rears cattle go is goraksa the abstract form of that word is gauraksyam animal husbandry vanijyam means the occupation of a trader consisting of buying and selling sudrasya of the sudra api too svabhavajam the natural karma duty is paricaryatmakam in the form of service when rightly pursued the nat ural result of these duties enjoined for the castes is the attainment of heaven which act is evident from such smrti texts as people belonging to the castes and stages of life who are true to their own duties experience after death the fruit of their a ctions and after that as a result of the remnants of their merits they are born in some excellent region caste and family with greater piety longevity learning conduct wealth744 happiness and intelligence ap dh su 2223 etc and in the puran as also it is particularly mentioned that poeple belonging to the different castes and stages of life come to have specific results in the form of different worlds but this result that is going to be stated follows from a different cause 1845 bein g devoted to his own duty man attains complete success hear that as to how one devoted to his own duty achieves success english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1845 sve sve karmani abhiratah being devoted to his own duty which has different characteristics as stated above narah man the person qualified therefor labhate attains samsiddhim complete success characterized as the ability for steadfastness i n knowledge which follows from the elimination of the impurities of body and mind as a result of fulfilling his own duty does the complete success follow merely from the fulfilment of ones own duty no how then srnu hear tat that yatha as to how through what means sva745 karma niratah one devoted to his own duty vindati acheives siddim success 1846 a human being

duty as dictated by ones own nature one does not incur sin746 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1847 svadharmah ones own duty though vigunah defective the word though has to be supplied is sreyan superior to more praiseworthy than paradharma t anothers duty suanusthitat well performed kurvan by performing karma a duty svabhavaniyatam as dictated by ones own nature this phrase means the same as svabhavajam born from nature which has been stated earlier na apnoti one does not incur kilbisam sin as poison is not harmful to a worm born it it so one does not incur sin by performing a duty dictated by ones own nature it has been siad that as in the case of a worm born in poison a person does not incur sin while performing his duties which have been dictated by his own nature and that someone elses duty is fraught with fear also that one who does not have the knoweldge of the self he surely cannot remain even for a moment without doing work cf 35 hence 1848 o son of kunti one should not give up the duty to which one is born even though it be faulty747 for all undertakings are surrounded with evil as fire is with smoke english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1848 kaunteya o son of kunti na tyajet one should not give up what the karma duty sahajam to which one is born which devolves from the very birth api even though it be sadosam faulty consisting as it is of the three gunas hi for sarva arambh ah all undertakings whatever are begun are arambhah ie all actions according to the context being constituted by the three gunas here the fact of being constituted by the three gunas is the cause are avrtah surrounded dosena with evil iva as agnih fire is dhumena with smoke which comes into being concurrently one does not get freed from evil by giving up the duty to which one is born called ones own duty even though he may be fulfilling somebody elses duty anothers duty too is fraught with fear the meaning is since action cannot be totally given up by an unelightened person therefore he should not relinquish it opponent well is it that one should not abandon action because it cannot be given up completely or748 is it because evil evil resulting from discarding daily obligatory duties follows from the giving up of the duty to which one is born counter objection what follows from this opponent if it be that the duty to which one is born should not be renounced because it is impossible to relinquish it totally then the conclusion that can be arrived at is that complete renunciation of duty is surely meritorious counter objection truly so but may it not be that total relinquishment is itself an impossibilit y is a person ever changeful like the gunas of the sankhyas or is it that action itself is the agent as it is in the case of the momentary five rupa from vedana feeling vijnana momentary consciousness sanjna notion samskara mental impressi ons these have only momentary existence in their case there can be no distinction between action and agent simply due to the fact of their being momentary forms of mundane consciousness propounded by the buddhists in either case there can be no compl ete renunciation of action then there is also a third standpoint as held by the vaisesikas when a thing acts it is active and inactive when that very thing does not act if this be the case here it is possible to entirely give up actions but the speciality of the third point of view is that a thing749 is not ever changing nor is action itself the agent what then a nonexistent action originates in an existing thing and an existing action gets destroyed the thing initself continues to exist along wi th its power to act and that itself is the agent this is what the followers of kanada say their view is that agentship consists in possessing the power to act not in being the substratum of action what is wrong with this point of view vedantin the defect indeed lies in this that this veiw is not in accord with the lords view objection how is this known vedantin since the lord as said of the unreal there is no being etc 216 the view of the followers of kanada is indeed this t hat the non existent becomes existent and the existent becomes nonexistent objection what defect can there be if it be that this view even though not the view of the lord yet conforms to reason vedantin the answer is this is surely faulty since it contradicts all valid evidence objection how vedantin as to this if things like a dvyanuka dyad of two anus atoms be absolutely nonexistent before origination and after origination continue for a little while and again become absolutely non exist ent then in that acase the existent which was verily nonexistent comes into being here ast adds sadeva asattvam750 apadyate that which is verily existent becomes nonexistent tr a non entity becomes an entity and an entity becomes a non entity i f this be the view then the non enity that is to take birth is comparable to the horns of a hare before it is born and it comes into being with the help of what are called material inherent non mateial non inherent and efficient causes but it canno t be said that nonexistence has origination in this way or that it depends on some cause since this is not seen in the case of nonexistent things like horns of a hare etc if such things as pot etc which are being produced be of the nature of potentia lly existing things then it can be accepted that they originate by depending on some cause which merely manifests them according to vedanta before origination a thing eg a pot remains latent in its material cause clay for instance with its name and form unexpressed and it depends on other causes for the manifestation of name and form moreover if the nonexistent becomes existent and the existent becomes non existent then nobody will have any faith while dealing with any of the means of valid knowledge objects of such knowledge because the conviction will be lacking that the existent is existent and the nonexistent is nonexistent further when they speak of751 origination they the viasesikas hold that such a thing as a dvyanuka dyad comes to have relationship with its own material causes the two atoms and existence and that it is nonexistent before origination but later on depending on the operation of its own causes it becomes connected with its own causes viz the atoms as also w ith existence through the inherent or inseparable relationship called samavaya after becoming connected it becomes an existent thing by its inherent relationship with its causes the effect dyad has inherent relationship with existence after its ma terial causes the two atoms come into association it has to be stated in this regard as to how the nonexistent can have an existent as its cuase or have relationship with anything for nobody can establish through any valid means of knowledge that a s on of a barren woman can have any existence or relationship or cause vaisesika is it not that relationship of a non existent thing is not at all established by the vaisesikas indeed what is said by them is that only existent entities like dvyanuka etc have the relationship in the form of samavaya with their own causes vedantin no for it is not admitted by them that anything has existence before the samavaya relationship occurs it is surely not held by the vaisesikas that752 a pot etc have any e xistence before the potter his stick wheel etc start functioning nor do they admit that clay itself takes the shape of a pot etc as a result it has to be admitted by them as the last aternative that nonexistence itself has some relationship vai sesika well it is not contradictory even for a nonexistent thing to have the relationship in the form of inherence vedantin no because this is not seen in the case of a son of a barren woman etc if the antecedent nonexistence prag abhava of the pot etc alone comes into a relationship with its own material cause but not so the nonexistence of the son of a barren woman etc though as nonexistence both are the same then the distinction between the two nonexistences has to be explained through s uch descriptions of abhava nonexistence as nonexistence of one nonexistence of two nonexistence of all antecedent nonexistence nonexistence after destruction mutual nonexistence and absolute nonexistence nobody can show any distinction as regar ds nonexistence itself there being no distinction therefore to say that it is only the antecedent nonexistence of the pot which takes the form of the pot through the action of the potter and others and comes into a relationship with the existi ng pot halves which are its own753 material causes and becomes fit for all empirical processes such as production destruction etc but the nonexistence after destruction of that very pot does not do so though it too is nonexistence hence the non existence after destruction etc etc stands for mutual nonexistence anyonya abhava and absolute nonexistence atyanta abhava are not fit for any empirical processes whereas only the antecedent nonexistence of things called dvyanuka etc is fit for such empirical processes as origination etc all this is incongruous since as nonexistence it is indistinguishable as are absolute nonexistence and nonexistence after destruction vaisesika well it is not at all said by us that the antece dent nonexistence becomes existent vedantin in that case the existent itself becomes existent as for instance a pots becoming a pot or a cloths becoming a cloth this too like nonexistence becoming existent goes against valid evidence even th e theory of transformation held by the sankhyas does not differ from the standpoint of the vaisesikas since they believe in the origination of some new attribute ie in the origination of a transformation that did not exist before and its destruction even if manifestation and disappearance of anything be accepted yet there754 will be contradiction with valid means of knowledge as before in the explanation of existence or nonexistence of manifestation and disappearance hereby is also refuted the idea th at origination etc of an effect are merely particular states of its cuase as thelast alternative it is only the one entity called existence that is imagined variously through ignorance to be possessed of the states of origination destruction etc li ke an actor on a stage this veiw of the lord has been stated in the verse of the unreal there is no being 216 for the idea of existence is constant while the others are inconstant objection if the self be immutable then how does the renu nciation of all actions become illogical vedantin if the adjuncts ie body and organs be real or imagined through ignorance in either case action which is their attribute is surely superimposed on the self through ignorance from this point of vi ew it has been said that an unenlightened person is incapable of totally renouncing actions even for a moment cf 35 the enlightened person on the other hand can indeed totally renounce actions when ignorance has been dispelled through illumination for it is illogical that there can then remain any trace of what has been superimposed through ignorance indeed no trace remains of the755 two moons etc superimposed by the vision affected by the disease called timira when the desease is cured this b eing so the utterance having given up all actions mentally 513 etc as also being devoted to his own duty 45 and a human being achieves success by adoring him through his own duties 46 becomes justifiable what was verily spoken of as the success arising from karma yoga characterized as the fitness for steadfastness in knowledge the fruit of that fitness characterized as steadfastness in knowledge consisting in the perfection in the form of the state of one ie a monk free fro m duties has to be stated hence the following verse is begun 1849 he whose intellect remains unattached to everything who has conquered his internal organs and is desireless attains through monasticism the supreme perfection consisting in the st ate of one free from duties english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1849 asakta buddhih he whose intellect the internal organ remains unattached sarvatra to756 everything with regard to son wife and ot hers who are the cuases of attachment jitatma who has conquered his internal organs and vigata sprhah who is desireless whose thirst for his body life and objects of enjoyment have been eradicated he who is such a knower of the self adhigaccahti attains sannyasena through monasticism through perfect knowledge or through renunciation of all actions preceded by this knowledge the paramam supreme most excellent naiskarmya siddhim perfection consisting in the state of one free from duties one is said to be free from duties from whom duties have daparted as a result of realizing that the actionless brahman is his self his state is naiskarmyam that siddhi perfection which is this naiskarmya is naiskarmya siddhi or this phrase means achieve ment of naiskarmya ie achievement of the state of remaining established in ones own real nature as the actionless self which is different from the success arising from karma yoga and is of the form of being established in the state of immediate l iberation accordingly has it been said having given up all actions mentallywithout doing or causing others to do anything at all 513 the stages through which one who has attained success which has the aforesaid characteristics and which757 arises from the performance of ones own duties mentioned earlier as worship of god and in whom has arisen discriminative knowledge achieves perfection in the form of exclusive adherence to knowledge of the self and consisting in the state of one free fro m duties have to be stated with this is view the lord says 1850 understand for certain from me in brief indeed o son of kunti that process by which one who has achieved success attains brahman which is the supreme consummation of knowledge english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1850 nibodha understand for certain me from me from my utterance is it elaborately the lord says no samasena in brief eva indeed o son of kunti how siddhi m praptah one who has achieved success one who by worshipping god through ones duties has achieved success in the form of fitness of the body and organs for steadfastness in knowledge which comes from his grace the reiteration of the phrase siddhi m praptah is meant for introducing what follows what is that succeeding subject for which this758 reiteration stands is being answered yatha tatha that process by which that process in the form of steadfastness in knowledge by which that process of acqu iring steadfastness in knowledge by which apnoti attains brahma brahman th supreme self in order to point out as it is this the realization of brahman which was promised in that process by which oneattains brahman the lord says ya which is the para supreme nistha consummation ie the supreme culmination jnanasya of knowledge of what of the knowledge of brahman of what kind is it it is of the same kind as the realization of the self of what kind is that as is the self of what nature is it as has been described by the lord and the upanisadic texts and established through reason objection is it not that knowledge takes the form of its object but it is not admitted anywhere that the self is an object or even that it has for m pseudo vedantin is it not heard of in such texts as radiant like the sun sv 38 of the nature of effulgence ch 3142 and selfeffulgent br 439 that the self has form objection no because those sentences are meant for refuting th e idea that the self is of the nature of darkness when the self is denied of possessing forms of substance quality etc the contingency arises of the selfs being of the nature of darkness759 the sentences radiant like the sun etc are meant for rebu ting this and this follows from the specific denial of from by saying formless ka 1315 and from such texts as his form does not exist within the range of vision nobody sees him with the eye ka 239 sv 420 soundless touchless ka 1 315 etc which show that the self is not an object of perception therefore it remains unproved that there can be any knowledge which takes the form of the self how then can there be the knowledge of the self for all knowledge that there can be wi th regard to objects assumes their respective forms and it has been said that the self has no form moreover if both knowledge and the self be formless then how can there be the consummation firmness in self realization of the repeated contemplatio n on that knowledge of the self vedantin no since it can be established that the self is supremely taintless pure and subtle and it can also be established that the intellect can have taintlessness etc like the self therefore it stands to reason t hat the intellect can take a form resembling the consciousness of the self the mind becomes impressed with the semblance of the intellect the organs become impressed with the semblance of the mind and the body becomes impressed with the semblance of hte organs hence760 it is that the idea of the body itself being the self is held by ordinary people the lokayatikas materialists who hold that the body is identical with consciousness say that a person is a body endowed with consciousness so also there a re others who say that the organs are identical with consciousness there are others who say that the mind is identical with consciousness and still others who say that the intellect is identical with consciousness some accept as the self the unmanifest the inmost ruler antaryamin possessing a semblance of consciousness called the undifferentiated which is more internal than that intellect and is within the domain of primordial ignorance indeed in every case beginning from the intellect to the body the cause of mis conceived selfhood is the semblance of the consciousness that is the self hence knowledge about the self is not a subject for injunction what then only the eradication of the superimposition of name form etc which are not the self is what has to be undertaken but not the knowledge of the self that is consciousness for it is the self which is experienced as possessed of the forms of all the various objects that are superimposed on it through ignorance it is evidently because of this that the buddhists who uphold the view of761 momentary consciousness have concluded that there is no substance at all apart from momentary consciousness and that it is not in need of any other valid proof since they hold that it is self cognized therefore what is to be undertaken is only the elimination of the superimposition on brahman through ignorance but no effort is needed for knowing brahman consciousness for it is quite self evident it is because the intellect is distracted b y particular appearances of name and form imagined through ignorance that brahman even though self evident easily realizable nearer than all else and identical with oneself appears to be concealed difficult to realize very far and different but to t hose whose intellect has become free from external appearances and who have obtained the grace of a teacher and serenity of mind there is nothing more blissful manifest well known easily realized and nearer to oneself than this self and thus it has be en declared directly realizable righteous etc 92 however some wiseacres assert that the intellect cannot comprehend the entity called the self since it is formless hence complete steadfastness in knowledge is impossible this is truly so for t hose who have not associated with a traditional line of teachers who have not heard the upanisads762 whose intellects are too much engrossed with external objects and who have not applied themselves diligently to the perfect means of knowledge for those on the other hand who are the opposite of these it is absolutely impossible to have the idea of reality with regard to empirical objects which are within the realm of duality involving the knower and the known because in their case there is no percepti on of any other thing apart from the consciousness that is the self we have already said how this is certainly so and not otherwise it has been stated by the lord also that during which creatures keep awake it is night to the seeing sage 269 ther efore the cessation of the perception of differences in the form of external things is alone the cause of resting in the reality of the self for that which is called the self is never an object which is not well known attainable rejectable or acceptab le to anyone at any time were that self to be indeed not self evident all activities would become meaningless according to ast the latter portion of this sentence is svarthah sarvah pravrttayah vyarthah prasajyeran all activities meant for ones own benefit would become meaningless tr for it cannot be imagined that they could be undertaken for unconscious objects like the body etc besides it763 cannot be that pleasure is for pleasures sake or that sorrow is for sorrows sake moreover all empir ical dealings are meant for culminating in the realization of the self according to bs 3426 on the strength of the upanisadic sanction of sacrifices etc all religious activities as well are necessary sacrifices etc are meant for leading to t he realization of the self without which they would become meaningless therefore just as for knowing ones own body there is no need of any other external means of knowledge so also there is no need of any other means of knowledge for the realizatio n of the self which is innermost in relation to the body etc hence it is established that steadfastness in the knowledge of the self is a fact very well known to the discriminating people even to those who hold that knowledge is formless and not cogni zed by direct perception cognition of an object is dependent on knowledge hence it has to be admitted that knowledge is as immediate as pleasure etc and this follows also from the impossibility of a desire to know knowledge had knowledge been not sel fevident it could have been sought for like any object of knowledge and in that case as this is asts reading others read tatha tr a knower seeks to perceive through knowledge such objects of knowledge as pot etc764 similarly the knower would have sought to perceive knowledge through another knowledge but this is not the case therefore knowledge is quite self revealing and for the very same reason the knower also is self revealed hence effort is not needed for knowledge but only for the remov al of the notion of what is not self in place of anatma buddhi nivrttau ast has anatmani atma buddhi nivrttau for the termination of thinking what is not the self as the self tr consequently steadfastness in knowledge is easy of accomplishment it is being stated how this supreme consummation of knowledge is to be attained 1851 being endowed with a pure intellect and controlling oneself with fortitude rejecting the objects beginning from sound sound touch form and colour taste and sme lltr and eliminating attachment and hatred english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1851 yuktah being endowed buddhya with an intellect which is identical with the faculty of determination visuddha ya pure free from maya765 delusion and niyamya controlling subduing atmanam oneself the aggregate of body and organs dhrtya with fortitude with steadlines tyaktva rejecting visayan the objects sabdadin beginning from sound from the context it follows that rejecting the objects means rejecting all things which are meant for pleasure and are in excess of those meant only for the mere maintenance of the body and vyudasya eliminating raga dvesau attachment and hatred with regard to things which come to hand for the maintenance of the body therefore 1852 one who resorts to solitude eats sparingly has speech body and mind under control to whom meditation and concentration are ever the highest duty and who is possessed of dispass ion english translation of sri

laghuasi eats sparingly is habituated to eating a little repairing to solitary places and eating sparingly are nentioned here since they are the causes of tranquillity of mind through the766 elimination of defects like sleep etc the person steadfast in knowledge yata vakkaya manasah who has speech body and mind under control having all his organs withdrawn thus dhyana yoga parah nityam one to whom meditation and concentration are ever the highest duty meditation is thinking of the real nature of the self and concentration is making the mind one pointed with regard to the self itself one to whom these meditation and concentration are the highest duty is dhyana yoga parah nityam ever is used to indicate the absence of other duties like repetition o f mantra a formula of prayer

says an elated person becomes proud a proud man transgresses righteousness ap dh su 1134 kamam desire krodham anger aversion parigraha m superfluous possessions even after removing the defects in the organs and the mind there arises the possibility of acceptance of gifts either for the maintenance of the body or for righteous duties discarding them as well ie becoming a mendicant of the param hamsa class nirmamah free from the idea of possession becoming devoid of the idea of me and mine even with regard to so much as ones body and life and for the very same reason santah serene withdrawn the monk who is effortless and steadfast in knowledge kalpate becomes fit brahma bhuyaya for becoming brahman 1854 one who has become brahman and has attained the blissful self does not grieve or

brahman attained brahman through the above process and prasanna atma prasada means the manifestation of the supreme bliss of the self as a result of the total cessation of all evils prasanna atma is one who has attained this in the present life itself has attained the blissful self the indwelling self na does not socati grieve does not lament for the loss of something o r the lack of some quality in oneself nor kanksati desire by saying he does not grieve nor desire this nature of one who has attained brahman is being restated for it does not stand to reason that in the case of a knower of brahman there can be any hankering for something unattained or in place of kanksati teh reading may be na hrsyati does not become elated becoming samah the same sarvesu bhutesu towards all being ie he verily judges what is happiness and sorrow in all beings by the same standard as he would apply to himself cf 632 but the meaning is not seeing the self alike in all769 beings for this will be spoken

me to be the knower of the field 132 opponent has it not been contradictory to say he knows me through that which is the supreme steadliness nistha in knowledge vedantin if it be asked how it is contradictory opponent the answer is whenever any knowledge of something arises in a knower at that very moment the knower knows that object hence he does not depend on steadfastness in knowledge which consists i n the repetition of the act of knowing and therefore it is contradictory to say one knows not through knowledge but through steadfastness in knowledge which is a repetition of the act of knowing vedantin there is no such fault since771 the culmination o f knowledge which knowledge is associated with the causes of its unfoldment and maturity and which has nothing to contradict it in the conviction that ones own self has been realized is what is referred to by the word nistha consummation when knowl edge which concerns the identity of the knower of the field and the supreme self and which remains associated with the renunciation of all actions that arise from the perception of the distinction among their accessories such as agent etc and which unfolds from the instruction of the scriptures and teachers depending on purity of the intellect etc and humility etc which are the auxiliary cuases of the origin and maturity of knowledge continues in the form of the conviction that ones own self has been realized then that continuance is called the supreme steadfastness nistha in knowledge this steadfastness in knowledge that is such has been spoken of as the highest the fourth kind of devotion in relation to the three other devotions viz of the af flicted etc cf 716 through that highest devotion one realizes the lord in truth immediately after that the idea of difference between the lord and the knower of the field vanishes totally there fore the statement one knows me through devotion in the form of772 steadfastness in knowledge is not contradictory and in this sense all the scriptures consisting of vedanta upanisads etc history mythology and smrtis as for instance knowing this very self the brahmanas renounceand lead a me ndicants life br 351 therefore they speak of monasticism as excellent among these austerities ma na 241 monasticism verily became supreme ibid 212 which enjoin renunciation become meaningful thus monasticism means renunciation of r ites and duties there are also the texts having renounced the vedas as well as this world and the next ap dh su 2913 and give up religion and irreligion mbh sa 32940 33144 etc and here in the gita also various relevant passages ha ve been pointed out in is not porper that those texts should be meaningless nor are they merely eulogistic since they occur in their own contexts besides liberation consists in being established in the changeless real nature of the indwelling self in deed it is not possible that one who wants to go to the eastern sea and the other who wants to go in the opposite direction to the western sea can have the same course and steadfastness in knowledg consists in being totally absorbed in maintaining a curr ent of thought with regard to the indwelling self and that is opposed773 to coexistence with duties like going to the western sea it has been the conclusion of those versed in the valid means of knowledge that the difference between them is as wide as that between a mountain and a mustard seed therefore it is established that one should have recourse to steadfastness in knowledge only by relinquishing all rites and duties the fruit of the attainment of success from the yoga of devotion consisting in wors hiping the lord with ones own actions is the ability to remain steadfast in knowledge from which follows stead fastness in knowledge culminating in the result liberation that yoga of devotion to the lord is now being praised in this concluding sectio n dealing with the purport of the scripture with a veiw to generating a firm conviction with regard to it the purport of the scripture 1856 ever engaging even in all actions one to whom i am the refuge attains the eternal immutable state throug h my grace english translation of sri

only esyasi you will come mam to me eva alone this satyam truth do i pratijane promise te to you ie in this matter i make this true promise for asi you are priyah dear me to me the idea conveyed by the passage is having thus understood that the lord is true in his pormi se and knowing for certain that liberation is the unfailing result of devotion to the lord one should have dedication to god as his only supreme goal having summed up surrender to god as the highest secret of steadiness in karma yoga there after with the idea that complete realization which is the fruit of adherence to karma yoga and which has been enjoined in all the upanisads has to be spoken about the lord says 1866 abandoning all forms of rites and duties take refuge in me alone i sahll free you from all sins therefore do not grieve782 english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1866 sarva dharman all forms of rites and duties here the word dharma righteousness includes adharma unrighteo usness as well for what is intended is total renunciation of all actions as is enjoined in vedic and smrti texts like one who has not desisted from bad actions ka 1224 give up religions and irreligion mbh sa 32940 etc parityajya aban doning all rites and duties being a ksatriya arjuna is not qualified for steadfastness in knowledge through monasticism in the primary sense still the gita being meant for mankind as a whole monasticism is spoken of here by accepting arjuna as a repr esentative man saranam vraja take refuge mam ekam in me alone the self of all the same in all existing in all beings the lord the imperishable free from being in the womb birth old age and death by knowing that i am verily so that is know it for certain that there is nothing besides me by revealing my real nature aham i moksayisyami shall free tva you who have this certitude of understanding sarva papebhyah from all sins from all bondages in the form of righteousness and unrighteou sness it has also been stated i residing in their hearts destroy783 the dark ness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of knowledge 1011 therefore ma do not sucah grieve ie do not sorrow in this scripture the gita has knowledge been es tablished as the supreme means to liberation or is it action or both why does the doubt arise because the passages like by realizing which one attains immortality 1312 then having known me in truth he enters into me immediately after t hat knowledge 55 etc point to the attainment of liberation through knowledge alone texts like your right is for action alone 247 you undertake action itself 415 etc show that actions have to be under taken as a matter of compulsory d uty since both knowledge and action are thus enjoined as duties therefore the doubt may arise that they in combination as well may become the cause of liberation objection what again would be the result of this inquiry vedantin well the resut wi ll verily be this the ascertainment of one of these as the cuase of the highest good hence this has to be investigated more extensively knowledge of the self however is exclusively the cause of the highest good for through the removal of the idea of differences it culminates in the result that is liberation the idea of distinction among action agent and result is784 ever active with regard to the self because of ignorance this ignorance in the form my work i am the agent i shall do this work for that resut has been at work from time without beginning the dispeller of this ignorance is this knowledge regarding the self in the form i am the absolute non agent free from action and result there is none else other than myself because when it knowledge arises it despels the idea of differences which is the cause of engagement in action the word however above is used for ruling out the other two alternatives this refutes the two other alternative views by showing that the highest good cann ot be attained through mere actions nor by a combination of knowledge and action besides since liberation is not a product therefore it is illogical that it should have action as its means indeed an eternal entity cannot be produced by either action of knowledge objection in that case ever exclusive knowledge is purposeless vedantin no since knowledge being the destroyer of ignorance culminates in liberation which is directly experienced result the fact that knowledge which removes the darkn ess of ignorance culminates in liberation as its result is directly perceived in the same way as is the result of the light of a lamp which removes ignorance the785 form of sanke etc and darkness from objects such as rope etc indeed the result of light am ounts to the mere awareness of the rope free from the wrong notions of snake etc so is the case with knowledge as in the case of the acts like cutting down producing fire by friction etc in which accessories such as the agent and others operate and which have perceivable results there is no possiblity of the agent etc engaging in any other activity giving some other result apart from splitting into two seeing or lighting of fire etc similarly in the case of the agent and the other factors engaged in the act of steadfastness in knowledge which has a tangible result there is no possibility of their engagement in any other action which has a result different from that in the form of the sole existence of the self hence steadfast ness in knowledge combined with action is not logical objection may it not be argued that this is possible like the acts of eating and agnihotra sacrifice etc as such a common action as eating can go hand in hand with such vedic rites as the agnihotra sacrifice so actions can be combined with knowledge vedantin no since it is unreasonable that when knowledge which resutls in liberation is attained there can remain a hankering for results of actions just as there is no786 desire for an action or i ts result action ie digging etc result ie bathing etc in connection with a well pond etc when there is a flood all around similarly when knowledge which has liberation for its result is attained there can be no possibility of hankering for a ny other result or any action which leads to it indeed when somebody is engaged in actions aimed at winning a kingdom there can be no possibility of his engaging in any activity for securing a piece of land or having a longing for it hence action doe s not constitute the means to the highest good nor do knowledge and action in combination further knowledge which has liberation as its result can have no dependence on the assistance of action because being the remover of ignorance it is opposed to action verily darkness cannot be the dispeller of darkness therefore knowledge alone is the means to the highest good objection not so because from non performance of nityakarmas one incurs sin besides freedom of the self is eternal as for the view that liberation is attainable through knowledge alone it is wrong for if nityakarmas as also the occasional duties naimittika karmas which are prescribed by the vedas are not performed then one will incur evil in the form of going to hell et c counter objection if this be so787 then since liberation cannot come from action will there not arise the contingency of there being no liberation at all pseudo vedantin not so for liberation is eternal as a result of performing nityakarmas there w ill not be incurring of evil and as a result of not doing any prohibited action nisiddha karma there will not be any possibility of birth in an undesirable body from relinquishing actions meant for desired results kamya karmas there will be no possib ility of being born in some desirable body since there is no cause to produce another body when the present body falls after the results of actions that produced this body get exhausted by experiencing them and since one does not have attachment etc th erefore liberation consists in the mere continuance of the self in its own natural state thus liberation is attained without effort objection may it not be argued that since in the case of actions done in many past lives which are calculated to yield such results as attainment of heaven hell etc but have not commenced bearing results there is no possiblity of their being experienced therefore they cannot be exhausted pseudo vedantin no since the suffering of pain from the effort involved in the nityakarmas can reasonably be considered to be the experiencing of their ie of actions done in788 past lives which have not commenced bearing their fruits tr results or since the nityakarmas like expiations may be considered as being meant for el iminating the sins incurred earlier and since actions that have begun bearing their fruits get exhausted merely through their being experienced therefore liberation is attained without effort provided no fresh actions are performed vedantin no since t here is the upanisadic text knowing him alone one goes beyond death there is no other way to go by sv 38 which states that for liberation there is no other path but enlightenment also because there is the upanisadic statement that liberation for an unenlightened person is as impossible as the rolling up of the sky like leather sv 620 and since it is mentioned in the puranas and the smrtis that liberation follows only from knowledge from your view it also follows that there is no possibili ty of the exhaustion of the results of virtuous deeds which have not as yet begun yielding their fruits and as there is the possibility of the persistence of sins which were incurred in the past but have not yet commenced yielding results similarly ther e can be the possibility of the persistence of virtues which have not yet begun bearing fruits and so if there be no scope of their789 being exhausted without creating another body then there is no possibility of liberation and since attachment hatred an d delusion which are the causes of virtue and vice cannot be eradicated through any means other than knowledge therefore the eradication of virtue and vice becomes impossible besides since the sruti see ch 2231 and br 1516 tr mentions that nityakarmas have heaven as their result and there is the smrti text persons belonging to castes and stages of life and engaged in their own duties attain to a high immeasurable happiness tr ap dh su 2223 etc therefore the exhaustio n of the fruits of actions through nityakarmas is not possible as for those who say the nityakarmas being painful in themselves must surely be the result of evil deeds done in the past but apart from being what they are they have no other result because this is not mentioned in the vedas and they are enjoined on the basis of the mere fact that one is alive this is not so because actions which have not become operative cannot yield any result besides there is no ground for experiencing a par ticular consequence in the form of pain pain involved in the performance of nityakarmas the statement that the pain one suffers from the effort involved in performing the790 nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in past lives is false indeed it does not stand to reason that the result of any action which did not become operative at the time of death to yield its fruit is experienced in a life produced by some other actions otherwise there will be no reason why the fruit of some action that is to lead to hell should not be experienced in a life that is produced by such actions as agnihotra etc and is meant for enjoying the result in the form of heaven besides that pain arising from the effort in performing nityakarmas cannot be the same as the consequence in the form of the particular suffering arising from sin since there can be numerous kinds of sins with results productive of various kinds of sorrows therefore if it be imagined that their sins result will be merely in the form of pa in arising from the effort in undertaking the nityakarmas then it will certainly not be possible to suppose that they the sins incurred in the past are the causes of such obstacles as the pairs of opposites heat and cold etc disease etc and that the result of sins incurred in the past will be only the pain arising from the exertion in performing nityakarmas but not the sufferings like carrying stones on the head etc further it is out of context to say this that the pain resulting from the effo rt in791 performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in the past objection how vedantin what is under discussion is that the sin committed in the past which has not begun to bear fruit cannot be dissipated in that context you say that pain resulting from the effort in undertaking nityakarmas is the result of action which has begun bearing fruit not of that which has not yet commenced yielding fruit on the other hand if you think that all sins committed in the past have begun yielding the ir results then it is unreasonable to specify that the pain resulting from the exertion in performing the nitya karmas is their only result and there arises the contingency of the injunction to perform nityakarmas becoming void because the sinful deed w hich has begun bearing fruit can ligically be dissipated only be experiencing its result further if pain be the result of nityakarmas enjoined by the vedas then it is seen to arise from the very effort in undertaking nityakarmas as in the case of excerc ise etc to imagine that it is the result of something else is illogical the pain arising from bodily excercise is the result of the excercise itself and not the result of any past sin similarly the pain resulting from undertaking nityakarmas is the c onsequence of that performance itself and need not be imagined to be792 the result of any past sin and if the nityakarmas have been enjoined simply on the basis of a persons being alive it is unreasonable that it should be the result of sins committed in the past any more than expiation is an expiation that has been enjoined following a particular sinful act is not the result of that sin on the other hand if the suffering arising from expiation be the reslut of that very sin which is its cause then t he pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas though prescribed merely on the fact of ones being alive may become the fruit of that very fact of ones being alive which was itself the occasion for enjoining the nityakarmas because both the nitya karmas and expiatory duties are indistinguishable so far as their being occasioned by something is concerned moreover there is the other fact there can be no such distinction that only the pain resulting from the performance of nityakarmas is the result of past sinful deeds but not so the pain from performing kamya karmas rites and duties undertaken for desired results because the pain in performing agnihotra sacrifice etc is the same when it is performed as a nityakarma or as a kamya karma thus th e latter also may be the result of past sinful acts this being the case it is untenable to assume on the ground of793 circumstantial inference that since no result is enjoined in the vedas for nityakarmas and since its prescription cannot be justified on a ny other ground therefore pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful past deeds thus the vedic injunction being unjustifiable otherwise it can be inferred that nityakarmas have got some result other than the pain arising f rom the effort in undertaking them it also involves this contradiction it is contradictory to say that through the performance of nityakarma a result of some other action is experienced and when this is admitted it is again a contradiction to say that that very experience is the result of the nityakarma and yet that niyakarma has no result moreover when agnihotra and other sacrifices are performed for desirable results kamya agnihotra then the agnihotra etc which are performed as nityakarma nity aagnihotra become accomplished simultaneously on a account of its being a part ofthe former hence since the kamya agnihotra as an act is dependent on and not different from the nitya agnihotra therefore the result of the agnihotra and other sacrif ices performed with a desire for results will get exhausted through the suffering involved in the exertion in undertaking it the794 nitya agnihotra on the other hand if the result of kamya agnihotra etc be different viz heaven etc then even the suffer ing arising from the exertion in performing them ought to be necessarily different from the suffering involved in the nitya agnihotra and that is not the fact because it contradicts what is directly perceived for the pain resulting from the effort in performing only the nitya agnihotra does not differ from the pain resulting from the exertion in undertaking the kamya agnihotra besides there is this other consideration actions which have not been enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures produ ce immediate results but those enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures do not produce immediate results were they to do so then there would be no effort even with regard to heaven etc and injunctions concerning unseen results and it cannot be imagine d that only the fruit of nitya agnihotra etc gets exhausted through the suffering arising from the effort in performing them but the kamya agnihotra has exalted results like heaven etc merely as a consequence of the fact of desire for results tho ugh as acts there is no essential difference between them the nitya and the kamya and there is no additional subsidiary part processes of performance etc in795 the kamya agnihotra therefore it can never be established that nitya karmas have no unseen results and hence enlightenment alone not the performance of nityakarmas is the cuase of the total dissipation of actions done through ignorance be they good or bad for all actions have for their origin ignorance and desire thus has it been establ ished in the following passages that action rites and duties is meant for the ignorant and steadfastness in knowledge after renunciation of all actions is meant for the enlightened both of them do not know 219 he who knows this one as indestru ctible eternal 221 through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization through the yoga of action for the yogis 33 the ignorant who are attached to work 326 butthe one who is a knowerdoes not become attached thinking thus the organs rest on the objects of the organs 328 the embodied manhaving given up all actions mentally continues 513 remaining absorbed in the self the knower of reality should think i certainly do not do anything 58 ie the unen lightened person thinks i do for the sage who wishes to ascend to dhyana yoga action is said to be the meanswhen he has ascended when he is established in the yoga of meditation796 inaction alone is said to be the means 63 noble indeed are all the three classes of unenlightened persons but the man of knowledge is the very self this is my opinion 718 the unenlightened who perform their rites and duties who are desirous of pleasures attain the state of going and returning 921 becoming non different from me and meditative 922 and endowed with steadfast devotion they worship me the self which has been described as comparable to space and taintless and i grant that possession of wisdom by which they reach me 10 10 ie the unenlightened persons who perform rites and duties do not reach me those who perform works for the lord and who though they be the most devout are ignorant persons performing rites and duties they remain involved in practices which in a descending order culminate in giving up the fruit of actions cf 126 11 but those who meditate on the indefinable immutable take recourse to the disciplines stated in the passages beginning with he who is not hateful towards any creature 1213 and ending with that chapter and also resort to the path of knowledge presented in the three chapters beginning with the chapter on the field the three results of actions viz the undesirable etc cf 12 do not accrue only to the797 mendicants belongin g to the order of paramahamsas the highest order of monks who have renounced all actions that originate from the five causes beginning with the locus cf 14 who possess the knowledge of the oneness and non agentship of the self 1720 who continue i n the supreme steadfastness in knowledge who know the real nature of the lord and who have taken refuge in the unity of the real nature of the lord with the self it does accrue to the others who are not monks the ignorant persons who perform rites and duties such is this distinction made in the scripture gita with regard to what is duty and what is not objection may it not be argued that it cannot be proved that all actions are due to ignorance reply no it can be proved as in the case of slayin g a brahmin although the nityakarmas are known from the scriptures still they are meant only for the ignorant as such an action as killing a brahmin even though known to be a source of evil from the scripture prohibiting it is still perpetrated by one who has defects such as ignorance passion etc because impulsion to any action is otherwise not possible so also is it with regard to the nitya naimittika and kamya actions objection may it not be held that impulsion to nityakarma etc is not possi ble if the self be not798 known as a distinct entity unless one knows the self to be distinct from the body etc he will not perform the nityakarmas etc meant for results in the other worlds viz heaven etc tr in place of vyatiriktatmani ast reads deha vyatiriktatmani the self which is distinct from the body reply no since it is seen that with regard to actions which are of the nature of motion and are accomplished by the not self one engages in them with the idea i do the actionless sel f is not the agent of the movements of the body etc still agentship is superimposed on it through ignorance objection can it not be said that the notion of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc occurs in a figurative sense it is not false reply no since its effects ie the effects of the notion of egoism also will become figurative objection the notion of i with regard to the aggregate of ones own body etc occurs in a figurative sense as with regard to ones own son it is said in the veda it is you yourself who is called the son sa br 149426 and in common parlance also it is said this cow is my very life so is the case here as the use of the word i with regard to a son is figurative so also with regard to the body this is certainly not a false notion however a false notion of identity occurs in the799 case of a stump and a man when the distinction between them is not evident due to darkness reply a figuratively expressed notion cannot lead to an effe ct in the real sense because that notion is used for the eulogy of its basis with the help of a word of comparison which remains understood as for instance such sentences as devadatta is a lion the boy is a fire implying like a lion like a fire on the basis of the similarity of cruelty the tawny colour etc are meant only for eulogizing devadatta and the boy who are the basis ie the subjects of the two sentences but no action of a lion or a fire is accomplished because of the use of the figurative words or ideas on the contrary one experiences the evil effects of false notions therefore the idea of i with regard to ones body etc does not occur in a secondary sense but it does so falsely and with regard to the subjects of th e figurative notions one understands this devadatta cannot be a lion this boy cannot be a fire similarly actions done by the aggregate of body etc which is the self in a figurative sense cannot be held to have been done by the self which is the real subject of the notion of i for actions done by the figurative lion or fire cannot be considered to have been accomplished by the real lion or fire nor is any action of the real lion and800 fire accomplished through the figurative cruelty or tawny aness for their purpose is fully served by being used for eulogy and those who are praised know i am not a lion i am not fire and neither is the work of a lion or fire mine so the more ligical notion is the action of the aggregate of body etc do not belong to me who am the real self and not i am the agent it is my work as for the assertion made by some that the self acts through its own memory deisre and effort which are the causes of activity that is not so for they are based on fal se knowledge memory desire effort etc indeed follow from the tendencies born from the experience of the desirable and the undesirable results of actions which actions themselves arise from the notions of the desirable and the undesirable caused by false knowledge false knowledge gives rise to the ideas of the desirable and the undesirable from these arise desire and repulsion actions which follow give rise to the experience of their desirable and undesirable results such experiences create impressions in the mind from which are born memory etc just as in this life virtue vice and the experience of their results are cuased by the identification of the self with the aggregate of body etc and attraction repulsion etc so also was it i n the previous birth801 and even in the life preceding that thus it can be inferred that past and future mundane existence is without beginning and is a product of ignorance and from this it becomes proved that the absolute cessation of mundane existence i s caused by steadfastness in knowledge accompanied by renunciation of all rites and duties besides since selfidentification with the body is nothing but ignorance therefore when the ignorance ceases there remains so possibility of re birth and so mundane existence becomes impossible the identification of the self with the aggregate of body etc is nothing but ignorance because in common life it is not seen that anybody who knows i am different from cattle etc and the cattle etc are differe nt from me entertains the notion of i with regard to them however mistaken perceiving a stump to be a man one may out of indiscrimination entertain the idea of i with regard to the aggregate of body etc not so when perceiving them as distinct a s for that notion of considering the son to be oneself as mentioned in it is you yourself who is called the son sa br 149426 that is a metaphor based on the relationship between the begotten and the begetter and no real action like eating etc can be accomplished through something considered802 metaphorically as the self just as actions of the real lion or fire cannot be accomplished by someone metaphorically thought of to be a lion or fire objection since an injunction relating to an unseen result is valid therefore may it not be said that the purposes of the self are accomplished by the body and organs which are figuratively considered to be the self reply no since the thinking of them as the self is the result of ignorance the body organs etc are not the self in a figurative sense objection how then reply although the self is devoid of relationship still by an ascription of relationship to the self they body etc come to be regarded as the self verily through a false notion for this identification of body etc with the self exists so long as the false notion is there and ceases to exist when it is not there so long as ignorance lasts identification of the self with the aggregate of body and organs is seen only in th e case of non discriminating immature ignorant poeple who say i am tall i am fair but in the case of discriminating persons who possess the knowledge i am different from the aggregate of body etc there does not arise the idea of egoism with r egard to the body etc at that time ie simultaneously with that knowledge hence since it ie identification of the self with the body etc803 ceases in the absence of the false notion therefore it is a creation of that false notion and not a figurative notion it is only when the common and the uncommon features of the lion and devadatta or of fire and the boy are known distinctly that a figurative notion or verbal expression can occur not when the common and the uncommon features are unknown as for the argument that the figurative notion should be accepted on the authority of the vedas we say no because their validity concerns unseen results the validity of the vedas holds good only with regard to matters concerning the relation betwe en ends and means of agnihotra etc which are not known through such valid means of knowledge as direct perception but not with regard to objects of direct perception etc because the validity of the vedas lies in revealing what is beyond direct percept ion therefore it is not possible to imagine that the idea of egism with regard to the aggregate of body etc arising from an obviously of false knowledge is a figurative notion surely even a hundred vedic texts cannot become valid if they assert that fire is cold or non luminous should a vedic text say that fire is cold or non luminous even then one has to assume that the intended meaning of the text is different for otherwise its validity cannot be maintained but804 one should not assume its meanin g in a way that might contradict some other valid means of knowledge or contradict its own statement objection may it not be said that since actions are undertaken by one possessed of a false idea of agentship therefore when the agent ceases to be so according to you the vedantin an ignorant man alone can be an agent therefore when he becomes illumined he will cease to be ignorant and consequently the vedas will cease to be valid for him the vedas will become invalid reply no since the ved as become logically meaningful in respect of knowledge of brahman though the vedic injunctions about rituals etc be inapplicable in the case of an enlightened person still they have empirical validity before enlightenment besides the vedas have real validity with regard to the knowledge of brahman objection may it not be said that there arises the contingency of the vedic texts enjoining knowledge of brahman becoming as invalid as those texts enjoining rites and duties reply no since there canno t possibly be any notion which can remove the knowledge of brahman unlike the manner in which the idea of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc is removed after the realization of the self from hearing the vedic injunctions regarding the805 know ledge of brahman the realization of the self in the self can never be removed in any way in that manner by anything whatsoever just as the knowledge that fire is hot and luminous is irremovable since self realization is inseparable from its result i e cessation of ignorance besides the vedic texts enjoining rites and duties etc are not invalid because they through the generation of successively newer tendencies by eliminating the successively preceding tendencies are meant for creating the tendency to turn towards the indwelling self the vedic injunctions make people up rituals etc by giving up their earlier worldly tendencies thereby their minds become purified the purified mind then aspires to know the indwelling self thus since the ritualistic injunctions are meant for making a person turn towards the knowledge ofthe indwelling self they are not invalid although the means be unreal in itself still it may be meaningful in relation to the truth of the purpose it serves as are t he eulogistic sentences arthavada see note on p 40 tr occuring along with injunctions even in the world when it becomes necessary to make to child or a lunatic drink milk etc it is said that it will help growth of hair cuda lit hair on the top of the head or single lock of hair left on the crown of the806 head after tonsure see vsa etc before the dawn of knowledge the ritualistic vedic texts concerned with a different situation the situation obtaining before the dawn of self knowledge are also as valid in themselves as are direct perception etc occuring due to self identification with the body etc on the other hand as for your view the self though inactive by itself acts through its mere proximity and that itself constitutes ag entship of the self in the primary sense just as it is well known that a king though not himself engaged in a battle is merely by virtue of his being in charge said to be fighting when his soldiers are fighting and that he is victorious or defeated similarly as the commander of an army acts through his mere orders and it is seen that the results of the actions accrue to the king or to the commander or just as the actions of the priests are ascribed to the sacrificer in that very manner are the a ctions done by the body etc ought to be of the self because the result of those actions accrues to the self and as the agentship of a magnet which in fact is not active is attributed to it in the primary sense because it causes a piece of iron to mov e similar is the agentship of the self that is wrong since it will amunt to an inactive entity becoming an agent objection may not agentship be of various kinds807 reply no for in the case of the king and others it is seen that they have agentship e ven in the primary sense as for the king he fights even through his personal engagement and he has agentship in the primary sense by virtue of making his warriors fight distributing wealth and also reaping the fruits of victory or defeat similarly the agentship of a sacrificer is primary by virtue of his offering the main oblation and giving gifts due to the priests therefore it is understood that the agentship which is attributed to an inactive entity is figurative if primary agentship consistin g in their personal engagement is not perceived in the case of the king a sacrificer and others then it could be assumed that they have primary agentship owing to the mere fact of their presence just as a magnet has by virtue of making the iron move bu t in the case of the king and others it is not perceived that they have no personal engagement in that way therefore even the agentship owing to mere presence is a figurative one and if that be so the connection with the result of such agentship will a lso be figurative no action in the primary sense is performed by an agent figuratively thought to be so hence the assertion is certainly wrong that owing to the activities of the body etc the actionless self808 becomes an agent and experiencer but everyth ing becomes possible due to error this is just as it happens in dream or in jugglery besides in deep sleep absorption in brahman etc where the current of the mistaken idea of self identity with the body etc ceases evils like agentship enjoyership etc are not perceived therefore this delusion of mundane existence is surely due to false knowledge but it is not reality consequently it is established that it ceases absolutely as a result of full enlightenment having summed up in this chapter the import of the whole of the scripture gita and having again summarized it specially here at the end in verse 66 for the sake of emphasizing the purport of the scripture now after that the lord states the rules for handing down the scripture 1867 th is that i have taught you should not ever be taught to one who is devoid of austerities and to one who is not a devotee also neither to one who does not render service nor as well to one who cavils at me english translation of sri sankaracharyas s anskrit commentary swami gambhirananda809 1867 idam this scripture which has been taught by me te to you for your good for terminating mundane existence an vacyam should not be taught na is connected with the remote word vacyam atapaskaya to one who is devoid of austerities it should kadacana never under any condition whatsoever be taught abhaktaya to one who is not a devotee who is devoid of devotion to his teacher and god even if he be a man of austerity neither should it be taught even asurusave to one who does not redner service even though he may be a devotee and a man of austerity na ca nor as well to him yah who abhyasuyati cavils mam at me at vasudeva thinking that i am an ordinary person to him who not knowing my g odhood imputes self adulation etc to me and cannot tolerate me he too is unfit to him also it should not be imparted from the force of the context it is understood that the scripture should be taught to one who has devotion to the lord is austere re nders service and does not cavil as to that since it is seen in a smrti to one who is intelligent or to one who is austere that there is an option between the two it follows that this should be imparted either to an austere person given to service and devotion or to an intelligent person endowed with them it should810 not be imparted to an austere or even an intelligent person if he lacks service and devotion it should not be taught to one who cavils at the lord even though he be possessed of all t he good qualities and it should be taught to one whoserves his teacher and is devout this is the rule for transmitting the scripture now the lord states the fruit derived by one who transmits the scripture 1868 he who entertaining supreme devotio n to me will speak of this highest secret to my devotees will without doubt reach me alone english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1868 yah he who abhi dhasyati will speak of ie will present with the help of the text and its meaning as i have done to you imam this paramam highest that which has liberation as its purpose guhyam secret as spoken of above ie the text in the form of a conversation between kesava and arjuna madbhaktesu to my devotees how will present this is being stated krtva entertaining param supreme bhaktim devotion mayi to me ie entertainting an idea thus a service is being rendere d by me to the lord who is811 the supreme teacher tho him comes this result esyati he will reach mam me eva alone he is certainly freed no doubt should be entertained in this regard by the repetition of the word bhakti devotion in the word ma dbhaktesu it is understood that one becomes fit for being taught this scripture by virtue of devotion alone to him besides 1869 and as compared with him none else among human beings is the best accomplisher of what is dear to me moreover nor will there be anyone else in the world dearer to me than he english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1869 ca and tasmat as compared with him with the one who hands down the scripture na kascit none else manusyesu among human beings is priya krttamah the best accomplisher of what is dear me to me ie among the present human beings surely none else other than him exists who is a better accomplisher of what i cherish moreover na bhavita no r will there be in future anyah anyone else a second person bhuvi in he812 world here priyatarah dearer tasmat than him it may be argued that since for a seeker of liberation meditation is the best means for it therefore he will have no inclinat ion to transmit scriptural teachings to this the lords answer is one longing for liberation has a duty to impart this scriptural teaching to one possessing the aforesaid qualities 1870 and he who will study this sacred conversation between us two which is conducive to virtue by him i shall be adored through the sacrifice in the form of knowledge this is my judgement english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1870 ca and even he yah who adhyesy ate will study imam this samvadam conversation the text in the form of a dialogue between avayoh us two which is dharmyam conducive to virtue not divorced from virtue tena by him this will be accomplished through that study aham i syam shall be istah adored jnana yajnena through the sacrifice in the form of knowledge iti this is me my matih judgement as compared with the813 various sacrifices viz rituals loud prayer prayer uttered in a low voice and mental prayer the sacrifice i n the from of knowledge is the best see 433 because it is mental hence the study of the scripture gita is praised as that sacrifice in the form of knowledge or this verse may merely be a judgement about the result the idea is that the result of the study is comparable to the result of the sacrifice in the form of the knowledge of gods and others now this is the reward for the hearer 1871 any man who being reverential and free from cavilling might even hear this he too becoming free shall attain the blessed worlds of those who perform virtuous deeds english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1871 yah narah any man who being sraddhavan reverential and anasuyah free from cavilling srnuyat api might even hear this text the word even suggests that one who knows the meaning of the scripture hardly needs to be mentioned sah api he too becoming muktah free from sin prapnuyat shall attain subhan the blessed auspicious lokan w orlds punya karmanam of814 those who perform virtuous deeds of those who perform rites like agnihotra etc in order to ascertaini whether or not the disciple has comprehended the meaning of the scripture the lord asks the following question the intenti on of the questioner beings if it is known that it has not been comprehended i shall again make him grasp it through other means hereby is shown the duty of the teacher that a student should be made to achieve his goal by taking the help of a differen t method 1872 o partha has this been listened to by you with a one pointed mind o dhananjaya has your delusion caused by ignorance been destroyed english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1872 o partha kaccit etat has this that has been said by me been srutam listened to grasped through hearing ekagrena with a none pointed cetasa mind or have you been inattentive o dhananjaya kaccit has te your ajnana sammohah delusion cau sed by ignorance815 bewilderment natural indiscrimination been pranastah destroyed for which purpose has there been this effort on your part for hearing the scripture and on my part the effort of being a teacher 1873 arjuna said o acyuta my delusion has been destroyed and memory has been regained by me through your grace i stand with my doubt removed i shall follow your instruction english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1873 o acyuta my mohah born of ignorance and the cause of all evil in the form of mundane existence and difficult to cross like an oceanl nastah has been destroyed and smrtih memory regarding the reality of the self on the acquisition of which follows the loosening of all the bonds labdha has been regained tvat prasadat through your grace maya by me who am dependent on your grace by this question about the destruction of delusion and the answer to it it becomes conclusively revealed that the fruit derived fro m understanding the import of the entire scripture is this much alone which is the destruction of816 delusion arising from ignorance and the regaining of the memory about the self and similarly in the upanisadic text beginning with i grieve because i am no t a knower of the self ch 713 it is shown that all bonds become destroyed when the self is realized there are also the words of the upanisadic verses the knot of the heart gets untied mu 228 at that time or to that self what delusion an d what sorrow can there be for that seer of oneness is7 now then sthitah asmi i stand under your command gata sandehah with my doubts removed karisye i shall follow tava your vacanam instruction by your grace i have achieved the goal of life the idea is there is no duty as such for me the teaching of the scripture is concluded there after now in order to show the connection of this with the main narrative 1874 sanjaya said i thus heard this conversation of vasudeva and of the great souled partha which is unique and makes ones hair stand on end english translation of sri sankaracharyas sanskrit commentary swami gambhirananda 1874 aham i iti thus asrausam heard imam this samvadam conversation as has b een817 narrated vasudevasya of vasudeva and mahatmanah parthasya of the great soulded partha which is adbhutam unique extremely

heard etat the commentator uses etam in the masculine gender in place of etat in the text because it refers to the masculine word samvada should rather be etam this guhyam secret dialogue such as it is concerning the param supreme yogam yoga or this dialogue itself is the yoga because it is meant for it krsnat from krsna yogeswarat from the lord of yogas kathayatah while he was speaking svayam himself saksat actually not indirectly thro ugh others818 1876 and o king while repeatedly remembering this unique sacred dialogue between kesava and arjuna i rejoice every moment english translation
