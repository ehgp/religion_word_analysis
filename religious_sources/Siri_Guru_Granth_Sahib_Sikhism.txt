alone is perfect in this world in whose heart there is none other than the lord331 whose son is he whose father is he who dies who inflicts pain the lo rd is the thug who has drugged and robbed the whole world i am separated from the lord how can i survive o my mother whose husband is he whose wife is she contemplate this reality within your body says kabeer my mi nd is pleased and satisfied with the thug the effects of the drug have vanished since i recognized the thug now the lord my king has become my help and support i have cut away birth and death and attained the supreme status pause he has united me with the saadh sangat the company of the holy he has rescued me from the five demons i chant with my tongue and meditate on the ambrosial naam the name of the lord he has made me his own slave the true guru has blessed me with his generosity he has lifted me up out of the world ocean i have fallen in love with his lotus feet the lord of the universe dwells continually within my consciousness the burning fire of maya has been extinguished my mind is contented with the support of the naam god the lord and master is totally permeating the water and the land wherever i look there is the inner knower the searcher of hearts he himself has implanted his devotional worship within me by pre ordained destiny one meets him o my siblings of destiny when he grants his grace one is perfectly fulfilled kabeers lord and master is the cherisher of the poor there is pollution in the water and pollution on the land wh atever is born is polluted there is pollution in birth and more pollution in death all beings are ruined by pollution tell me o pandit o religious scholar who is clean and pure meditate on such spiritual wisdom o my friend pa use there is pollution in the eyes and pollution in speech there is pollution in the ears as well standing up and sitting down one is polluted ones kitchen is polluted as well everyone knows how to be caught but hardly anyone knows how to escape says kabeer those who meditate on the lord within their hearts are not polluted 3 gauree resolve this one conflict for me o lord if you require any work from your humble servant is this mind great er or the one to whom the mind is attuned is the lord greater or one who knows the lord is brahma greater or the one who created him are the vedas greater or the one from which they came says kabeer i have become depressed i s the sacred shrine of pilgrimage greater or the slave of the lord raag gauree chaytee behold o siblings of destiny the storm of spiritual wisdom has come it has totally blown away the thatched huts of doubt and torn apart the bond s of maya pause the two pillars of double mindedness have fallen and the beams of emotional attachment have come crashing down the thatched roof of greed has caved in and the pitcher of evil mindedness has been broken332 1 your servant is drenched with the rain that has fallen in this storm says kabeer my mind became enlightened when i saw the sun rise gauree chaytee one universal creator god by the grace of the true guru they do not listen to the lords praises and they do not sing the lords glories but they try to bring down the sky with their talk what can anyone say to such people you should always be careful around those whom god has excluded from his devotional worship they do not offer even a handful of water while they slander the one who brought forth the ganges sitting down or standing up their ways are crooked and evil they ruin themselves and then they ruin others they kno w nothing except evil talk they would not even obey brahmas orders they themselves are lost and they mislead others as well they set their own temple on fire and then they fall asleep within it they laugh at others while they themselves are one eyed seeing them kabeer is embarrassed 6 raag gauree bairaagan kabeer jee one universal creator god by the grace of the true guru he does not honor his ancestors while they are alive but he holds feas ts in their honor after they have died tell me how can his poor ancestors receive what the crows and the dogs have eaten up if only someone would tell me what real happiness is speaking of happiness and joy the world is perishing how can h appiness be found 1 making gods and goddesses out of clay people sacrifice living beings to them such are your dead ancestors who cannot ask for what they want you murder living beings and worship lifeless things at you r very last moment you shall suffer in terrible pain you do not know the value of the lords name you shall drown in the terrifying world ocean you worship gods and goddesses but you do not know the supreme lord god says kabeer you have n ot remembered the lord who has no ancestors you are clinging to your corrupt ways gauree one who remains dead while yet alive will live even after death thus he merges into the primal void of the absolute lord remaining pure in the midst of impurity he will never again fall into the terrifying world ocean o my lord this is the milk to be churned through the gurus teachings hold your mind steady and stable and in this way drink in the ambrosial nectar the gurus arrow has pierced the hard core of this dark age of kali yuga and the state of enlightenment has dawned in the darkness of maya i mistook the rope for the snake but that is over and now i dwell in the eternal home of the lord333 maya has drawn her bow without an arrow and has pierced this world o siblings of destiny the drowning person is blown around in the ten directions by the wind but i hold tight to the string of the lords love the disturbed min d has been absorbed in the lord duality and evil mindedness have run away says kabeer i have seen the one lord the fearless one i am attuned to the name of the lord 2 gauree bairaagan ti padas i turned my breath inwards and p ierced through the six chakras of the body and my awareness was centered on the primal void of the absolute lord search for the one who does not come or go who does not die and is not born o renunciate my mind has turned away from the world and is absorbed in the mind of god by gurus grace my understanding has been changed otherwise i was totally ignorant that which was near has become distant and again that which was distant is near for those who realize the lord as he is it is like the sugar water made from the candy only one who drinks it knows its taste unto whom should i speak your speech o lord it is beyond the three qualities is there anyone with such discerning wisdom says kabeer as i s the fuse which you apply so is the flash you will see gauree there is no rainy season ocean sunshine or shade no creation or destruction there no life or death no pain or pleasure is felt there there is only the primal tra nce of samaadhi and no duality the description of the state of intuitive poise is indescribable and sublime it is not measured and it is not exhausted it is neither light nor heavy neither lower nor upper worlds are t here neither day nor night are there there is no water wind or fire there the true guru is contained the inaccessible and unfathomable lord dwells there within himself by gurus grace he is found says kabeer i am a sacrifice to my guru i remain in the saadh sangat the company of the holy gauree with both sin and virtue the ox of the body is purchased the air of the breath is the capital which has appeared the bag on its back is filled with desire this is h ow we purchase the herd 1 my lord is such a wealthy merchant he has made the whole world his peddler sexual desire and anger are the tax collectors and the waves of the mind are the highway robbers the five elements join together and divide up their loot this is how our herd is disposed of says kabeer listen o saints this is the state of affairs now going uphill the ox has grown weary throwing off his load he continues on his journey gauree panch padas for a few short days the soul bride stays in her parents house then she must go to her in laws the blind foolish and ignorant people do not know this tell me why is the bride wearing her ordinary clothes the guests have arrived at her home and her husband has come to take her away who has lowered the rope of the breath down into the well of the world which we see the rope of the breath breaks away from the pitcher of the body and the water carrier gets up and departs334 when the lord and master is kind and grants his grace then her affairs are all resolved then she is known as the happy soul bride if she contemplates the word of the gurus shabad bound by the actions she has committed she wanders around see this and understand what can we say to her what can the poor soul bride do disappointed and hopeless she gets up and departs there is no support or encouragement in her consciousness so remain attached to the lords lotus feet and hurry to his sanctuary kabeer gauree the yogi says that yoga is good and sweet and nothing else is o siblings of destiny those who shave their heads and those who amputate their li mbs and those who utter only a single word all say that they have attained the spiritual perfection of the siddhas 1 without the lord the blind ones are deluded by doubt and those to whom i go to find release they themselves are bound by a ll sorts of chains the soul is re absorbed into that from which it originated when one leaves this path of errors the scholarly pandits the virtuous the brave and the generous all assert that they alone are great he alone understands whom the lord inspires to understand without understanding what can anyone do meeting the true guru the darkness is dispelled and in this way the jewel is obtained give up the evil actions of your left and right hands and grasp hold of the feet of the lord says kabeer the mute has tasted the molasses but what can he say about it if he is asked raag gauree poorbee kabeer jee one universal creator god by the grace of the true guru where something existed now there is nothing the five elements are no longer there the ida the pingala and the sushmanaa o human being how can the breaths through these be counted now the string has been broken and the sky of the tenth gat e has been destroyed where has your speech gone this cynicism afflicts me night and day who can explain this to me and help me understand pause where the world is the body is not there the mind is not there either the joiner is forever unattached now within whom is the soul said to be contained by joining the elements people cannot join them and by breaking they cannot be broken until the body perishes of whom is the soul the master and of whom is it the servant where and to whom does it go says kabeer i have lovingly focused my attention on that place where the lord dwells day and night only he himself truly knows the secrets of his mystery he is eternal and indestructible gauree let contemplation and intuitive meditation be your two ear rings and true wisdom your patched overcoat in the cave of silence dwell in your yogic posture let the subjugation of desire be your spiritual path o my king i am a yogi a hermit a renunciate i do not die or suffer pain or separation the solar systems and galaxies are my horn the whole world is the bag to carry my ashes eliminating the three qualities and finding release from this world is my de ep meditation my mind and breath are the two gourds of my fiddle and the lord of all the ages is its frame335 the string has become steady and it does not break this guitar vibrates with the unstruck melody hearing it the mind i s enraptured and becomes perfect it does not waver and it is not affected by maya says kabeer the bairaagee the renunciate who has played such a game is not reincarnated again into the world of form and substance gauree nine yards ten yards and twenty one yards weave these into the full piece of cloth take the sixty threads and add nine joints to the seventy two on the loom life weaves itself into its patterns leaving her home the soul goes to the world of the weaver this cloth cannot be measured in yards or weighed with weights its food is two and a half measures if it does not obtain food right away it quarrels with the master of the house how many days will you sit he re in opposition to your lord and master when will this opportunity come again leaving his pots and pans and the bobbins wet with his tears the weaver soul departs in jealous anger the windpipe is empty now the thread of the breath does not come out any longer the thread is tangled it has run out so renounce the world of form and substance while you remain here o poor soul says kabeer you must understand this gauree when one light merges into another what b ecomes of it then that person within whose heart the lords name does not well up may that person burst and die meeting with the holy the perfection of the sid dhas is obtained what good is yoga or indulgence in pleasures when the two meet together the business is conducted and the link with the lords name is established people believe that this is just a song but it is a meditation on god it i s like the instructions given to the dying man at benares whoever sings or listens to the lords name with conscious awareness says kabeer without a doubt in the end he obtains the highest status gauree those who try to do things by their own efforts are drowned in the terrifying world ocean they cannot cross over those who practice religious rituals and strict self discipline their egotistical pride shall consume their minds your lord and maste r has given you the breath of life and food to sustain you oh why have you forgotten him human birth is a priceless jewel which has been squandered in exchange for a worthless shell the thirst of desire and the hunger of doubt af flict you you do not contemplate the lord in your heart intoxicated with pride you cheat yourself you have not enshrined the word of the gurus shabad within your mind those who are deluded by sensual pleasures who are tempted by sexual de lights and enjoy wine are corrupt but those who through destiny and good karma join the society of the saints float over the ocean like iron attached to wood i have wandered in doubt and confusion through birth and reincarnation now i a m so tired i am suffering in pain and wasting away says kabeer meeting with the guru i have obtained supreme joy my love and devotion have saved me gauree like the straw figure of a female elephant fashioned to trap the bull elephant o crazy mind the lord of the universe has staged the drama of this world336 attracted by the lure of sexual desire the elephant is captured o crazy mind and now the halter is placed around its neck so escape from corruption a nd immerse yourself in the lord take this advice o crazy mind you have not meditated fearlessly on the lord o crazy mind you have not embarked upon the lords boat pause the monkey stretches out its hand o crazy mind and takes a han dful of corn now unable to escape o crazy mind it is made to dance door to door like the parrot caught in the trap o crazy mind you trapped by the affairs of maya like the weak dye of the safflower o crazy mind so is the expanse of this world of form and substance there are so many holy shrines in which to bathe o crazy mind and so many gods to worship says kabeer you shall not be saved like this o crazy mind only by serving the lord will you find release gauree fire does not burn it and the wind does not blow it away thieves cannot get near it accumulate the wealth of the lords name that wealth does not go anywhere my wealth is god the lord of wealth the lord of the unive rse the support of the earth this is called the most excellent wealth the peace which is obtained by serving god the lord of the universe that peace cannot be found in kingdoms or power 1 shiva and sanak in their search for this wealth became udaasees and renounced the world one whose mind is filled with the lord of liberation and whose tongue chants the name of the lord shall not be caught by the noose of death my own wealth is the spiritual wisdom and devotion given by the guru my mind is held steady in perfect neutral balance it is like water for the burning soul like an anchoring support for the wandering mind the bondage of doubt and fear is dispelled says kabeer o you who are intoxicated wit h sexual desire reflect upon this in your heart and see within your home there are hundreds of thousands millions of horses and elephants but within my home is the one lord gauree like the monkey with a handful of grain who will not let go because of greed just so all the deeds committed in greed ultimately become a noose around ones neck without devotional worship human life passes away in vain without the saadh sangat the company of the holy without vibrating and meditating on the lord god one does not abide in truth like the flower which blossoms in the wilderness with no one to enjoy its fragrance so do people wander in reincarnation over and over again they are destroyed by death this wealth youth children and spouse which the lord has given you this is all just a passing show those who are caught and entangled in these are carried away by sensual desire age is the fire and the body is the hou se of straw on all four sides this play is being played out says kabeer to cross over the terriffying world ocean i have taken to the shelter of the true guru gauree the water of the sperm is cloudy and the egg of the ov ary is crimson from this clay the puppet is fashioned i am nothing and nothing is mine this body wealth and all delicacies are yours o lord of the universe337 into this clay the breath is infused by your power yo u have set this false contrivance in motion some collect hundreds of thousands of dollars but in the end the pitcher of the body bursts says kabeer that single foundation which you have laid will be destroyed in an instant you are so egotistical gauree just as dhroo and prahlaad meditated on the lord so should you meditate on the lord o my soul o lord merciful to the meek i have placed my faith in you along with all my family i hav e come aboard your boat when it is pleasing to him then he inspires us to obey the hukam of his command he causes this boat to cross over by gurus grace such understanding is infused into me my comings and goings in reincarnation have ended says kabeer meditate vibrate upon the lord the sustainer of the earth in this world in the world beyond and everywhere he alone is the giver gauree 9 he leaves the womb and comes in to the world as soon as the air touches him he forgets his lord and master pause you were upside down living in the womb you generated the intense meditative heat of tapas then you escaped the fire of the belly after wandering through 84 million incarnations you came if you stumble and fall now you shall find no home or place of rest says kabeer meditate vibrate upon the lord the sustainer of the earth he is not seen to be coming or going he is the knower of all gauree poorbee dont wish for a home in heaven and dont be afraid to live in hell whatever will be will be so dont get your hopes up in your mind sing the glorious praises of the lord from whom the most excellent treasure is obtained what good is chanting penance or self mortification what good is fasting or cleansing baths unless you know the way to worship th e lord god with loving devotion dont feel so delighted at the sight of wealth and dont weep at the sight of suffering and adversity as is wealth so is adversity whatever the lord proposes comes to pass says kabeer now i know that the lord dwells within the hearts of his saints that servant performs the best service whose heart is filled with the lord gauree o my mind even if you carry someones burden they dont belong to you this world is like the perch of the bird on the tree i drink in the sublime essence of the lord with the taste of this essence i have forgotten all other tastes why should we weep at the death of others when we ourselves are not per manent whoever is born shall pass away why should we cry out in grief we are re absorbed into the one from whom we came drink in the lords essence and remain attached to him says kabeer my consciousness is filled with thoughts of remembr ance of the lord i have become detached from the world raag gauree the bride gazes at the path and sighs with tearful eyes338 her heart is not happy but she does not retrace her steps in hopes of seeing the blessed vision of the lords darshan so fly away black crow so that i may quickly meet my beloved lord says kabeer to obtain the status of eternal life worship the lord with devotion the name of the lord is my only support with m y tongue i chant the lords name raag gauree 11 all around there are thick bushes of sweet basil and there in the midst of the forest the lord is singing with joy beholding his wondrous beauty the milk maid was entrance d and said please dont leave me please dont come and go my mind is attached to your feet o archer of the universe he alone meets you who is blessed by great good fortune in brindaaban where krishna grazes his cows he entices and fascinates my mind you are my lord master the archer of the universe my name is kabeer gauree poorbee 12 many people wear various robes but what is the use of living in the forest what good does it do if a man burns incense before his gods what good does it do to dip ones body in water o soul i know that i will have to depart you ignorant idiot understand the imperishable lord whatever you see you will not see that again but still you cling to maya the spiritual teachers meditators and the great preachers are all engrossed in these worldly affairs says kabeer without the name of the one lord this world is blinded by maya gauree 12 o people o victims of this maya abandon your doubts and dance out in the open what sort of a hero is one who is afraid to face the battle what sort of satee is she who when her time comes starts collecting her pots and pans stop you r wavering o crazy people now that you have taken up the challenge of death let yourself burn and die and attain perfection the world is engrossed in sexual desire anger and maya in this way it is plundered and ruined says kab eer do not forsake the lord your sovereign king the highest of the high gauree 13 your command is upon my head and i no longer question it you are the river and you are the boatman salvation comes from you o human being embrace the lords meditation whether your lord and master is angry with you or in love with you your name is my support like the flower blossoming in the water says kabeer i am the slave of your home i live or di e as you will gauree wandering through 84 million incarnations krishnas father nand was totally exhausted because of his devotion krishna was incarnated in his home how great was the good fortune of this poor man you say that krishna was nands son but whose son was nand himself when there was no earth or ether or the ten directions where was this nand then339 pause he does not fall into misfortune and he does not take birth his name is the immaculate lord kabeers lord is such a lord and master who has no mother or father gauree slander me slander me go ahead people and slander me slander is pleasing to the lords humble servant slander is my father slander is my mother if i am slandered i go to heaven the wealth of the naam the name of the lord abides within my mind if my heart is pure and i am slandered then the slanderer washes my clothes one who slanders me is my friend the slanderer is in my thoughts the slanderer is the one who prevents me from being slandered the slanderer wishes me long life i have love and affection for the slanderer slander is my salvation slander is the best thing for servan t kabeer the slanderer is drowned while i am carried across o my sovereign lord king you are fearless you are the carrier to carry us across o my lord king when i was then you were not now that you are i am not now you and i have become one seeing this my mind is content when there was wisdom how could there be strength now that there is wisdom strength cannot prevail says kabeer the lord has taken away my wisdom and i have attaine d spiritual perfection gauree he fashioned the body chamber with six rings and placed within it the incomparable thing he made the breath of life the watchman with lock and key to protect it the creator did this in no time at all keep your mind awake and aware now o sibling of destiny you were careless and you have wasted your life your home is being plundered by thieves the five senses stand as guards at the gate but now can they be trus ted when you are conscious in your consciousness you shall be enlightened and illuminated seeing the nine openings of the body the soul bride is led astray she does not obtain that incomparable thing says kabeer the nine openings of the b ody are being plundered rise up to the tenth gate and discover the true essence gauree o mother i do not know any other except him my breath of life resides in him whose praises are sung by shiva and sanak and so many others my heart is illuminated by spiritual wisdom meeting the guru i meditate in the sky of the tenth gate the diseases of corruption fear and bondage have run away my mind has come to know peace in its own true home imbu ed with a balanced single mindedness i know and obey god nothing else enters my mind my mind has become fragrant with the scent of sandalwood i have renounced egotistical selfishness and conceit that humble being who sings and meditates on the praises of his lord and master is the dwelling place of god he is blessed with great good fortune the lord abides in his mind good karma radiates from his forehead i have broken the bonds of maya the intuitive peace and poise of shiva has dawned within me and i am merged in oneness with the one340 says kabeer meeting the guru i have found absolute peace my mind has ceased its wanderings i am happy raag gauree poorbee baawan akhree of kabeer jee one universal creator god truth is the name creative being personified by gurus grace through these fifty two letters the three worlds and all things are described these letters shall perish they cannot describe the imperishable lord wh erever there is speech there are letters where there is no speech there the mind rests on nothing he is in both speech and silence no one can know him as he is if i come to know the lord what can i say what good does it do to speak he is contained in the seed of the banyan tree and yet his expanse spreads across the three worlds one who knows the lord understands his mystery and bit by bit the mystery disappears turning away from the world ones mind is pierced through with this mystery and one obtains the indestructible impenetrable lord the muslim knows the muslim way of life the hindu knows the vedas and puraanas to instruct their minds people ought to study some sort of spiritual wisdom i know only the one the universal creator the primal being i do not believe in anyone whom the lord writes and erases if someone knows the one the universal creator he shall not perish since he knows him kakka when the rays of divine l ight come into the heart lotus the moon light of maya cannot enter the basket of the mind and if one obtains the subtle fragrance of that spiritual flower he cannot describe the indescribable he could speak but who would understand khakha the mind has entered this cave it does not leave this cave to wander in the ten directions knowing their lord and master people show compassion then they become immortal and attain the state of eternal dignity gagga one who understand s the gurus word does not listen to anything else he remains like a hermit and does not go anywhere when he grasps the ungraspable lord and dwells in the sky of the tenth gate ghagha he dwells in each and every heart even when the body pitcher bursts he does not diminish when someone finds the path to the lord within his own heart why should he abandon that path to follow some other path nganga restrain yourself love the lord and dismiss your doubts even if you do not see the path do not run away this is the highest wisdom chacha he painted the great picture of the world forget this picture and remember the painter this wondrous painting is now the problem forget this picture and focus your consciou sness on the painter chhachha the sovereign lord of the universe is here with you why are you so unhappy why dont you abandon your desires o my mind each and every moment i try to instruct you but you forsake him and entangle yourself with others jajja if someone burns his body while he is still alive and burns away the desires of his youth then he finds the right way when he burns his desire for his own wealth and that of others then he finds the divine light341 jhajha you are entangled in the world and you do not know how to get untangled you hold back in fear and are not approved by the lord why do you talk such nonsense trying to convince others stirring up arguments you shall only obtain more arguments nyanya he dwells near you deep within your heart why do you leave him and go far away i searched the whole world for him but i found him near myself tatta it is such a difficult path to find him within your own heart open the doors within and enter the mansion of his presence beholding the immovable lord you shall not slip and go anywhere else you shall remain firmly attached to the lord and your heart will be happy thatha keep yourself far away from this mirage with great difficulty i have calmed my mind that cheater who cheated and devoured the whole world i have cheated that cheater and my mind is now at peace dadda when the fear of god wells up other fears depart other fears are absorbed into that fear when one rejects the fear of god then other fears cling to him but if he becomes fearless the fears of his heart run away 19 dhadha why do you search in other directions searching for him like this the breath of life runs out when i returned after climbing the mountain i found him in the fortress the fortress which he himself made nanna the warrior who fights on the battle field should keep up and press on he should not yield a nd he should not retreat blessed is the coming of one who conquers the one and renounces the many tatta the impassable world ocean cannot be crossed over the body remains embroiled in the three worlds but when the lord of the three worlds enters into the body then ones essence merges with the essence of reality and the true lord is attained thatha he is unfathomable his depths cannot be fathomed he is unfathomable this body is impermanent and unstable the mortal builds his dwelling upon this tiny space without any pillars he wishes to support a mansion dadda whatever is seen shall perish contemplate the one who is unseen when the key is inserted in the tenth gate then the blessed vision of the merciful lords darshan is seen dhadha when one ascends from the lower realms of the earth to the higher realms of the heavens then everything is resolved the lord dwells in both the lower and higher worlds leaving the earth the soul ascen ds to the heavens then the lower and higher join together and peace is obtained nanna the days and nights go by i am looking for the lord looking for him my eyes have become blood shot after looking and lookingwhen he is finally foun d then the one who was looking merges into the one who was looked for pappa he is limitless his limits cannot be found i

my fear and now i have come to have faith i thought that he was outside of me but now i know that he is within me when i came to understand this mystery then i recognized the lord mamma clinging to the source the min d is satisfied one who knows this mystery understands his own mind let no one delay in uniting his mind those who obtain the true lord are immersed in delight mamma the mortals business is with his own mind one who disciplines his mind attains perfection only the mind can deal with the mind says kabeer i have not met anything like the mind this mind is shakti this mind is shiva this mind is the life of the five elements when this mind is channeled and guided to enligh tenment it can describe the secrets of the three worlds yayya if you know anything then destroy your evil mindedness and subjugate the body village when you are engaged in the battle dont run away then you shall be known as a spiritu al hero rarra i have found tastes to be tasteless becoming

your mind with sublime perfection refrain from that talk which attracts the heart the heart is attracted when love wells up the king of the three worlds is perfectly pervading and permeating there khakha anyone who seeks him and by seeking him finds him shall not be born again when someone seeks him and comes to understand and contemplate him then he crosses over the terrifying world ocean in

hmi his sorrow departs and he obtains total peace khakha many have wasted their lives and then perished wasting away they do not remember the lord even now but if someone even now comes to know the transitory nature of the world and restrain his mind he shall find his permanent home from which he was separated343 the fifty two letters have been joined together but people cannot recognize the one word of god kabeer speaks the shabad the word of truth one who is a pandit a religious scholar must remain fearless it is the business of the scholarly person to join letters the spiritual person contemplates the essence of reality according to the wisdom within the mind says kabeer so does one come to understand one universal creator god by the grace of the true guru raag gauree thitee the lunar days of kabeer jee shalok there are fifteen lunar days and seven days of the week says kabeer it is neither here nor there when the siddhas and seekers come to know the lords mystery they

have been described the whole world is practicing them what actions will bring emancipation and total perfection one may distinguish between good and evil actions and listen to the vedas and the puraanas but doubt still persists skepticism continually dwells in the heart so who can eradicate egotistical pride outwardly he washes with water but deep within his heart is tarnished by all sorts of vices so how can he become pure hi s method of purification is like that of an elephant covering himself with dust right after his bath with the rising of the sun the night is brought to its end the whole world knows this it is believed that with the touch of the philosopher s stone copper is immediately transformed into gold when one meets the supreme philosophers stone the guru if such pre

entanglements and vices are cut away the mind is restrained and one attains joy contemplating the one lord who is both with and without qualities i have tried many methods but by turning it away the

understands realizes and comprehends what he reads and studies in the end he shall realize that the true lord dwells deep within his nucleus the gurmukh sees and contemplates the true lord without the true lord the world is false dhadha those who enshrine dharmic faith and d well in the city of dharma are worthy their minds are steadfast and stable dhadha if the dust of their feet touches ones face and forehead he is transformed from iron into gold blessed is the support of the earth he himself is not born his measur e and speech are perfect and true only the creator himself knows his own extent he alone knows the brave guru in love with duality spiritual wisdom is lost the mortal rots away in pride and eats poison he thinks that the sublime essence o f the gurus song is useless and he does not like to hear it he loses the profound unfathomable lord through the gurus words of truth the ambrosial nectar is obtained and the mind and body find joy in the true lord he himself is the gurmukh and he himself bestows the ambrosial nectar he himself leads us to drink it in everyone says that god is the one and only but they are engrossed in egotism and pride realize that the one god is inside

whom the lord ble sses with his grace in the gurdwara the gurus door they speak and hear of the lord his light illuminates the ocean and the earth throughout the three worlds is the guru the lord of the world the lord reveals his various forms granting his grace he enters the home of the heart the clouds hang low and the rain is pouring down the lord embellishes and exalts with the sublime word of the shabad one who knows the mystery of the one god is himself the creator himself the divine lord when the sun rises the demons are slain the mortal looks upwards and contemplates the shabad the lord is beyond the beginning and the end beyond the three worlds he himself acts speaks and listens931 he is the architect of destiny he bles ses us with mind and body that architect of destiny is in my mind and mouth god is the life of the world there is no other at all o nanak imbued with the naam the name of the lord one is honored one who lovingly chants the name of the so vereign lord king

mugger maya one who earns the profit of the naam with the capital of faith o nanak is truly honored by the true supreme king the world is ruined on the path of death no one has the power to erase mayas influence if wealth visits the home of the lowliest clown seeing that wealth all pay their respects to him even an idiot is thought of as clever if he is rich without devotional worship the world is insane the one lord is contained among all he reveals himself unto those whom he blesses with his grace thr oughout the ages the lord is eternally established he has no vengeance he is not subject to birth and death he is not entangled in worldly affairs whatever is seen is the lord himself creating himself he establishes himself in the heart he himself is unfathomable he links people to their affairs he is the way of yoga the life of the world living a righteous lifestyle true peace is found without the naam the name of the lord how can anyone find liberation without the name even ones own body is an enemy why not meet the lord and take away the pain of your mind the traveller comes and goes along the highway what did he bring when he came and what will he take away when he goes without the name one loses everywhere the profit is earned when the lord grants understanding in merchandise and trade the merchant is trading without the name how can one find honor and nobility one who contemplates the lords virtues is spiritually wise through his virtues one receives spiritual wisdom how rare in this world is the giver of virtue the true way of life comes through contemplation of the guru the lord is inaccessible and unfathomable932 his worth cannot be estimated they alone meet him whom the lord causes to meet the virtuous soul bride continually contemplates his virtues o nanak following the gurus teachings one meets the lord the true friend unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger waste the body away as gold is dissolved by borax the gold is touched to the touchstone and tested by fire when its pure color shows through it is pleasing to the eye of the assayer the world is a beast and arrogent death is the butcher the created beings of the creator receive the karma of their actions what else can be said there is nothing at all to say searching searching i drink in the ambrosial nectar i have adopted the way of tolerance and given my mind to the true guru everyone calls himself true and genuine he alone is true who obtains the jewel throughout the four ages eating and drinking one dies but still does not know he dies in an instant when he realizes the word of the shabad his consciousness becomes permanently stable and his mind accepts death by guru s grace he realizes the naam the name of the lord the profound lord dwells in the sky of the mind the tenth gate singing his glorious praises one dwells in intuitive poise and peace he does not go to come or come to go by gurus grace he remains lovingly focused on the lord the lord of the mind sky is inaccessible independent and beyond birth the most worthy samaadhi is to keep the consciousness stable focused on him remembering the lords name one is not subject to reincarnatio n the gurus teachings are the most excellent all other ways lack the naam the name of the lord wandering to countless doorsteps and homes i have grown weary my incarnations are countless without limit i have had so many mothers and fat hers sons and daughters i have had so many gurus and disciples through a false guru liberation is not found there are so many brides of the one husband lord consider this the gurmukh dies and lives with god searching in the ten directions i foun d him within my own home i have met him the true guru has led me to meet him the gurmukh sings and the gurmukh speaks the gurmukh evaluates the value of the lord and inspires others to evaluate him as well the gurmukh comes and goes with out fear his filth is taken away and his stains are burnt off the gurmukh contemplates the sound current of the naad for his vedas the gurmukhs cleansing bath is the performance of good deeds for the gurmukh the shabad is the most excellent ambrosia l nectar o nanak the gurmukh crosses over 22 the fickle consciousness does not remain stable the deer secretly nibbles at the green sprouts one who enshrines the lords lotus feet in his heart and consciousness lives long always remembering the lord everyone has worries and cares he alone finds peace who thinks of the one lord when the lord dwells in the consciousness and one is absorbed in the lords name one is liberated and returns home with honor the body falls apart when one knot is untied behold the world is on the decline it wlll be totally destroyed only one who looks alike upon sunshine and shade has his bonds shattered he is liberated and returns home maya is empty and petty she has defrauded the world su ch destiny is pre ordained by past actions youth is wasting away old age and death hover above the head933 the body falls apart like algae upon the water god himself appears throughout the three worlds throughout the ages he is the great giver there is no other at all as it pleases you you protect and preserve us i ask for the lords praises which bless me with honor and credit remaining awake and aware i am pleasing to you o lord when you unite me with yourself then i am merged in you i chant your victorious praises o life of the world accepting the gurus teachings one is sure to merge in the one lord why do you speak such nonsense and argue with the world you shall die repenting when you see your own insanit y he is born only to die but he does not wish to live he comes hopeful and then goes without hope regretting repenting and grieving he is dust mixing with dust death does not chew up one who sings the glorious praises of the lord the nine treasu res are obtained through the name of the lord the lord bestows intuitive peace and poise he speaks spiritual wisdom and he himself understands it he himself knows it and he himself comprehends it one who takes the words of the guru into h is very fiber is immaculate and holy and is pleasing to the true lord

who earns the profit of the true name will not lose it again the lord and master of the three worlds is your best friend control your mind and keep it in its place the world is destroyed by conflict regretting its sinful mistakes there is one husband lord and all are his brides the false bride w ears many costumes he stops her from going into the homes of others he summons her to the mansion of his presence and no obstacles block her path she is embellished with the word of the shabad and is loved by the true lord she is the happy soul bride who takes the support of her lord and master wandering and roaming around o my companion your beautiful robes are torn in jealousy the body is not at peace without the fear of god multitudes are ruined one who remains dead within her own home

but those who are light swim across i am a sacrifice to those who meet the immortal and immeasurable lord the dust of their f eet brings emancipation in their company we are united in the lords union i gave my mind to my guru and received the immaculate name934 i serve the one who gave me the naam i am a sacrifice to him he who builds also demolishes there is no other th an him by gurus grace i

itive ease938 considering his knowledge he finds the essence of reality and lovingly focuses his attention on the name of the lord the self willed manmukh sells his knowledge he earns poison and eats poison the fool does not think of the word of the shabad he has no understanding no comprehension that pandit is called gurmukh who imparts understanding to his students contemplate the naam the name of the lord gather in the naam and earn the true profit in this world with the true n otebook of the true mind study the most sublime word of the shabad o nanak he alone is learned and he alone is a

where egotism does not exist there i sing gods praises 2 whatever the pandits and mullahs have written i reject i do not accept any of it my heart is pure and so i have seen the lord within searching searching within the self kabeer has met the lord no one respects the poor man he may make thousands of efforts but no one pays any att ention to him pause when the poor man goes to the rich man and sits right in front of him the rich man turns his back on him but when the rich man goes to the poor man the poor man welcomes him with respect the p oor man and the rich man are both brothers gods pre ordained plan cannot be erased says kabeer he alone is poor who does not have the naam the name of the lord in his heart 8 serving the guru devotional worship is practice d then this human body is obtained even the gods long for this human body so vibrate that human body and think of serving the lord vibrate and meditate on the lord of the universe and never forget him this is the blessed opportunity of this human incarnation pause as long as the disease of old age has not come to the body and as long as death has not come and seized the body and as long as your voice has not lost its power o mortal being vibrate and meditate on the l ord of the world if you do not vibrate and meditate on him now when will you o sibing of destiny when the end comes you will not be able to vibrate and meditate on him whatever you have to do now is the best time to do it otherwise you shall regret and repent afterwards and you shall not be carried across to the other side he alone is a servant whom the lord enjoins to his service he alone attains the immaculate divine lord meeting with the guru his doors are opened wid e and he does not have to journey again on the path of reincarnation this is your chance and this is your time look deep into your own heart and reflect on this says kabeer you can win or lose in so many ways i have proclaimed this out loud in the city of god sublime understanding prevails there you shall meet with the lord and reflect on him thus you shall understand this world and the next what is the use of claiming that you own everything if you only die in the end i focus my meditation on my inner self deep within the name of the sovereign lord is my spiritual wisdom 1 in the first chakra the root chakra i have grasped the reins and tied them i have firmly placed the moon above the sun the sun blazes forth at the western gate through the central channel of the shushmanaa it rises up above my head 2 there is a stone at that western gate and above that stone is another window above that window is the ten th gate says kabeer it has no end or limitation 2 he alone is a mullah who struggles with his mind and through the gurus teachings fights with death he crushes the pride of the messenger of death1160 unto that mullah i ever offe r greetings of respect god is present right here at hand why do you say that he is far away tie up your disturbing passions and find the beauteous lord he alone is a qazi who contemplates the human body and through the fire of the body is illumined by god he does not lose his semen even in his dreams for such a qazi there is no old age or death he alone is a sultan and a king who shoots the two arrows gathers in his outgoing mind and assembles his army in the realm of the minds sky the tenth gate the canopy of royalty waves over such a sultan the yogi cries out gorakh gorakh the hindu utters the name of raam the muslim has only one god the lord and master of kabeer is all pervading fifth mehl those who call a stone their god their service is useless those who fall at the feet of a stone god their work is wasted in vain my lord and master speaks forever god gives his gifts to all living beings the divine lord is within the self but the spiritually blind one does not know this deluded by doubt he is caught in the noose the stone does not speak it does not give anything to anyone such religious rituals are usel ess such service is fruitless if a corpse is anointed with sandalwood oil what good does it do if a corpse is rolled in manure what does it lose from this says kabeer i proclaim this out loud behold and understand you ignor ant faithless cynic the love of duality has ruined countless homes the lords devotees are forever in bliss the fish in the water is attached to maya the moth fluttering around the lamp is pierced through by maya the sexual desi re of maya afflicts the elephant the snakes and bumble bees are destroyed through maya such are the enticements of maya o siblings of destiny as many living beings are there are have been deceived the birds and the de er are imbued with maya sugar is a deadly trap for the flies horses and camels are absorbed in maya the eighty four siddhas the beings of miraculous spiritual powers play in maya the six celibates are slaves of maya so are the nine master s of yoga and the sun and the moon the austere disciplinarians and the rishis are asleep in maya death and the five demons are in maya dogs and jackals are imbued with maya monkeys leopards and lions cats sheep foxes trees and roots ar e planted in maya 4 even the gods are drenched with maya as are the oceans the sky and the earth says kabeer whoever has a belly to fill is under the spell of maya the mortal is emancipated only when he meets the holy saint as long as he cries out mine mine none of his tasks is accomplished1161 when such possessiveness is erased and removed then god comes and resolves his affairs contemplate such spiritual wisdom o mortal man why not meditate in remembrance on the lord the destroyer of pain as long as the tiger lives in the forest the forest does not flower but when the jackal eats the tiger then the entire forest flowers the

shall receive the fruits of his own actions you are the great giver o lord i am forever a beggar at your door if i were to deny you then i would be a wretched sinner slave kabeer has entered your shelter keep me near you o merciful lord god that is heaven for me everyone speaks of going there but i do not even know where heaven is one who does not even know th e mystery of his own self speaks of heaven but it is only talk as long as the mortal hopes for heaven he will not dwell at the lords feet heaven is not a fort with moats and ramparts and walls plastered with mud i do not know what heavens gate is like says kabeer now what more can i say the saadh sangat the company of the holy is heaven itself how can the beautiful fortress be conquered o siblings of destiny it has double walls and trip le moats pause it is defended by the five elements the twenty five categories attachment pride jealousy and the awesomely powerful maya the poor mortal being does not have the strength to

lord is being worshipped he abandons the lords path and takes the wrong path he forgets the primal lord god and is caught in the cycle of reincarnation he throws away the ambrosial nectar and gathers poison to eat he is like the prostitute who comes to dance wearing beautiful clothes decorated and adorned she dances to the beat exciting the breath of those who watch her but the noose of the messenger of death is around her neck one who has good karma recorded on his forehead hurries to enter the gurus sanctuary says naam dayv consider this o saints this is the way to cross over to the

whom sh ould we complain death takes ones life away without anyones consent do not blame the sovereign lord when someone grows old his intellect leaves him the blind man talks and babbles and then falls into the ditch all that the perfect lord does is perfect there is not too little or too much o nanak knowing this as gurmukh the mortal merges into the perfect lord god1413 shalok third mehl one universal creator god by the grace of the true guru do not cal l the wandering beggars holy men if their minds are filled with doubt whoever gives to them o nanak earns the same sort of merit one who

who could recite the four vedas i could be famous throughout the nine regions of the earth for my wisdom and thoughtful contemplation 3 if a brahmin kills a cow or a female infant and accepts the offerings of an evil person he is cursed with the leprosy of curses and criticism he is forever and ever filled with egotistical pride one who forgets the naam o nanak is covered by coun tless sins let all wisdom be burnt away except for the essence of spiritual wisdom no one can erase that primal destiny written upon ones forehead o nanak whatever is written there comes to pass he alone understands who is blessed by go ds grace those who forget the naam the name of the lord and become attached to greed and fraud are engrossed in the entanglements of maya the enticer with the fire of desire within them those who like the pumpkin vine are too stubborn c limb the trellis are cheated by maya the cheater the self willed manmukhs are bound and gagged and led away the dogs do not join

egotism countless thousands have wasted away to death those who meet with the true guru are saved through the shabad the true word of the inscrutable lord those who serve the true guru single mindedly i fall at the feet of those humble beings through the word of the gurus shabad the lord abides in the mind and the hunger for maya departs immaculate and pure are those humble beings who as gurmukh merge in the naam o nanak other empires are false t hey alone are true emperors who are imbued with the naam the devoted wife in her husbands home has a great longing to perform loving devotional service to him she prepares and offers to him all sorts of sweet delicacies and dishes of all fl avors in the same way the devotees praise the word of the gurus bani and focus their consciousness on the lords name they place mind body and wealth in offering before the guru and sell their heads to him1414 in the fear of god his devotees yearn f or his devotional worship god fulfills their desires and merges them with himself my lord god is self existent and independent what does he need to eat to be satisfied whoever walks in harmony with the will of the true guru and sings the glorious pra ises of the lord is pleasing to him blessed blessed are they in this dark age of kali yuga o nanak who walk in harmony with the will of the true guru those who do not serve the true guru and do not keep the shabad enshrined in their hea rts cursed are their lives why did they even come into the world if one follows the gurus teachings and keeps the fear of god in his mind then he is lovingly attuned to the sublime essence of the lord by his primal destiny he obtains the name o n anak he is carried across the world wanders lost in emotional attachment to maya it does not realize that its

treasures are ove rflowing through the word of the gurus bani they utter the glorious praises of the lord whose end and limitations cannot be found o nanak the creator is the doer of all the creator lord beholds all within the gurmukh is intuitive peace and poise his mind ascends to the tenth plane of the akaashic ethers no one is sleepy or hungry there they dwell in the peace of the ambrosial name of the lord o nanak pain and pleasure do not afflict anyone where the light of the lord the supreme s oul illuminates all have come wearing the robes of sexual desire and anger some are born and some pass away they come and go according to the hukam of the lords command their comings and goings in reincarnation do not end they are imbu ed with the love of duality bound in bondage they are made to wander and they cannot do anything about it those upon whom the lord showers his mercy come and meet the true guru meeting with the true guru they turn away from the world t hey remain dead while still alive with intuitive peace and poise o nanak the devotees are imbued with the lord they are absorbed in the name of the lord the intellect of the self willed manmukh is fickle he is very tricky and clever withi n whatever he has done and all that he does is useless not even an iota of it is acceptable the charity and generosity he pretends to give will be judged by the righteous judge of dharma without the true guru the messenger of death does not leave th e mortal alone he is ruined by the love of duality youth slips away imperceptibly old age comes and then he dies the mortal is caught in love and emotional attachment to children and spouse but none of them will be his helper and support in the end whoever serves the true guru finds peace the name comes to abide in the mind o nanak great and very fortunate are those who as gurmukh are absorbed in the naam the self willed manmukhs do not even think of the name without the name they cry in pain1415 they do not worship the lord the supreme soul how can they find peace in duality they are filled with the filth of egotism they do not wash it away with the word of the shabad o nanak without the name they die in their filth they wa ste the priceless opportunity of this human life the self willed manmukhs are deaf and blind they are filled with the fire of desire they have no intuitive understanding of the gurus bani they are not illumined with the shabad they do not know their own inner being and they have no faith in the gurus word the word of the gurus shabad is within the being of the spiritually wise ones i am forever a sacrifice to them servant nanak is the slave of those gurmukhs who serve the lord the poisonous snake the serpent of maya has surrounded the world with its coils o mother the antidote to

against the guru who has no hatred a t all only sets his own home on fire anger and egotism are within him night and day he burns and suffers constant pain they babble and tell lies and keep on barking eating the poison of the love of duality for the sake of the poison of maya they w ander from house to house and lose their honor they are like the son of a prostitute who does not know the name of his father they do not remember the name of the lord har har the creator himself brings them to ruin the lord showers his mercy upon the gurmukhs and reunites the separated ones with himself servant nanak is a sacrifice to those who fall at the feet of the true guru those who are attached to the naam the name of the lord are saved without the name they must go to the city of death o nanak without the name they find no peace they come and go in reincarnation with regrets when anxiety and wanderings come to an end the mind becomes happy by gurus grace the soul bride understands and then

they are dedicated to the business of the lords name through the word of the shabad the gurmukhs gain recognition in that court of the true lord the true name is their merchandise the true name is their expenditure the love of their beloved fills their inner beings1416 the messenger of death does not even approach them the creator lord himself forgives them o nanak they alone are wealthy who are imbued with the naam the rest of the world is poor the lords name is the support of the lords humble servants without the lords name the there is no other place no place of rest following the gurus teachings the name abides in the mind and one is intuitively automatically absorbed in the lord those with great good fortune meditate on the naam night and day they embrace love for the name servant nanak begs for the dust of their feet i am forever a sacrifice to them the 84 million species of beings burn in desire and cry in pain all this show of emotional attachment to maya shall not

even think of the naam cursed are their lives and cursed are their homes that lord who gives them so mu ch to eat and wear they do not enshrine that lord the treasure of virtue in their minds this mind is not pierced by the word of the shabad how can it come to dwell in its true home the self willed manmukhs are like discarded brides ruined by coming and going in the cycle of reincarnation the gurmukhs are embellished and exalted by the naam the name of the lord the jewel of destiny is engraved upon their foreheads they enshrine the name of the lord har har within their hearts the lord
